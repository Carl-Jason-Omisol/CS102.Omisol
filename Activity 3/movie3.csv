"X-Men: First Class","UniqueParticle","30 August 2020","Exhilarating action, formidable foes, well written, and highly entertaining throughout! I love Matthew Vaughn films or least most of them he's very good at his craft. Kevin Bacon is always great at villain roles along with the rest of the cast is so good. Part of me remembers seeing this in the theater that was fun especially then I had people to go with, in the last several years I mostly go by myself I hope that changes eventually either way X: First Class is exactly what you want it to be!","

"X-Men: First Class","rachel-673-19946","26 May 2011","There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.Which they do. And how!One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.Huh. A prequel that does not, in any way, suck.Amazing, isn't it?-- Rachel Hyland, geekspeakmagazine.com","

"X-Men: First Class","the_rattlesnake25","2 June 2011","Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.Set within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.Instantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.While it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","

"X-Men: First Class","Med-Jasta","4 June 2020","After X3 and Wolverine Origin our expectations for the X-Men franchise were pretty low if not gone completely. This seemed like a last ditch effort by Fox to make something out of X-Men. When pictures were being released I laughed at them with my friend. Beast looked weird and everything looked cheap. I went to the theater thinking, ""I don't know why I'm seeing this it's gonna be stupid.""What they made was so much more than a prequel. A lot of the times when these movies are made there only function is to explain why everything you already know came to be. This actually had a story to tell. And was the beginning of a great franchise. Casting was good. Even their self referential jokes were good.I don't know if Bret Ratner hated X-Men and was deliberately trying to ruin it but he did. Goddamn he did... So much that not only was the past the only place to go by the fact that they used time travel to correct this later on.They made the characters real, who we know but different. They aren't set in their ways yet. Magneto has his evil foundation but he's not there yet. Xavier isn't the teacher but it does come naturally to him. It's fun to see them young doing what kids do.The story is exciting and worth telling. A lot of really cool things happen. The 60s feel it's nice too.Little did we know then they this was the start of saving X-Men.","

"X-Men: First Class","RikerDonegal","1 June 2011","What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.","

"X-Men: First Class","McGrit","31 May 2011","There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably moving manner. This new spin on familiar ""bad guys"" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier's vision and Magneto's contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer's vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more depth to appreciate. I certainly can't wait for a sequel and inclusion of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy.","

"X-Men: First Class","moviexclusive","1 June 2011","The X Men movies followed a similar trajectory to another Marvel property ""Spiderman""- the first movie was a surprising blast, the second built on the merits of the first to deliver ever bigger and better thrills, but the third just knocked the wind out of the sails. And so like any self-respecting franchise would do, you go back to the beginning and start all over again- well, in this case, much much further back to the beginning.The director with the unenviable task of rebooting one of the premier Marvel superhero titles is Matthew Vaughn, best known for subverting the genre last summer with the cult favourite ""Kick-Ass"". Here Vaughn tucks away the subversion for some mainstream summer entertainment and boy does he do a bang-up, and I would say, kick-ass job reviving the franchise.Sure, it probably isn't as fresh as the first ""X Men"", nor as insanely brilliant as ""X2 United"", but Vaughn exceeds all expectations in creating an origins story that captures the heart of what the series was all about. But to do so, Vaughn has gone way back to the 1960s when the United States and Russia were locked in a Cold War and the prospect of World War III came so imminent with the Cuban Missile Crisis.Vaughn in fact begins his story much earlier with a prologue that establishes the childhood days of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Whereas Charles grew up in an affluent but isolated stately home in New York, Erik was locked up in a concentration camp in Poland. It is there Erik first meets the Auschwitz doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who kills Erik's mother in plain sight of him in order to get him to demonstrate his powers. The contrast is key- it is ultimately their childhood circumstances that will have far-reaching repercussions on their divergent paths in life later on.And so while Charles becomes an Oxford academic on genetics and envisions a world where humans and mutants can live in harmony with one another, Erik is plotting his revenge against Shaw and cynical of the very utopia Charles cherishes. But when the fate of the world hangs by a nuclear thread, the two find a common enemy- together with the CIA no less- in Shaw and so put aside their ideological differences to fight alongside each other.It isn't as simple as a union of conveniences- Charles and Erik fast become firm friends, and they band together to start a school for mutants. Among those recruited are the brainbox and soon-to-be-Beast Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), the sonic-screamer and soon-to-be-Banshee Sean Cassidy (Caleb Landry Jones), the plasma-blasting and soon-to-be- Havok Alex Summers (Lucas Till), as well as the winged Angel Salvatore (Zoe Kravitz). Shaw also has his own army- icy Emma Frost (January Jones), teleporter Azaael (Jason Flemyng) and the tornado-spinning Riptide (Alex Gonzalez).There certainly isn't enough time to give each of the multitude of characters a back-story, but at least Vaughn sets aside space within the spectacular action-packed climax for each of them to show off their unique superpowers. Rather, Vaughn and his frequent collaborator Jane Goldman (working off a story by Sheldon Turner and Bryan Singer) give weight instead to the central relationship between Charles and Erik, emphasising on the bond between the two close friends and their eventual descent into bitter enemies as Professor X and Magneto.It is in the intimate character drama between Charles and Erik where the movie achieves its greatest payoff. Some of the best lines in the script are reserved for the witty interplay between the two characters, and are especially thought-provoking in their arguments for and against war and diplomacy. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender also share great bromantic chemistry with each other, and their excellent performances- one the dashing yet dangerous individual, and the other the charming and intelligent fellow- allow the friendship between their characters to be the rightful emotional heart of the film.But to bring home the raison d'être for their disagreement is the budding relationship between Hank (aka Beast) and shape-shifting and future-Mystique Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Their constant struggle to accept their extraordinary looks (Raven's blue form and Hank's hands- for-feet) or correct their perceived abnormalities so as to better fit into society crystallise the very humanistic message of the X Men series- that of embracing those who may be different from us, but who have every right as us to belong in our society.Hoult and Lawrence are also outstanding in their own right, and the movie benefits tremendously from strong performances all around. Kevin Bacon is all smarmy menace as Shaw, while Rose Bryne brings a welcome touch of humanism as the rare human in the film to accept these extraordinaires. Veteran character players James Remar, Michael Ironside and Ray Wise add a touch of class to the proceedings, while fanboys will delight over a killer cameo in the movie. The person who deserves credit for pulling it all together is Vaughn, who so deftly mixes fact and fiction to create an awfully plausible version of alternate reality. Ingenious was the move to situate the might-vs-right dynamic between Charles and Erik against the backdrop of the Cold War, the events of history providing both significance and gravitas, and Vaughn stages the events with terrific pacing and much aplomb. With ""X Men: First Class"", Vaughn has breathed new life into a franchise that ran aground with its bland and formulaic ""Last Stand"" and an otherwise unremarkable ""Wolverine"" spin off. Admittedly, the storytelling could have been smoother, but Vaughn's reimagining of the X Men universe is more than robust, especially with an intelligent tightly-plotted script, outstanding lead performances and thrilling action sequences. It may not match the brilliance of Bryan Singer's first two films, but this is perhaps as close as it gets.","

"X-Men: First Class","Joejoesan","27 May 2011","Normally prequel movies are made because the main characters of the first movie died (or in the end achieved their goals) and the producers still want to make money out of the franchise. Think Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Psycho, the (still to be made?) I am legend and of course George Lucas's Star Wars saga. X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that. Director Matthew Vaughn created a great, thrilling and sometimes even moving picture that without any doubt will get raving reviews and be a huge commercial success. God knows both movie and director deserve it.What makes X-Men First Class really work is the great story. It tells us about the beginning of the mutants and especially the friendship between professor X (a charming James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (an impressive Michael Fassbender). Although they will drift apart at some time, you know that they will always have respect for each other. In this stage they even become close friends. The movie opens during World War 2, when young boy Erik is taken to a concentration camp (like the opening of the first X-Men movie). There he meets Sebestian Shaw (a great Kevin Bacon), a scary Joseph Mengele-like scientist who likes to experiment on Jews and is especially interested in mutants. In order to force Erik into helping him he shoots his mother. Erik never forgives him for that and spends his whole life looking for revenge. Unfortunately he learns that Shaw is also a mutant. The scientist is even so powerful that it's almost impossible for Erik to kill him. Luckily he bumps into Charles Xavier...What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.The performances in First Class are first rate. Kevin Bacon is a brilliant villain. His German is actually quite good and his opening scene can already be considered as a classic. He also speaks Russian in the movie by the way. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) represents the most exciting drama in the story. He's kinda like Darth Vader. You know he will turn to the Dark Side but you still hope that somehow he will stick with professor X.First Class will be the beginning of super stardom for actress Jennifer Lawrence. She plays Raven in the story, a girl Xavier adopts as a real sister/best friend. She later becomes Mystique. Jennifer won critical acclaim with her role in Winter Bone and will play the lead in the much anticipated The Hunger Games movie, to be released in 2012. She is a great, vulnerable Mystique who later on chooses Magneto over 'her brother' Professor X. So what's more to tell? January Jones as Emma Frost is sexy as hell, the special effects in the movie are great and there are not one but two cameos from actors from the first X-Men movie (and no, the second one is not Patrick Stewart). Unlike previous Marvel movies there is no extra scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not have a small part in this one. Overall First Class makes you think of the Sean Connery Bond movies and the reboot of Star Trek (2009).So... are you convinced? Just go see this excellent movie. Can't wait for its sequel!9/10","

"X-Men: First Class","TheLittleSongbird","3 September 2011","I liked this movie a great deal, while not as good as the first two movies it is an improvement on Wolverine. It is not among my favourite superhero movie but I can think of worse. It is not perfect by all means, while it was good to start with with a touch of atmosphere some of the music later on became rather generic and Jennifer Lawrence I had mixed feelings on, great looks and personality but sometimes forced delivery and her character being not as well developed as the rest. The visuals however are spectacular, with imaginative photography and editing and first-class special effects, costumes, lighting and settings. The story is mostly compelling with the action/thriller based moments genuinely intense and cracking while making way for some nuances on the social and political side of things. The script is well written too with some memorable lines, the film is well paced generally and Matthew Vaughan's direction is what makes the film so fresh. The acting is fine mostly, Kevin Bacon is a good and charismatic villain but James McAvoy and especially Michael Fassbender are terrific. Overall, very good and fresh. 8/10 Bethany Cox","

"X-Men: First Class","Leofwine_draca","20 May 2014","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is a film that aims to breathe new life into a somewhat tired franchise (so far consisting of the original trilogy and two stand-alone Wolverine stories) by telling the back story of the Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen characters from the original movies. Thus we're handed a bright young cast of up-and-comers who engage in their own superhero adventures.The setting is the early '60s, at the height of the Cold War. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, playing the early versions of Stewart and McKellen respectively, recruit some familiar and not-so familiar mutants to help them wage a war against generic bad guy Kevin Bacon. What follows is watchable but overlong and fairly underwhelming, offering exactly the kind of CGI-heavy spectacle as the other films in the series while failing to engage the brain properly at any time.It goes without saying that McAvoy and Fassbender - particularly the latter - are by far the best things in this movie. The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Lawrence, are lacklustre and some of them, such as Nicholas Hoult playing a goofy boffin, are downright embarrassing. Bacon's on autopilot, while Rose Byrne gives one of the most excruciatingly wooden turns I've seen in recent months, a surprise given she was pretty good in previous movies like SUNSHINE and 28 WEEKS LATER.Like the STAR WARS prequels, this film was conceived of a way of starting afresh while at the same time bringing back some old and much-loved characters who are a guaranteed box-office draw. But the film rings fairly hollow, and while it works as a bit of spectacle, it's one of those movies you forget about straight after. It says something that the most excitement I had was seeing one of my favourite character actors, Michael Ironside, in a role amounting to little more than a cameo as a ship's captain. I find Matthew Vaughn a hit and miss director and this is more miss than hit, unfortunately.","

"X-Men: First Class","claudio_carvalho","3 September 2011","In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) brings Erik to his office and kills his mother, increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets the mutant Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and invites her to live in his manor.In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers the existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier to recruit mutants to work for the USA government. Xavier teams up with Raven, Erik and a group of young mutants. Sooner they learn that the evil Shaw has the intention of beginning a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power. ""X-Men: First Class"" is an entertaining film for fans of action films with superheroes that discloses the beginning of the saga of the mutants. The plot has many flaws, like for example: why Erik destroys Dr. Shaw's office, kills the guards but does not destroy the killer Shaw? How Xavier and Raven become best friends after a five- minute dialog? Why the lack of gratitude of Raven after the accident with Xavier in the end? The power of Azazel is so exaggerated that becomes impossible to be defeated.Kevin Bacon is a great villain and the insertion in the context of the Cold War and using the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as background is a funny joke. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Primeira Classe"" (""X-Men: First Class"")","

"X-Men: First Class","Movie_Muse_Reviews","9 June 2011","Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons has been the origin story. ""Spider-Man"" in 2002 revealed how the emotional power of a superhero's motivation can humanize even those characters with the most extraordinary powers. ""X-Men: First Class"" provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the ""X-Men"" world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto encapsulates the comics' core. ""First Class"" recognizes this all the way.When the action-packed but unmoving ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was announced, it came coupled with the hiring of a writer for ""X-Men Origins: Magneto."" ""First Class"" essentially gives us that story. This is a film about Erik's decision to become Magneto and Michael Fassbender revels in the spotlight as the powerful metal-bender who eventually leads what becomes the Brotherhood of Mutants. Fassbender will continue to be an acting force to reckon with in the future as he brings incredible depth to a character already written so well.""X-Men: First Class"" has to be the best-written superhero film since ""The Dark Knight"" and maybe ever behind the first two ""Spider-Man"" films. The script is loaded with thematic insights into the notion of being an outsider — the very notion that's made this comic so universally loved. The fascinating complexity of Magneto and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) gets abundant attention and even the minor characters exude that feeling of learning to embrace and understand their powers and differences for the first time.The film opens with a scene directly from the original ""X-Men"": a young Erik at a concentration camp gets separated from his mother and bends a metal gate. A Nazi doctor takes note of this ability and meets with Erik, eventually killing his mother in front of him as to provoke the anger that triggers Erik's powers. That villain happens to be a mutant himself, one who in the '60s becomes known as Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik's one goal is to avenge that death. This background alone, that of a Holocaust survivor, makes Erik such a challenging character for an audience. In his pursuit of Shaw, Erik meets Charles (James McAvoy), whose own quest to find other mutants with the help of a young CIA agent named Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) also has him tracking Shaw. As it happens, Shaw's plan is to incite the Cuban Missile Crisis and start a nuclear war, setting the stage for mutant supremacy.Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are tough shoes to fill, but Fassbender and McAvoy make those characters their own while commanding the screen much like those venerated talents. Despite the film leaning heavily toward Magneto's story, McAvoy impresses here as a rallying leader figure. He has a youthful charisma that a bald wheelchair-bound Professor X never gets the luxury of wielding in the original films, but he demonstrates a maturity we've never gotten to see from McAvoy, who's always playing teenage or 20-something characters thanks to his boyish looks. The chemistry between him and Fassbender echoes that between McKellan and Stewart but in a much different way. With this film now in the ""X-Men"" canon, I think revisiting the original trilogy would actually make the original films' Magneto-Professor X subplots more powerful. That's how well the writing team captures their relationship and story despite the many other things going on.Director Matthew Vaughn strikes a nice balance between the grittiness of a ""Layer Cake"" and the superhero fun of ""Kick-Ass."" Vaughn milks the most he can out of a PG-13 rating as some gruesome deaths are left to the imagination or shown simply without the blood. Graphic enough or not, ""First Class"" keeps a dark tone with the exception of all the teenage mutants learning to control and showing off their powers. Even then, they remain firmly rooted in the script's core ideas and messages.""First Class"" forces you to keep track of several mutants, but only a couple feel hollow or ineffective. Despite being a comic book icon, Emma Frost appears to be nothing but a fembot as played by January Jones. A telepath like Professor X but with the ability to turn her skin into diamonds, she serves Shaw with seemingly no regard for her own interests, whatever they may be. Jones provides no edginess to the character, who essentially serves the same purpose as Mystique in the original films as the faithful but alluring evil ""assistant.""Lawrence as Raven aka Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank aka Beast represent an effective use of subplot. Both play young mutants who possess powers that exhibit physical characteristics. As young people, they wrestle with questions of fitting in or embracing who they are, which echoes the larger Erik/Charles storyline on a smaller scale.Regardless your thoughts on ""X-Men: First Class"" as a stand-alone film, it unquestionably does great justice to the power of the ""X-Men"" story as a whole and reminds us why this message has universal qualities that all can identify with. Not only are there the questions of conformity, but also of human nature. The climax reminds us of one of the major differences between Charles and Erik: one has faith that humanity will come to accept mutants and the other doesn't. Although we've been trained to agree with Charles since Bryan Singer's first film in 2000, ""First Class"" helps us come to realize the power of Magneto's argument, proving he's not so much a villain, but a character with a darker and perhaps more realistic world view.The talent runs very deep in this retro-fitted backstory to the ""X-Men"" universe that refocuses the franchise for the better. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","

"X-Men: First Class","Logan8888","24 May 2011","Fox can breath easy again because I think it's safe to say the even the extreme fanboys will be putting down their pitchforks and torches and smile after seeing this amazing film. I know for a fact that general audiences are going to love this movie. I know some fans can be irrational and hold on to their hate because they expect certain things they read in their books but I can't seeing anyone being that irrational when faced with a result that delivers what First Class manages to deliver. It honestly is a genre-defining movie on a level with any comic based film that has come before it. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better than what Fox delivered in their last two efforts with this franchise. Going back to the beginning and re-hiring the guy that brought us those films was a splendid idea. The acting here is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have on display. No cartoonish villains or cheese in sight, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. If not a genre-defining movie than maybe it redefines the comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that we saw in X2. In fact, it perfectly complements that great film and probably surpasses it.This film is to X2 what Godfather 2 was to the Godfather. Seriously, First Class is an exceptional ""flashback"" look that links the best of the X-Men trilogy to the past. Instead of DeNiro playing young Vito Corleone we get James McAvoy as young Charles Xavier. Marlon Brando and Patrick Stewart made their respective characters popular but both were more fleshed out by incredible younger talent. I'm not placing the X-Men film itself on a par with the Godfather but both have become legendary in their particular genre. I am, however, saying McAvoy has a bright future as a complex and talented actor. Just like the young cast of Godfather 2 was legendary, the young cast of First Class has many great days and projects ahead of them.Love this entire cast but Michael Fassbender delivers the best performance with an amazing presence and command of the screen. Everyone was extraordinary. What many expected indeed happens. By that I mean every scene that Fassbender and McAvoy are in together absolutely sing. It won't surprise anyone to know that Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in supporting roles but Nicholas Hoult did stunning work as the Beast and deserves some love as well. January Jones and Rose Byrne are hot as can be but aren't just simple eye candy. Sure, the story is compelling and the action is amazing but the performances elevate this movie far above a common summer flick.Movie of the year so far...","

"X-Men: First Class","Aaron1375","6 June 2011","This X-men movie was great, out of all the X-men films this one ranks second to the second as X2 still holds the title as number one X-men film. This one is not to far behind, the only reason I did not give it a 10 are some problems this one has when tied with the other films. I know they say it is a reboot, but if that were the case why were there so many things tying this to the other films? Seriously, in a reboot you would change costumes and looks of characters, in this one when the young X-men wear their costumes for the first time Beast's costume looks like the one he wore in The Last Stand when he commented that he could not believe it used to fit him. That and it opened with a scene that looked as if it came right out of the first film, the awakening of a young Magento's powers. Enough of whether it is a prequel or a reboot, what it was for me was an entertaining film. The story has Eric (later to be known as Magneto) trying to find the man responsible for the death of his mother, a man who goes by the name of Sebastian Shaw. Meanwhile, Charles Xavier is writing papers and is a bit of a flirt as he and a young woman by the name of Raven have formed a special bond. Well it is not long before the two meet up as there is a wonderful scene where Eric finds Sebastian, and the army finds them both on Sebastian's boat. They soon join up and begin recruiting other mutants as Shaw has other mutants working for him so they think they need more to help in their struggle against him. The action is great here culminating in a great battle at the end and the full awakening of Magneto's powers. The effects are really good in this one too as is the acting. Nice to see Kevin Bacon in an extended role in this movie, when I first saw he was going to appear in this one I was afraid it would be nothing more than an extended cameo. The guy they got to play Magneto was great as I could actually see him looking like Ian McKellen when he ages. The guy playing Xavier is good too, just do not see him looking much like Patrick Stewart, but this goes back to the point of whether this is a prequel to those films or a reboot. I am sorry, but to me it seems like a prequel so the thing that happens to Charles at the end of this one does not really work in the context of the third film as in that one he and Eric visit a young Jean Grey and Charles is walking, also the fact that at the end of this one they are essentially against each other so chances are they would not be visiting her together unless even Eric felt her powers were in need of guidance at the time so he agreed to accompany Charles because of her being such a special case. Also, the end of Wolverine has an appearance of Charles at the end and he is walking, this one can be explained as the appearance of Charles could be akin to what Emma Frost did to the Russian dude here in that he simply made himself appear to the young X-men. Like I said though this may be a reboot making all these points groundless except for the many things tying this film to the other four movies. Other than this gripes it was a totally solid film, the best I have seen so far in the summer of 2011, mind you there are still many movies I intend to see. I also have to say this film features one of the best villain deaths ever, of course after that death the birth of one of the best villains ever begins.","

"X-Men: First Class","mad_mandonna","1 June 2011","I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.The Direction is great, Vaughn's clearly got a knack for angles and keeping the audience engaged whilst the story chops and changes. The look of the film is modern, yet still has a 60's and almost retro look about it. The special effects are very good, though some how not quite up there with Xmen: The Last Stand. The energy is fast and relentless and the action sequences blend in with the dialogue sequences seamlessly.The acting is very good, though Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are definitely missed, McAvoy and Fassbender do excellent jobs and really are in keeping with the characters you already know and love. Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw are deliciously malevolent and Moira Mctaggart is perfectly pitched. My only reservation about the acting in the film is of Mystique, who I believe wasn't quite right, her motives in the film don't seem in complete continuity with the rest of the films.A sequel has already been planned and I shall be eagerly awaiting it. Having Storm back in the series would be a personal highlight for myself, but not necessary. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has watched the original films and even for newcomers.One thing I will add that I have noticed since watching the original trilogy is that in 1980 Charles is walking, but according to First Class he loses this ability in the 60's...","

"X-Men: First Class","MBunge","10 June 2011","The fairest things you can say about X-Men: First Class is that it is clearly at least the 3rd best X-film, it may be the best written movie that's ever credited 6 people for the story and screenplay and it is absolutely one of the best prequels that's ever been made. Those all sound like more backhanded compliments that I intend or this motion picture deserves, but they are the most accurate descriptions I can come up with.Set primarily in the early 1960s, the story concerns how Professor X (James McEvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) met and began their lifelong enmity over the place of mutants in human society. They're brought together by their pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Magneto is after him for Shaw killing his mother and torturing him as a boy in a Nazi concentration camp. Professor X has allied himself with the CIA and is after Shaw to stop him from starting a nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR, something Shaw thinks will destroy humanity and empower mutantkind. Each side assembles their own team, with shape-changing Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) among the good mutants and telepathic lingerie fan Emma Frost (January Jones) highlighting the bad guys.The Martin Luther King Jr. vs Malcolm X dynamic between Professor X and Magneto is blended with a plot and visual style straight out of a 1960s spy movie. Now, it's more like a really good Matt Helm flick than James Bond, but these filmmakers use that groovy look and sensibility to create one of the best representations of classic super-hero imagery without it feeling too ""comic booky"". By funneling super-hero tropes through the 60s spy genre, it almost effortlessly normalizes them without having to compromise them.The script juggles a big cast better than any other X-film and about as well as any action flick ever has. Yeah, most of them are cannon fodder or cardboard stand ins, but they're never obtrusive or annoying and they all orbit quite well around the quartet at the heart of the story. The mutant vs. human debate of Professor X and Magento is unfolded into an assimilation vs. racial pride standoff between Mystique and the Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The script even manages to expertly mirror its era by giving Magneto the revolutionary appeal of 1960s social turmoil, and casting Professor X as too weak and accommodating, which deliciously plays off the template of the first two X-films where Magneto was the aging radical still grasping at revolution while the Professor's approach had actually built something meaningful and lasting.The action scenes are good, though they become less effective as they become more overtly super-heroic. There are a couple of tremendous cameos. The continuity of the first two X-films is mostly respected and enhanced. And this movie finally resolves an argument that started with the original motion picture. Yes, Magneto's comic book helmet does look kind of goofy when you faithfully reproduce in the real world.First Class doesn't have the dramatic depth of X-Men or United, but it's a fun, funny and exciting summer experience. It's a shame the flaws of The Last Stand or Wolverine may have soured folks on mutant cinema and scared them away from this one but if you enjoyed the first two films at all, you should definitely give this one a look.","

"X-Men: First Class","jacobmounter","1 June 2011","Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super's would have been good but again this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming xmen movies. I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy","

"X-Men: First Class","wafeys","3 June 2011","What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men offers. This one however, stands above them though for the consideration and tact that has gone into developing these understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie experience.The leading cast do a brilliant job in giving you a sense of their conflict with ingredients such as prejudice, ignorance, a sense of belonging and bitter revenge giving the film a more humane feel than a lot of dramas allowing you to connect with the characters more easily.The special effects- lets not forget, are top notch as expected, but surprisingly very in-keeping with the film and doesn't take away from the other elements of it. The violence is clean but present, pitched right between a young and adult audience. There's also a decent amount of ironic humour thrown in, which, considering the party tricks on offer (by that I mean the powers and peculiarities of the mutants), just comes and goes naturally without feeling forced as like a lot of comedy moments in films of late.Bottom-line, this is a well-constructed, well acted Marvel film. I wasn't totally convinced beforehand, casting James McAvoy as the young Xavier, a full head of hair and northern accent doesn't seem the best fit after all. I can say that he fully realised that role and showed his range in playing a more commanding lead. Michael Fassbender has great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to-be and Mr Bacon adds another interesting element to the story. All the supporting cast give a solid performance with everyone focused on the exciting job at hand and no weak links.Easily worth the cinema admission and thank god they didn't make it in hit-and-miss 3d, there's just no need! The best of the X-men franchise.","

"X-Men: First Class","jonnyhavey","18 June 2011","Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year's ""Kick Ass."" He has redefined the ""X-Men"" series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with ""X-Men: First Class."" Like ""Origins"" there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy (""Wanted"", ""The Conspirator"") and Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Bastards"",""300"") set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, ""Frost/Nixon""). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, ""Winter's Bone""). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Mad Men""). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, ""Bridesmaids"") for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new ""X-Men Trilogy.""The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy's ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender's rugged vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists (Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of ""Mad Men"" flare in a comic strip.The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to impress after the interminable build up.Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan's footsteps as he transforms his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one of the best prequels to ever be made.","

"X-Men: First Class","TourettesPersonal","2 June 2011","The biggest problem of these prequels is it's kind of messy to the original X-Men movies. Well, the filmmakers said this is a reboot but there are some references to the original X-Men series. Anyways, ""X-Men: First Class"" is fun and had a lot of great action. It's the biggest X-Men movie ever made and it's better than the last two X-Men movies.The filmmakers stated that this movie is a reboot but things from the old X-Men movies had an appearance to this movie. The problem of giving reference from the old X-Men movies to this reboot is it doesn't make this movie stand alone. Maybe the references only made for the laughs but if this is a prequel then it'll be a total mess.The best parts goes to the action(obviously). Matthew Vaughn knows how to make big and awesome action scenes. The best parts also goes to the scenes of Michael Fassbender. He really steals the show. He made Erik/Magneto more dangerous than ever. It's fun and intense to see him do something menacing. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. James McAvoy gave a lot of heart to his role. Him and Fassbender had good chemistry.Overall, ""X-Men First Class"" is good especially if you are looking for large scale action. I guess large scale is one thing that's missing to the first four X-Men films. X3 had a large scale action that left us hanging in the end. This one has the action finale that is intense and really big. Maybe the reference of the old X-Men movies is only made for the laughs. By the way this is Matthew Vaughn's thing. There's action plus comedy.","

"X-Men: First Class","Chalice_Of_Evil","1 June 2011","After X-Men Origins: Wolverine botched the franchise's first prequel; it's understandable why this movie was met with some trepidation. Thankfully, where that movie failed...this one succeeds, and unlike other prequels, it offers some surprises. Although we begin in familiar territory with an almost-shot-for-shot redo of the first movie's opening, as young Erik Lehnsherr's separated from his parents, causing him to manifest his powers (bending a gate), *this* time we see there's more going on, as a scientist (played by Kevin Bacon) wants another demonstration of Erik's power, which he's unable to do until his mother is killed...THEN he shows what he's capable of (including crushing soldiers' heads with their own helmets).Meanwhile, a young Charles Xavier meets a young Raven Darkholme/future Mystique when she's stealing food. They quickly become friends; we then fast-forward to them older, where Charles Xavier isn't quite what you'd expect. He's chugging booze, using 'Heterochromia'/explanations of mutation to pick up women (the line from Annabelle Wallis' character, ""Mutant and proud."", which Raven starts out mocking, takes on a deeper meaning by film's end) and there's a weird brotherly/sisterly-with-hints-of-maybe-more-dynamic between him/Raven. James McAvoy's Charles is amusing in how NOT-like Patrick Stewart's interpretation he is, but when the occasion calls for it, you can see the future Professor X in him. Too bad he didn't quit doing that stupid-looking-and-totally-unnecessary-two-fingers-on-his-temple gesture whenever he used his powers.Still, at least it's wasn't as bad as grown-up Erik's constipation face/jazz hands gesture he makes whenever controlling metal. Aside from that (and his wavering accent), Michael Fassbender's easily the film's stand-out, as he brings SO much depth/nuance to the character. There's one particularly memorable scene in a bar where he shows just how ruthless he can be (the music/'theme' that plays whenever he unleashes his power adds a lot). His desire for revenge against his mother's killer (now known as Sebastian Shaw, who's a mutant that can absorb power and use it however he sees fit with devastating results) leads to him crossing paths with Charles...who saves Erik from himself. Like Stewart/McKellen before them, McAvoy/Fassbender quickly develop a believable/easy chemistry, you can totally buy them becoming friends...albeit ones with different outlooks on how humanity treats mutants.Together they go recruiting a handful of mutants (who we'll never hear about again in the future, so you know they're disposable) along with one we *are* familiar with, a young Hank McCoy (Nichols Hoult). After Charles inadvertently 'outs' him as a mutant-with-hands-for-feet, we soon learn Hank's just as insecure about his mutation/appearance as Raven is, they bond, he asks her for her blood to create a 'cure' for them...then proceeds to unintentionally insult this girl he likes by suggesting she stay human-looking/essentially saying that nobody would EVER find her true form 'beautiful' (this is just after she describes *his* true self as 'beautiful'). Way to go, champ! He pays the price for this, however (props to Hoult for making me feel sorry for Hank when he briefly got his wish of having normal-looking feet...only for it to go so SPECTACULARLY wrong), eventually transforming into Beast (the makeup/prosthetics for Kelsey Grammer's version looked better).Some people apparently had issues with the scene where the young mutants bond, showing off their powers/selecting their 'code names'...but I personally didn't. It's a fun scene, plus them quickly growing close proves important when Shaw attempts to turn them to the Dark Side, resulting in casualties. This shows how out-of-their-depth they are and leads to an enjoyable training montage, with Charles teaching them how to harness their powers/abilities. The sequence does a good job of displaying the powers of Hank (who, pre-transformation, can run really fast...but never does again post-transformation), Havok (unlike his brother, Cyclops, he hula-hoops his 'plasma blasts' at things...inadvertently setting everything-but-his-target alight until Hank builds him a suit that focuses his power more. Speaking of, what's with Havok constantly insulting Hank/Beast? Especially after he made everyone colourful blue/yellow costumes that should please haters of the previous movies' all-black costumes) and Banshee (who screams 'sonic waves' that Charles tells him he can use to fly...which Erik proves with his much more blunt/direct approach than Charles's).Erik 'helps' Raven too, suggesting she stop fighting her true self. Rebecca Romjin's Mystique is a hard act to follow (her cameo here is much-appreciated), J-Law's interpretation isn't 'bad', just 'different'. She's younger/less confident, but has a lot of heart. The most disappointing thing about her is she doesn't really use her abilities as effectively/kick as much butt as her future self will (like what the previous movies did with Rogue). Also on the X-Men's side is the LEAST-Scottish-person-named-MacTaggert-ever (remember Moira from The Last Stand? Hardly anyone does, probably). Rose Byrne does what she can with a rather thankless role, where her going 'undercover' requires her to be as non-covered-up as possible, and during the film's climax, she unintentionally has a hand in Charles becoming forever wheelchair-bound (but as Charles points out to Erik, who's busy blaming/choking Moira, *he's* the main one responsible).On the side of Evil, Kevin Bacon's clearly having fun playing Shaw, though his minions are even LESS interesting/memorable than future Magneto's original Brotherhood of Mutants were (January Jones may look dazzling as Emma Frost in diamond form, but she lacks 'range' in the acting department, red devil guy's certainly no Nightcrawler and tornado dude's a mute). The Cuban missile crisis serving as this movie's setting helps return things to 'basics'/more 'grounded' feel like the first film, character development is treated as more important than flashy powers (rightly so) and while the movie includes foreshadowing of/references to the other films (including an all-time-best Wolverine cameo/one-liner, and check out Magneto's 'dorky-looking helmet' he sports in the film's final scene!), it doesn't *rely* on them. I also appreciated the film's score throughout and the Take That song which plays over the end credits. First Class passes the prequel test by giving us what other prequels FAIL to (ie. Something NEW which also respects what's come before) and deserves an 'X' for X-ceptional work.","

"X-Men: First Class","aaronjbong","24 June 2011","""X-Men: First Class"" is an excellent prequel to the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. It has a compelling storyline chronicling the adventures of Professor X and Magneto, or should I say, Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies, as depicted in the three movies that form the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. Not only a compelling storyline, but ""First Class"" also promises amazing sequences of intense action. ""First Class"" chronicles the adventures of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies. Set in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the two met during a mission in which Xavier and the CIAs are trying to track down a guy named Sebastian Shaw, who apparently is a mutant and acts as a threat to the world. In that time, Xavier found Lensherr trying to stop Shaw from getting away using his mutant powers and told him to let it go as continuing to do so will result in the drowning of Lensherr and Xavier. Later, Lensherr and Xavier become allies and learn of Shaw's intentions of starting World War 3 that would bring mutants into rulers of the world with most of the world in turmoil. Xavier and Lensherr then decide to recruit other mutants and create a mini mutant army to stop Shaw from igniting the start of World War 3. Apart from stopping Shaw, ""First Class"" also tells the story of how Xavier and Lensherr became enemies and split the first generation of X-Men. ""First Class"" is truly a fantastic prequel to the popular ""X-Men"" series. With a compelling storyline, it has action-packed sequences that would keep audiences hooked until the end. The action sequences are much more exciting than that of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should be enjoyed by audiences. Besides the action sequences, the script, and the special effects of the film were excellent. The script had no awkward lines and the special effects of the film were real and life-like. The acting was also great and there was no problem with it. Well done!Humor also plays a role in this film. In serious moments, sometimes to cheer the audiences up, humor is added. The jokes and humor in the movie was pretty funny. Overall, ""First Class"" is a mesmerizing mixture of a compelling storyline, action-packed sequences, amazing special effects, and funny jokes. Matthew Vaughn has crafted a fantastic prequel that serves as a pleasant addition to the ""X-Men"" series (although ""Wolverine"" was disappointing). This movie has great storytelling and awesome sequences of intense action. In terms of recommendation, ""First Class"" is a must-watch summer movie that should be on your list of must-see summer blockbusters of 2011. The compelling storyline will keep audiences interested, the fighting scenes should keep audiences excited, and the special effects should make audiences satisfied with the film. Anyone disappointed with the last ""X- Men"" movie, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", should be relieved after watching the new, fresh, and amazing ""X-Men: First Class"". ""X-Men: First Class"" is truly first-class entertainment. Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)Thank you for reading my review on ""X-Men: First Class"". I do hope that this is a useful review for you to read.","

"X-Men: First Class","julian-mumford","15 June 2011","As if the X-Men franchise was not complicated enough, what with spin off Wolverine and more to come, we now go back to basics with a prequel set in the 1960's, complete with reasonable period detail.The film starts, not unsurprisingly, with the cause of Magneto's reason to hate. Mother and young son are swept up in the persecution of Jews, led by a scene stealing Nazi doctor, Sebastian Shaw. Kevin Bacon, an inspired and unlikely casting choice for this particular role. Whether such background material is suitable for a pure entertainment film, is perhaps debatable but the opening scene is strong and very effective.Perhaps anything that makes a new generation hit Wikipedia to find out more, is no bad thing.Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender) has every intention of enjoying his revenge stone cold and follows the ex-Nazi trail through South America and ending with an early standoff with his nemesis. There follows a very effective SFX scene with a quite spectacular use of a super yachts anchor chain, possibly the most realistic CGI sequence in the film.The story switches to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), initially using his telepathic powers to seduce women in leafy Oxford, whilst attempting to persuade his sister Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) that turning blue occasionally is really not the end of the world.Charles and Erik come together in an uneasy friendship, following Erik's doomed attempt to kill Sebastian and his henchwoman Emma Frost (January Jones), a character that struggles to keep her clothes on throughout the film.The pair come to the attention of the CIA via agent MacTaggert (Rosie Byrne), who discovers mutants led by Sebastian, are keen to push both the USSR and USA towards World War III. A task made easier as the Cuban missile crisis looms large with the very real possibility of nuclear Armageddon.The CIA initially are somewhat reluctant to trust the mutants, but subsequently realise their potential and place them under the very loose control of MIB agent (Oliver Platt), who happens to have a ready built facility for just such an eventuality.The team recruits more mutants and soon we have, Beast (Hoult), Havoc (Lucas Till), Darwin (Gathegi) and Angel (Kravitz) in training for the coming battle ahead.The film is a risky move, prequels or reboots are not always successful; certainly we have a talented cast, good script and competent director in the form of Matthew Vaughan. The studio knows that a successful restart should spawn at least another film, if not two.On the basis of this film they need not worry, this as good as it gets for a comic book reboot. X-Men never intended to emulate the moral complexity and darkness of the Batman franchise, the series always represented a brighter, more colourful world and that tone generally continues here.There are certainly plenty of scantily clad women to attract the target audience but they do get some decent screen time and something to do, notably Jones and Byrne.There is occasional humour to lighten the mood and Fassbender and MacAvoy make a good job of recreating the characters we already know. Bacon is a stand out, especially in the earlier scenes, although there is the faintest whiff of Austin Powers as the story progresses but this is a minor quibble.The film does lag slightly in the middle phase, after a very strong start but picks up for a rousing although necessarily CGI heavy, send off. Most loose ends are tidied up and the stage is set for X-Men the ""middle years"".Whether audiences need another rebooted comic book franchise, remains to be seen but this is quality fare and certainly no quick cash in.Summary Yet another comic book blockbuster but representing solid entertainment, with some fine character recreation, excellent effects and an unusually strong storyline.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/","

"X-Men: First Class","preppy-3","11 June 2011","A rebooting of the X-Men. It gives us the origin of Dr. X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They are no longer brothers--Dr. X is a brilliant scientist and Magneto saw his mother brutally killed in a German concentration camp. Most of this takes place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (so we can have a younger--and hotter--cast). Sebastian Stan (Kevin Bacon) is an evil mutant who (with some followers) wants to start a world wide apocalypse. Dr. X and his band of good mutants set out to stop him.The special effects are top notch and this movie clearly was made on a BIG budget with incredible locations and such...but I was bored. The script is VERY slow and the constant ""winks"" at the audience (dialogue that clearly shows future events) gets tiresome. The evil mutants are never introduced by name (except for Emma Frost) and their powers are never explained leading to confusion (in the audience). Add to that is the totally unnecessary length (this film could have wrapped up in less than 2 hours), plot holes all over the place and historical inaccuracies galore. Even worse some of the acting is terrible--Lucas Till is dreadful as Havoc and McAvoy is bad too. Even worse is Bacon! To top it all off the one black mutant is killed off early on! I thought that kind of scripting went out in the 1960s! It struck me as ridiculously racist. On the good side--Fassbender is GREAT as Magneto and January Jones is terrific as Emma Frost (although she is captured far too easily--and never even attempts to escape). A cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is hysterical and easily the best part of the movie! The use of multiple screens during the training sessions were nice too. But, all in all, I found this boring and pointless. I was looking at my watch more than the screen! A 4 all the way.","

"X-Men: First Class","Vinegaroon3","13 June 2011","Once again, I was prompted into seeing this movie because of extremely high IMDb reviews.I could not disagree more with those who are rating this movie highly. Frankly, I thought it was terrible.Where to begin....I understand a movie dealing with a subject like X-Men requires a large suspension of disbelief. I was actually a fan of the first X-Men movie, but this latest incarnation was bad in so many ways I am not sure I am a sufficiently proficient writer to articulate them....It was cheesy, silly, contrived, largely poorly acted, and simply ridiculous. The plot and antagonist reminded of the worst of the ""James Bond"" franchise, with the villain traveling around in a luxurious submarine with an attractive woman (who could turn herself into a diamond....riiiiight) hanging on his arm. He is going to destroy the world, of course, and smile and laugh while doing it so we will know he is really bad. Lame.Despite spending a lot of time examining the history of the major characters, the film has almost zero effective character development. There is a ""Tinkerbell"" like character who flies around on dragonfly wings and spits fireballs. She of course is knock-out gorgeous, and is discovered while working as a stripper. Yes, I am capable of ""suspending disbelief"", but there was no point here. This was simply painfully stupid.I know nothing of the X-Men comics, but I think the idea is mildly interesting as long as it is kept within limits. They managed to do this with the first movie. However, since the first installment they have become less and less focused on story and character development, and more and more based on ridiculous spectacle.In the larger picture, I am simply going to have to stop paying attention to the ""Best"" ratings that show up first on IMDb when a new film is released. I have wasted too much money seeing highly rated films, like this one, that are simply terrible. I am convinced these reviews are not genuine and are quickly posted when poor films are released in an attempt to salvage some commercial success.I sincerely hope this review will save some of you from making my mistake. This latest X-Men film is awful. Hopefully this review will be visible among the dishonest hype, and save some of you from wasting your time and money.","

"X-Men: First Class","ssvikas","14 June 2011","The success of the prequel, X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009 seems to have prompted the movie makers to shift focus to prequels. In First Class, the story goes back even further and traces the lives of Professor-X/ Charles Xavier and Magneto/ Erik Lehnsherr, their friendship and their eventual fallout. Although the X-Men trilogy had done good business in the last decade, prolonging the same would have meant more battles between Xavier's X-men and Magneto's Brotherhood of mutants on their differences on how to deal with humans. But, in a prequel, the story can be altered; which is conveniently explained as a 'reboot'. The film introduces us to young Erik Lenhsherr who loses his parents during the holocaust. The rage triggers his mutant powers of magnetism which the Nazis seek to tame. Cut to his adulthood, a grown up Erik (Michael Fassbender) seeks revenge. Simultaneously, we are shown Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy) opulent childhood, his gift for mind-control and growing up with Raven/ Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).Set in the 60's during the Cuban missile crisis, it involves a fictional plot with Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who is keen to trigger World War III and usher in a mutant rule. We are shown that Shaw was formerly the German official who spotted Erik's powers and is a mutant supervillian. The CIA seeks Xavier's help to tackle Shwaw. Erik and Xavier's paths converge as they join hands to thwart Shaw. In a way, the story belongs to Magneto. He's not shown to be a villain but someone who carries scars of the holocaust which, in a way, has desensitized him from connecting with humans. Fassbender's lone-wolf portrayal, Machiavellian approach, styling and a Cold War backdrop bear an uncanny resemblance to James Bond flicks. Needless to say, he's done exceedingly well to carry off his role.James McAvoy is credible as the mentor to his creed and also helping Erik harness his powers sans rage. Curiously, barring Xavier's British accent, none of the others, especially Erik & Shaw seem to speak with an accent reflecting their ancestry. Other characters like Raven, Emma Frost or Hank had the potential but weren't emphasized. As much as the story took its liberties, the end couldn't have been anything else. Magneto had to turn against humans and Xavier had to end up in a wheelchair. The problem is that the ending looks rushed and hardly spends much time on the 'why' of things, and that too parting ways when their mentor, Xavier was badly hit.First Class also differs from its predecessors since it doesn't rely excessively on special effects or high octane thrills associated with this genre. Still, it has people flying, disappearing, a bit of fire, ships and people levitated, etc., all without a minute being wasted. It offers enough to satiate action-hungry fans. In all, it's a worthwhile watch.","

"X-Men: First Class","scottshak_111","15 June 2011","Matthew, the mighty, Vaughn. I've seen all four of his movies and I must say he has never disappointed me so far. Layer Cake is still the most mind-boggling movie of all times. I can't get rid of Stardust from my mind and Kick-ass is the finest flick I've ever come across and my collection still retains it(Waiting for the sequel Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall, keeping my fingers crossed for that). Matthew Vaughn was definitely the guy I'd go for, that was the first reason why I wanted to go watch the flick.Actually, there were a couple of more reasons why I wanted to see this movie real bad.James McAvoy, reason no.2, with awesome movies like Wanted and Atonement to his name, 'him in the boots of Charles' - I was a bit inquisitive.Reason no. 3 - Magneto, My favourite character in the X-men saga (with Cyclops sharing the same position in the list) I was not sure whether Michael Fassbender was the right person for it(But you know what? He was impeccable as Erik.) Reason no. 4 - The awesome trailer and the trailer's music. I couldn't help humming the music every now and then.Reason no. 5 - Kurt's(Nightcrawler's) father Azazel, I was looking forward for this guy because Marvel Comics had manifested him as one of the most powerful mutant(tel-e-porting in a different dimension even in the Mutant Chronicles is no joke, Right?) Although they modify the story every now and then (Geez !!! what about the part where Mystique falls in love with Azazel in Germany and conceives Nightcrawler?)Reason no. 6 - The Oscar nominated actress Jennifer Lawrence(for Winter's Bone) had bagged the role for Raven? ""CURIOUS""...........!!!Reason no. 7 - Rose Byrne, I am watching her movies ever since I saw her in Troy and Wicker Park. Was looking forward to watch her as the famous Moira MacTaggert.Reason no. 8 - Kevin Bacon, Although the trailer 'hardly' showed him hither and thither, I was looking forward for his role as Shaw and guess what he proved to be the finest of all! Reason no. 8 - A big fan of Marvel Comics and the X-men saga. So no questions there.Some great acting by the entire crew with the HellFire Club's lead Kevin Bacon as Shaw, Riptide(he never spoke, dumb-ass! What up), Jason Flemyng as Azazel(now that's called skillful), January Jones as Emma Frost and of course the X team as well with Nicholas Hoult as Beast, James McAvoy as Charles, Fassbender as Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique etc. The movie was kick-ass and worth watching. The screenplay was brilliant. Vaughn, no words to express his direction and Kevin Bacon along with Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy stole the show.","

"X-Men: First Class","tyreeewebster","25 June 2011","Out of all of Marvel Studios' films, the 'X- MEN' franchise is one of my favourites. This is because of the great special effects, explosive action scenes, hot babes and the frequent comedic moments. When I heard that a prequel to the series was going to be made, my brother and I were really excited because we knew that it was going to be super AWESOME! And it was. But let's face it, the movie did have it's flaws, it being the lame writing or the not- as good as X Men 3- special effects, even my favourite mutant, BEAST had his flaws, but I'll get to him later.PROS: The great parts about this movie was the near- perfect casting. James McCavoy is great as always as the awesome Professor X, as he showed us a side of the character we have never seen before! He was charming, cool and very courageous! Michael Fassbender was also good as Erik Lensherr (MAGNETO) and we also get to see how he became the menacing Magneto in the later movies. It's just his accent that jerked me off. Other than that, he did a good job. Other actors that were good were January Jones as EMMA FROST and Kevin Bacon as SEBASTIAN SHAW, he was a cool, likable yet believable villain. The writing was great, I loved the idea of including the clip about young MAGNETO from 'X MEN' in the beginning of the movie. The direction was very awesome, with the director being Matthew Vaughn.CONS: I'm going to keep this part as short as possible because I don't want you to be turned off by the negative aspects and focus more on the positive. I guess my biggest flaw for this film, in my opinion, is the video game-like special effects. I don't know what it is, it's just that it didn't look as cool as the previous films, it was just too noticeable that it was CGI. Like I said at the beginning, the dialogue was a bit crappy, for example, at the end of the movie when MAGNETO is called by his real name and says 'Actually, I prefer... Magneto!', which my friend then turned to 'Actually, I prefer... Potato!' The make-up for BEAST kind of sucked, but it was still very well done.Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends, so if you're walking into the cinema, hoping to see something like 'THE KING'S SPEECH'. Then you'll be disappointed. But see it anyway... it's the X MEN! See the movie! 9/10","

"X-Men: First Class","ayoreinf","14 June 2011","The X-Men are my favorite comic. The closest sci-fi comics ever got to real science fiction. Un like most comics its characters are far from cartoons, they're 3D characters - so no wonder they didn't need to add the special effect. The movie was true to these aspects of the comic, it even kept some of the original story, I wish it was even closer, but understand the wish to tell the story differently so I'm pleased with the fact that the concept remained the same. Using a real historic event as the backdrop to the story is also a good addition. And above all the actors all give their share to the final outcome. Kevin Bacon is superb, Michael Fassbender also excels. But as I said they all do well, and once you believe the characters and the story is good, what else is there to ask.To sum it all: keeping the tradition of good X-man renditions in-fact it's better than the last of the original trio (didn't see Wolverine yet). So if you like the comic - go see it, if you like good thought provoking sci-fi go see it too, if you're none of the above you probably won't be reading this at all so that's it.","

"X-Men: First Class","theycallmemrglass","22 June 2011","Did the X-men film makers name this entry, First Class because of its quality? That was a bit arrogant of them to do that, isn't it? Well sorry, I think its inappropriate, it should be called X-Men: F**CKING AWESOME! What a movie. As far as prequels go, this is the greatest ( I'm not counting Godfather 2, that was half prequel). This is the only prequel movie of any series or franchise that is better than its originals. This film simply got it right in nearly every area. Mainly and crucially it got it right in the motivation, friendship/enemy developments of the main protagonists, Charles and Erik. The character that truly stands out is Erik/Magneto played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender, an ultra cool, dangerous, yet lost soul enraptured with inner hatred and turmoil. Whenever he gets into action or at an emotional high, he carries the most exciting and thrilling piece of aura about him complemented with a pulsating piece of soundtrack! Soundtracks generally should be subtle to drive a story but here, an exception can be made, as it enhanced an already bad-ass character into something I would disturbingly worship. Charles's journey was also done extremely well (played with incredible zest by James McAvory), as we see him shake off his young slightly womanising immaturity (which was fun to watch) ready to take on a huge responsibility for his own kind and to pursue his belief that there can be harmony between mutants and humans, an ideology that is in complete contrast to his friend Erik's who believes in the survival of his own kind, at any cost. Survival of the fittest. But no film can be truly great without a great villain. That box was ticked by Kevin Bacon's evil evil Nazi general and...boy is he evil and so damn COOL. I think I need help, I am being overdosed with evil coolness.Its the character drives, motivations, and relationships that truly elevates this superhero film above most others. The pacing was exquisite and energetic. The tone was deliciously vibrant due to its 1960s backdrop. The actors were superb, all of them. Aside from Charles and Erik, Raven/Mystique journey was truly moving. Other characters also had enough attention for us to be interested in their fates. Actors will only perform their best when there is good direction so kudos to a fantastic job by director Matthew Vaughan. The story itself was clever and intriguing, integrating the well known Cuban crisis history with the fictitious mutant evolution.I admit continuity with previous X-Men films is not tight, it is a bit loose despite obvious references to the previous X-men movies. But I would say it has better continuity than the Star Wars prequels.There was just so much joy to be had in this film that I feel rather overwhelmed by it as I was not expecting a superhero movie with this kind character depth. Only Nolan's Batman movies retain that crown but this is a different universe, colourful, vibrant, intelligent and truly entertaining.","

"X-Men: First Class","tavm","3 June 2011","Having previously seen the three X-Men films not to mention read the comics during the Chris Claremont '80s, I had a big interest in seeing this depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded by one Charles Xavier. That said, the real exciting action doesn't go into high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling drama concerning the main characters of the later known Professor X (James McAvoy) and his initial friend-turned-nemesis Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They along with Kevin Bacon as someone Magneto wants vengeance against-Sebastian Shaw-make the film truly worth seeing and brings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a direction that I'm not sure of. Having said that, the director Matthew Vaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters don't get too much short shrift so on that note, X-Men: First Class comes highly recommended.","

"X-Men: First Class","zardoz-13","20 June 2011","""X-Men: First Class"" is an first class ""X-Men"" movie.""Kiss Ass"" director Matthew Vaughn and scenarists Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman have done a marvelous job depicting the back story to the first ""X-Men"" movie. Furthermore, they have done something ingenious by using Cuban Missile Crisis as part of the story. As Sebastian Shaow, Kevin Bacon makes a superb villain who rarely delivers a threat he doesn't carry out. In his first scene with a young Erik, he threatens to shoot Erik's mom at the Nazi concentration camp if Erik doesn't move a coin on his desk. When Erik cannot summon sufficient power to move the coin a millimeter, Sebastian Shaw shoots her stone cold dead without a qualm. Shaw's cold-blooded murder of Erik's mom triggers a rage in him, and he crunches a small metal ringer bell, some filing cabinets, and then the helmets of the two German soldiers holding his mom. Later, when a high American ranking officer threatens to commit suicide and take Shaw with him, Shaw snatches the hand grenade away from Colonel Hendry and pulls the pin. We watch as he absorbs the explosion before Hendry's eyes. Bacon's villainy knows no bounds. Later, James McAvoy appears as Charles Xavier before he receives his title as a university professor, and Michael Fassbender is the adult form of Erik Lensherr. Erik is in hot pursuit of Shaw. He travels to Argentina to track down Shaw, but he finds only two of his associates in a bar. One says he is a pig farmer and the other is a tailor. Erik disposes of both of them in a slick showdown, stabbing the pig farmer in the hand twice. In one terrific scene, when he finds Shaw aboard his yacht, he uses the anchor of Shaw's yacht to destroy the yacht. The first scene in the Nazi camp bears an amazing resemblance to the scene in director Bryan Singer's original ""X-Men."" After that creepy scene, director Mathew Vaughn stages the eventful scene in his office with Erik when he guns down his mother. As he leaves Erik alone, he presses the coin into his palm that he had asked Erik to move. Vaughn and his writers show us Charles Xavier at an early age when he encounter Raven for the first time. She is in his kitchen after dark attempting to steal food when he walks in on her with a baseball bat. He exposes her for a fraud because she is masquerading as his late mother. The confrontation concludes with blows as Charles and Raven become life-long friends. Eventually, the C.I.A. recognizes the presence of mutants when Xavier reads their minds and Raven performs her shape-shifting tricks before their eyes. Meantime, Erik has grown up, and he is searching for Shaw. This time he doesn't have as much luck with his adversaries as he had earlier with a Swiss banker and two Nazis hiding out in Argentina. Shaw and his two mutant friends evict him from their yacht. At the same time, CIA Agent Moria MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) has been on the trail of Shaw. Since she cannot convince her superiors that mutants exist, she invites a recently graduated Xavier to CIA Headquarters with Raven alongside to advise them about the reality of mutants. Naturally, Moria's CIA superiors aren't impressed. Nevertheless, Moria and Charles pursue Shaw.The showdown during the Cuban Missile Crisis is skillfully orchestrated and watching Magneto levitate a submarine out of the Gulf of Mexico is impressive.Hugh Jackman's profane cameo as Wolverine makes the movie and seals its continuity with the other ""X-Men"" epics.","

"X-Men: First Class","bellino-angelo2014","7 January 2023","I nearly loved the original X MEN trilogy and also the rebooted one with the new cast. Since I had the chance of re-watching this a week before Christmas, I can finally review it but considering there are already 835 reviews to date I won't be that long.When the film begins Erik Lensheer (Michael Fassbender) is taken along with his mom to Sebastain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) to a facility and Shaw tests Erik's ability of morphin metal, but when Erik fails Sebastian makes his henchmen execute his mother and when Erik grows up he meets Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and with the help of Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) and some others form the X Men and Erik will manage to avenge his mother and stop Shaw and his diabolical plan.The cast was great. Fassbender and McAvoy are great as the younger versions of the characters previously portrayed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, and while I love Rebecca Romijn as Mystique, Jennifer Lawrence is good as well. The supporting cast is full of many beloved faces (Hoult, Matt Craven, Michael Ironside, Oliver Platt, James Remar, Glenn Morshower and even Hugh Jackman in a cameo) and Kevin Bacon is pitch-perfect as the villain. There are various funny moments but instead of explaining them here, it's best that you see the movie for yourselves.Overall, a great prequel and a superhero movie that is also lot of fun, and that is the most important thing.","

"X-Men: First Class","classicsoncall","9 October 2011","I don't have the emotional investment in the Marvel Universe that a lot of comic book fans do, I grew up preferring the DC super-heroes. What I know about the X-Men comes from the infrequent casual read along with my exposure to other films in the franchise. As an outsider looking in, I thought this was a blast of a story showcasing the origins of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), and the rest of the early X-Men characters. I particularly enjoyed the setting of the story in 1962, using the Cuban Missile Crisis as the backdrop for the confrontation between Xavier's team and that of Klaus Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). That dynamic was skillfully used to explain the eventual break between Xavier and Lensherr, with Professor X attempting to work alongside humans, while Magneto would come to realize that that could never be the case.That's not to say the story didn't have it's problems. For example, when Klaus Schmidt killed young Erik's mother, why didn't Erik simply finish the job of annihilating the German right then and there in the maelstrom he created? I fully expected that to happen, even while knowing that it couldn't for the sake of the story line. That could have been handled better than it was.And my biggest disappointment - no Stan Lee! I don't know what happened there, but why break the precedent established with all the other Marvel franchise films? If someone thought that was a good idea, it should be apparent by now that it wasn't. Fortunately, the Hugh Jackman cameo as Wolverine partially assuaged my feelings about the Lee exclusion. Overall, I thought this was an intriguing story with a lot of cool elements and special effects. If all super-hero films could capture this level of character development and excitement, it would make the wait for the next one that more satisfying.","

"X-Men: First Class","Tweekums","23 September 2015","This prequel shows us the origins of the X-Men. It opens in the same place as the original film as Erik Lensherr, a young boy in a Nazi concentration camp, is separated from his mother and somehow bends the metal gates with his mind. This is witnessed by scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt who decides to research the boy's powers. Across the Atlantic another meeting is taking place; young telepath Charles Xavier finds a shapeshifter, named Raven, stealing food from his kitchen; rather than alerting anybody he is happy to meet somebody else with powers and befriends her.The action then moves forward to 1962 and Erik is searching for Schmidt while Xavier is receiving his doctorate in Oxford. Schmidt, now calling himself Sebastian Shaw, is trying to engineer a war between the United States and the Soviet Union with the help of three mutants. One of his meetings is witnessed by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert; her report about mutants is disregarded and she sets about finding an expert in the field Xavier. Once on board he sets about finding and recruiting other mutants, including Erik, to stop Shaw. It emerges that Shaw is also a mutant who believes that non-mutant humans must be eliminated. Once Xavier has found a group of young mutants he sets about helping them get the best of their abilities will it be enough to stop Shaw and prevent a nuclear war?I must admit when I started watching this I wasn't expecting anything special as prequels often fail to live up to the original films; largely because we know that main characters must survive thankfully I was wrong. While we knew certain characters would survive that didn't weaken the story; there were plenty we didn't know about and what we learn about the early lives of familiar characters is interesting. The cast does a great job with Michael Fassbender being particularly effective as Erik the troubled man destined to become Magneto, James McAvoy does a fine job as Xavier and Jennifer Lawrence delightfully portrays Raven as she comes to terms with her differences and becomes Mystique. The story is exciting and nicely incorporates real life events, namely the Cuban missile crisis. The special effects are top notch making the impossible look believable. Overall a fine origins story that fans of the original and people new to the franchise can enjoy.","

"X-Men: First Class","dacifu","10 June 2011","8.2 out of 10?...seriously? the first x men was OK...the second was bad...the third was a bag full of puke...wolverine origins was a rape....but this one is worst than any of the other x men movies.What's wrong with this pile of garbage? 1- Professor X and Mystique are related? WTF 2-Alex Summers and not Scott? Why? Scott Summers is one of the original X Men, not Alex 3-Where is Angel? I mean Warren Kenneth Worthington III not that little butterfly girl.4- Where is Iceman? 5- Where is Marvel Girl? What a silly plot. Hollywood can't make good movies anymore. They take a good source and just violated the fans with some stupid adaptation.What's with the romantic relation between Beast and Mystique? Where that came from? Mystique mated with Azazel and that's where Nightcrawler comes from.Stupid movie. I have no idea why the rating is so high.The Wolverine cameo was kind of cool though.","

"X-Men: First Class","gigan-92","4 July 2011","I honestly underestimated this movie, But I can say now I was no less than stunned. And how my doubt would have been lessened all the sooner had I known Matthew Vaughn was directing. Yes, under his direction we don't get a Brett Ratner purely action driven mainstream flick, or a Gavin Hood cliché fest. The amazing thing is that this is a prequel/reboot so the vast majority of the audiences have an idea of what's going to happen.The brilliant thing is the screen play still packs quite a bit of surprises into it all. The story is highly involving and best of all the characters portrayed here are interesting and the actors playing them talented. Jennifer Lawrence is a very good Mystique, and James McAvoy I knew from the start wouldn't fail me. Michael Fassbender was perfect as a young Magneto, putting so much emotion into the villain every second of his screen time astounded me. Emma Frost is given much more screen time this time around, and is a lot better portrayed by January Jones. Beast was awesome, damn it, the characters all get their moment of awesomeness. I can't possibly go over all of them in this review without dragging it on. I can only add that Kevin Bacon was quite the antagonists and Zoë Isabella Kravitz was a very luscious Angel.And the score by Henry Jackman was undeniably awesome. It has a modern feeling to it yet so packed with emotion and sharpening each moment. Definitely see this one because it takes a giant sh*t on the likes of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and "" X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".","

"X-Men: First Class","lao4950000","19 June 2011","This latest film to join the X-Men franchise injects new life and vigor into the saga. It is as much of a prequel as it is a reboot. From a strictly time-line point-of-view it is a prequel, being set in the early 1960s during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But from a storyline point-of-view, it is very much a reboot, with a whole new younger cast along with whole new interesting stories and relationships to involve them in.The film goes all the way back to the beginning in 1944, in Nazi occupied Poland. Here, we are introduced to young Erik Lensherr. Erik is forced to watch his mother be shot right in front of him by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). The uncontrollable rage Erik then feels unleashes his powers and he then goes on to trash every metal object in the room. However, he is unable to focus and use his powers against Shaw, and so the main plot of the film becomes Erik's quest for vengeance.In contrast with Erik's tragic childhood, we see the wealthy opulent lifestyle that Charles Xavier enjoyed. In this film, he meets young Mystique, and quickly adopts her as his younger sister.Cut to 1962 where the rest of the film takes place. Adult Erik, played excellently by Michael Fassbender continues on his quest for revenge against Shaw. In this film, he has not yet become Magneto. He is not the villain, in fact he is a character we all sympathize with. Inside he is still the traumatized boy who watched his mother get killed right in front of him. What I love about X-Men First Class is that it finally adds layers to Magneto's character, he isn't just a one-dimensional cartoon villain.And James McAvoy breathes new life as young adult Charles. Here, the young Professor X is a dashing English gentleman who uses witty pick-up lines on pretty college girls and chugs whole pints of beer. His expertise on mutations is what leads to his recruitment to the CIA by Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). And it is through the CIA that brings Charles and Erik's paths together.McAvoy and Fassbender have amazing on screen chemistry together, and this is clearly reflected in Charles and Erik's fast developing friendship. These two men are not just friends, they really see themselves as brothers. The casting for both Charles and Erik could not have been more perfect, you can definitely see how even decades later Professor X and Magneto stay lifelong friends even if they have opposite philosophies.The other relationship that must be mentioned is the romance between young Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Their short-lived relationship is tragic yet poignant. It falls victim to self-hatred and the struggle for acceptance in a human society that all too often shows absolute cruelty to those who are different...........that is the key message of the X-Men and it is so beautifully played out by these two doomed lovebirds.From watching this film, you actually want Erik and Charles to continue being best friends without any of the tragedy and mutant-against-mutant fighting. But alas, we all know how it all ends, so the ending of film can't show anything different. You finally see how Charles becomes paralyzed, the whole lead-up to that scene is just epically sad yet beautiful at the same time.This was a wonderfully acted project and it also contains just the right amount of action scenes that we all love and demand from an X-Men film. I encourage you all to see it if you haven't already.","

"X-Men: First Class","ironhorse_iv","12 December 2012","This movie is hard to say if it's a prequel or reboot when the movie opening is similar or the same with that of the first X-Men 2000 movie. At first glance, it can be confusing as it looks like the audience is watching that movie. Erik Lesherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbasser) seek for the death of Klaus Schmidt aka Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) for the death of his mother during the Holocaust. It takes him forever to find the right time to kill him and the movie fails to connect the dots between what happen to him from childhood to adulthood. Due to the film absenting much of his past, the audience is to believe through flashbacks that he suffers from harsh experiments by Shaw or that he went to work for him, but deep inside wanted to kill him. What ever happen, 1962 Magneto is now on a hunt for Shaw. Michael Fassbasser is brilliant in the role, as he able to speak Spanish, French, English, & German very clear, unlike Kevin Bacon whom Russian and German doesn't match what's coming out of his mouth. Still Michael's voice spokes different between him speaking a foreign language to that or English. His English is in a higher pitch. Michael is able to act in a sinister matter without speaking, and able to portray a man in rage. Magneto soon become a good friend with Charles Xavier aka Professor X (James McAvoy) on his quest when Xavier save his life. McAvoy was able to portray a new light of Charles as a smart young sexed up, self-serving man while having the selfless, egoless good for mankind ideas. Sooner than later, these two men would end up being enemies as both men have different views of life and revenge. Professor X is against murder despite him trying to kill a character later on the film, and him knowing Magneto kill people in the past. There wasn't a hero to really follow and get behind. Fans are not supposed to firmly get behind Professor X or Magneto as they are supposed to see both of their points of view and be a little conflicted. Then with shape-shifter Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Mystique was never a good person; she was always a manipulative borderline sociopathic monster. But in this one she was one of the good guys despite she was friends with Charles since childhood but totally abandons him paralyzed. Jennifer Lawrence just seems awkward in the role, due to the make-up and CGI being not that good. In some scenes where she changing her form; the body and face doesn't match. She willing to hit on the male leads, as well as supporting character Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast. The actor looks awkward in the Beast form. The Beast's make up and suit was just not menacing enough. It needed more build to it to make Beast look strong. Charles and Eric go off to find other mutants to join their team against Shaw and his group whom trying to start World War 3 between Russia and USA using real life events such as Cuba Missile Crisis. They got CIA officer MacTaggert, Banshee, Darwin, Havok and nearly got Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Wolverine would only have the only curse word in the movie. Having Wolverine introduced in the film was to bring the comic fans and fans of the previous films to see the movie, but having Darwin introduced just to be used to be killed off. As for most of the other characters they were only present so the film could demonstrate various powers using today's special effects. Banshee, Havok, etc were nothing but cardboard cutouts. They had no character development what so ever, they were there simply to look cool. Shaw's group made out of Riptide, Angel, Azazel continues to create chaos while Shaw's strongest member Emma Frost (January Jones) put the final touches to the plan, getting the Russians to move their missiles to Cuba. January Jones's Emma Frost isn't much of a character, but more like eye candy. She wears skimpy to no clothes during the film. She gives nothing to the role, like Kevin Bacon gives nearly nothing new to Sebastian Shaw, but the 1960's look to the character. The 1960s setting of X-Men: First Class had that James Bond look. The scene in the bar in Argentina can pretty much look and acts like Michael Fassbender pitch perfect as badass, charming, ruthless and sweet Sean Connery's style personality while having that tense moment western shootout. They did a cool job representing the period like showing old Las Vegas, and the way the character dress in a way it still felt muscular and action-oriented as if reading the 1960's comic book. The X-Men yellow and blue costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while looking space age for the action scenes. The action scenes were great in the film. Most of the visual and special effects work out. Henry Jackman composed score worked for the film as it goes into a heroic epic super hero theme to disjointed disturbing beat when Magneto does something bad. The film does an OK version of paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast, but it does go wrong with the lore of the story to the point it's beyond fixable. Writers do whatever they want with the characters and their origins and powers and such that the movies don't follow each other. It doesn't even follow the first team of X-men from the book, but if comic books fans are able to turn their mind off and just watch it as a stand alone film. It's watchable. The film has to be an alternate history for the X-Men to work. It stilled a better film, then the previous films like X-Men 3 & Origins.","

"X-Men: First Class","leplatypus","28 July 2014","So, i have watched « XMEN: DOFP » the morning in theater and i was lucky to watch this one on TV the evening after. For me, none of them is better as the two aren't truly « comics adaptation » but rather pale inspirations. Both used name of characters, certain famous moments of X-men history (especially uncanny #150) and then, they cook their own soup. Here, the Hellfire Club becomes a sort of Specter or fit for for « Austin Powers » and the X-Men get tangled in international crisis. This first class has rather boring teammates (Havok, Banshee, Mystique, ""angel Salvadore""?,""Darwin""?, ""Riptide""?). If the sets are however visually stunning, the power of this movie is to have found an incredible young Magnus with Fassbender. As Ridely Scott has noticed in « Prometheus », this actor is just great as he really acts old school!","

"X-Men: First Class","MarcusJ13","14 June 2011","When the words prequel and reboot are mentioned about the same film I get a little sceptical. I loved the X-Men series and so wanted this to be good. Gladly, this was a welcome addition and an example of a prequel that works brilliantly on many levels but also takes a few liberties in some areas. If you are very aware of the past X-Men films there are a few things that differ with the continuity that you'll be aware of. At first I was irritated by this but I realised that it it simply what happens when some prequels like this film are made. If this sort of thing does irritate you be aware of this and you may end up enjoying it after all. I sound cagey in this respect but I do want to keep this review spoiler free. Just be aware of this as there is special effort made for this film to show its individuality in many respects. The performances were all good and some very good, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw occasionally came across as goofy for a villain but showed his worth when he needed to be threatening especially once the third act came along. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender did very well together and had a brilliant rapport. I thought it would have been difficult to replicate this given the chemistry that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen had in the X-Men trilogy. They did very well together and I really believed their friendship, that is not to mention they do well in scenes when they are not together as well. The other mutants started out fairly same old same old but came into their own at the end. Although despite their somewhat weak introductions as characters I did find myself caring about then once that climax came along. There were scenes with plenty of tension especially involving Erik/Magneto that had a great deal to do with Fassbender's performance. The action involved was consistently good and also wasn't a constant in the film where the focus was very much on the characters and it also made me appreciate the action more when it came. The action got better as the film went on and there was a genuine effort by the film makers to make a film that could be both exciting in terms of action and make it a brilliant character story. In summary if you enjoyed the previous X-Men films you should enjoy this one as it really makes an effort and the performances while not especially brilliant from the supporting characters were fantastic from the leads. These performances made me want to see McAvoy and Fassbender in these roles again. It features an amusing cameo as well.","

"X-Men: First Class","gritfrombray-1","13 June 2011","I tend to approach prequels with caution. Caprica is seriously lacking as are many others. Without dragging things out, this film has a first rate cast and engaging storyline. Something I believe the other X Men films lacked. They were all good films with amazing actors, the third film being a bit weak but they were all character stuff and wafer thin story lines. This has plots, ideas and many gap fillers of Mutants' introduction into society and provides a wonderful sub plot staged around a very significant part of American history. The script, action and characters are all excellent and so many idiots are watching this on download or computer screens. Do so at your own peril as this is one for the big screen. Restored a lot of faith in Marvel movies.... Oh, and I have a whole new respect for Kevin Bacon after seeing this!!","

"X-Men: First Class","jboothmillard","22 June 2011","The Marvel X-Men franchise has really grown since the first film, three original films, a prequel for Wolverine, and now this prequel seeing possibly the two most significant characters and how and why they became what they did, from director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass). Basically the film opens in 1944 with twelve year old Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) meeting ten year old Raven (Morgan Lily) and being happy to find someone else ""different"", because he is a telepathic, and she has the ability of shape-shifting into other people. We also see young Erik Lehnsherr (Bill Milner) in the Nazi concentration camps forced by scientist Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) to show his ability, of course it only comes out with rage, seeing his mother shot to death for example, he can bend and lift all metals. Nearly twenty years pass, Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has graduated and published a thesis on mutation, and Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who keeps her true form hidden, is living with him as his adoptive sister. Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meanwhile has perfected his metal based power, and he wants revenge for the death of his parents, by of course killing Schmidt, real name Sebastian Shaw, who has an ability himself, to absorb energy and use it as defence. After witnessing a plot by Shaw to have a Colonel's identity stolen in order to have missiles made ready to attack, Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Insidious's Rose Byrne) needs Xavier with his theories and knowledge of mutation to convince the CIA that mutants exist, and that Shaw is a threat. While sponsored by the unnamed Man In Black Suit (Eraser's Oliver Platt), they manage to track the threatening man down, and just in time to stop Erik from killing both the terrorist inside the submarine, as well as himself. Entering the CIA secret ""Division X"" facility, they meet another mutant Hank McCoy (Skins' Nicholas Hoult), who has hands for feet, and has created Cerebro, the device that used by Charles can track all mutants of the world, so they can recruit them. Along the way they find and train Angel Salvadore aka Wings (Zoë Kravitz, Lenny's daughter) who sprouts angel like wings, Armando Muñoz aka Darwin (Edi Gathegi) who adapts to an environment, e.g. gaining gills to breathe underwater, Alex Summers aka Havok (Lucas Till) who can emit cosmic energy waves to attack, and Sean Cassidy aka Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) who has powerful vocal cords causing waves of sound, that can help him fly and attack. While Charles and Erik meet Emma Frost (American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones), the rest of the mutants as the secret facility are found by Shaw, along with his gang of mutant villains, including Azazel (Jason Flemyng) who can create streams of paralysing and destructive energy and also teleport, and Janos Quested aka Riptide (Álex González), and he wants to recruit them to other side, he manages to get Angel, and Darwin is killed. After the facility has been destroyed, Charles takes the remaining mutants to be trained at his family mansion where they all perfect their powers, Hank created a formula he thought would get rid of the mutant gene, but for him it only made it increase and he turns blue to become Beast, and they all get protective uniforms. While the Cuban Missile Crisis is going on with the involvement of President John F. Kennedy, Shaw is wearing a protective helmet that stops Charles being able to connect to his mind, and he does everything he can to cause World War III. The mutant heroes fight off the villains with their perfected abilities, and against the wishes of Charles, Erik fulfils his desire to kill Shaw, and taking the telepathy blocking helmet with him, and he unintentionally gets Moira to shoot Charles in the spine. The end of the film sees Erik leaving with his new cohorts Mystique, Angel, Riptide and Azazel, Moira promises Charles, who is bound in a wheelchair, not to reveal his desire to open a school for mutants, but he erases her memory to make sure, and finally Magneto breaks out Emma Frost. Also starring Hugh Jackman as a brief Logan aka Wolverine, Rebecca Romijn as a brief older Raven aka Mystique, Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Captain and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Soviet Captain. McAvoy makes a superb young Professor X, Fassbender may not be bothering with an English accent like Sir Ian McKellen but is just as terrific, Bacon is indeed a fantastic villain (I didn't even know he was starring), I will say it does start a little slow, but once half an hour or so has passed you are definitely hooked by the great performances, the action packed fight scenes and of course the amazing special effects to take you to this extraordinary alternative universe, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. Very good!","

"X-Men: First Class","kunalkhandwala","13 June 2011","X-Men: First Class is exactly what every super hero franchise should have; a back-story about the origins of protagonists that builds their moral character for future iterations. Director Michael Vaughn introduces us to young Charles Xavier, whose telepathic abilities would make him a leader of the X-Men in the future and Eric, whose tragic loss in childhood would make him harness his magnetic abilities to overpower greater forces. Their friendship that brought the First Class of mutants together, would eventually see them parting ways to either moral end. The stylized action and class we saw in Vaughn's impressive 'Kick-Ass' is replicated here in a James Bond like epic, set during the cold war with super heroes who save the day.Kevin Bacon plays the doomsday villain, Sebastian Shaw, whose abilities can harness any energy around him. With the cold war at its highest tension point, he plans nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis. Meanwhile, the young Charles has grown up (James McAvoy) with Raven, aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose mutant abilities can take on any human's appearance and together, they discover fellow mutants with some help from the CIA. Erik's (Michael Fassbender) vengeful pursuit of Shaw brings him in alliance with Charles as they recruit mutants into their team to save mankind from the threat of annihilation in the Cuban seas. Outstanding performances with the sheer intensity of Michael Fassbender and composed intelligence of James McAvoy delineate the determination and ambition of their younger characters whose friendship will be forced to the other ends of morality when they grow into Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto.Even though in shorter roles, Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and Rose Byrne are impressive. For a super hero movie, the acting is indeed First Class. Not to forget, the visual treat of January Jones as Emma Frost.Vaughn consistently builds the dramatic tension with the situations between USA and Russia, Shaw and Charles, and finally, between Charles and Erik. The backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and Shaw's doomsday plan remind us of the Mr.Bond but with the X-Men as heroes, Vaughn brings a truly unique dimension to good v/s evil. The special effects as the mutants test their powers, are dazzling.The sequences involving Magneto lifting the submarine and then stopping a barrage of missiles are jaw dropping.Vaughn leaves no stone unturned in unleashing action that is visually striking while some exemplary acting keeps one engaged in an intriguing plot. X-Men:First Class is not only a system reboot but it also sets certain standards for super hero films especially this season. Seldom has it been so much fun in going into to the past of our favorite characters and relating every incident and event with who and what they become. Not since the transition of Darth Vader himself, has it even been so pleasing to see a villain proclaiming himself as Magneto did. The lines of morality are blurry and one cannot take sides too easily in the formation of the X-Men and while being entertained, one can clearly sense the feeling of fulfillment in an almost flawless story that you wouldn't want to see the end of. This is truly, a First Class adventure you don't want to miss....8.521 on a scale of 1-10.","

"X-Men: First Class","NJRocker091188","14 June 2011","First,I'd just like to say for those of you whom hated this film,there is something you need to keep in mind.And that is, that this film isn't just a prequel.It is also in a way a reboot. It is as if we are forgetting the disappointment of X3, as if it didn't happen. It is like the only movies that came out where X-Men and X2.If you where to actually pay attention, and look back, you would note that this movie starts of just as the first one did. Clearly indicating, that the director, as well as writers made this film in a way to be a remake. Therefore, this is not just a prequel, it is a reboot.And obviously, with Professor X ending up wheelchair bond at the end, it also shows that we are in fact starting over.A side from that, this film is in fact excellent.I cannot say that this film is not at all flawed. But, at the same time, I do not see a reason to not declare it as excellent.With excellent performances from James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender. As well as a great script, and store line. I am not trying to state that the rest of the cast did not give a excellent performance, but James and Micheal where truly excellent.Other then performance from the actors/ and actresses, and the nicely written script/ story line, there are other things that I liked about this movie. I liked how as the viewer, I finally got to see Professor X and what he is like just as Charles Xavier. You get to see him as more then just a mutant with mind powers. We get to explore a little bit of what he is like as a young man in his 20's. You also get to see him as he shows off his mind power. It was also talked about in the first two films, but never really shown.And then there is Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto . We get to understand a little bit more about his past, and why he became the villain that we know him as. Exploring his past as Erik, and seeing him and his power develop.The next person we get to learn a little bit about is Raven / Mystique. In stead of just seeing her as a blue bad ass, you actually get to learn about her as Raven. We get to see both her sides. I also knew there was a lot more to her then just being a bitch, but, it was never really told. And, we get to learn about her relationship with Erik.Now, I am not going to get into detail about ever character. But, the point is, if you never read the comics, or you did, but didn't read them all. Either way, you get to learn a little bit about some of your favorite characters. This film unlocks some information that wasn't giving to us before in previous films.And another thing about this film that I really liked was that he got to see Professor X as a teacher. It was talked about how he was a great teacher but, again, it was never really explored. So, in this film, you actually get into some detail.And last but, not least, I really liked the whole war setting. I thought that made for a great plot line.So, as the viewer, you get some great special effects, some excellent performances, a excellent script/story, a long with some detail about some favorites, and there past, as well as relationship with each other. And of course, a excellent plot.X-Men: First Class makes for a down right great film, excellent comic book movie, and a excellent summer flick.","

"X-Men: First Class","planktonrules","3 June 2011","I am not a comic book fan. I like films based on the characters but unlike my oldest daughter and many in the audience, I was not looking to see if this movie is exactly like the X-Men comics. So, if you are such a fan, I might not be the best reviewer to read. However, I did notice that this movie pretty much ignored this hard-core audience. Unlike practically every Marvel film for the bast decade or two, there was no cameo by Stan Lee--none. And, unlike the typical Marvel film, Fox chose not to include any special extras scene at the end of this film (though there was a cute cameo with Wolverine part-way through the film). Because of this, I felt bad for the audience, as I saw it at the midnight show on opening night--and could see and hear the hard-core fans' disappointment--in particular because there was no appearance by Lee. According to my insanely devoted daughter, she read Lee's tweets and apparently he was never even asked to do a cameo for ""X-Men: First Class""! Sadly, the film seems only intended for the casual viewer when just a tiny bone would have pleased the fan base.Now as for the film itself, it was great. The script was highly imaginative and managed to incorporate real-life events into the X-Man universe. Little did I realize that the Cuban Missile Crisis was actually instigated by the Xs!! In addition to a dandy script (where, incidentally, it sure looked like there was a love connection brewing between Xavier and Magneto), I liked the acting, action and pace. At well over two hours, I was happy as there were no obvious lags.However, being a natural born complainer, there was one other big thing that bothered me. There was a great black X-Man character but he was handled horribly--and I could see the black audience feeling alienated by some DUMB decisions in the film. First, in one scene, the word ""slave"" is used--and the camera pans directly on the black character! Second, only minutes later, the black guy was DEAD!!!! This is an offensive cliché---and although I am NOT a politically correct nut, it was obvious and ticked me off, as it was totally unnecessary. Could this have been handled better...heck, yeah!! A minor thing that bothered me (I am a retired history teacher) is that many of the characters' hair styles were from 1962 but many were also straight from 2011. Another minor one is the use of songs that didn't yet exist--such as WWII soldiers listening to Edith Piaf's ""La Via En Rose""--a song that came out in 1946--a year after the war. These were a bit sloppy but were minor mistakse. Still, it is a good film--well worth seeing and fun--just a few mistakes short of perfect.","

"X-Men: First Class","ajs-10","1 June 2011","It isn't often I get to see a film on the first day of release, but due to a timely week off work I was able to make it to the first screening at my local cinema. There was no need to rush, the other eight people there were well spread out and I had an entire row (or six) to myself! I guess I should talk about the film that's why you're reading this after all. Really enjoyable with quite a complicated plot but I found that despite a running time of over two hours it really flew by! Testament to the writers, actors, director and everyone else involved, it's a big thumbs up from me.We are told the story of how Charles Xavier founded his school for mutants in 1963. How he and his best friend, Erik Lehnsherr, later to be known as Magneto, had differing visions for the future for mutants. The stories of Hank McCoy (Beast) and Raven (Mystique), amongst others, are also told, particularly how Raven grew up with Charles but ultimately couldn't see his vision. The narrative is set against the Cuban Missile Crisis, which, for the purposes of this story, is manipulated by one Sebastian Shaw, who has his own reasons for wanting to start a nuclear war. Shaw also has a very strong significance to Erik but I'm not going to tell you about that here (no spoilers here).Great performances all round, particularly from; James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Jennifer Lawrence as Raven / Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast.As we have come to expect from these films, the special effects are of the highest quality. Fortunately this does not distract from the excellent plot that gives so much more depth to the main characters. There is a fair amount of humour as well, look out for a very brief appearance from Wolverine (very funny). Over all, an exceedingly well made film that I hope becomes a big hit. It's intelligent without ever talking down to the audience and I really enjoyed it. I would be happy to see it again and it's already pencilled in to be added to by DVD collection Recommended.My Score 8.5/10","

If you have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows them away completely.I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring. This prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It follows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can't believe the cleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.This is a definite watchable film.Anyway, without boring people - please watch it!

"X-Men: First Class","WallyDee","4 June 2011","Am i the only one who thought this movie was bad and i mean REALLY BAD? Im not the best writer but i just cant resist writing something about this movie.X-Men Origins Wolverine was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen, and i honestly thought that this one was worse! and in my book thats saying a lot!I mean THIS WAS IT!!! This was the big prequel story that started the rivalry between Professor X and Magneto and THIS was the only history they had of being friends!?!? Thats it????? Was THIS the origin story that jump started the war between humans and mutants? Are you serious??Mystique and Professor X are step brother and sister now!?................REALLY????? He tells her she will never have to feel hunger again and gives her a roof over her head and all that when they are still kids, plus they seem to get a long pretty damn good growing up, not arguing or fighting or anything like that (well maybe a little but definitely nothing serious) and then she betrays him that easily!!!! right after he JUST got shot in the spine!!!!!!!!!..............REALLY!!! You don't need to be a bad guy just to be yourself!! Was that the only motivation for Mystique to betray her brother and join Magneto to later become the evil blue bitch that we all know? And if i remember this correctly, wasn't Professor X walking in the beginning of (X men 3 The last Stand) when he and Magneto were visiting Jean Grey when she was still a kid? I believe he was, and he was a lot older then and already completely bald. Come to think of it! Professor X and Magneto were still friends at that age! which makes not knowing their history about their friendship even more enteresting because you can assume that they were friends for a loooong time! And you can only guess whatever could have happened to make them arch enemies of each other.....Do you mean to tell me that Professor X can use Cerebro to track down any mutant on the planet and those were the ones they picked to recruit!!! A stupid butterfly girl, an annoying useless screaming kid, a worthless black guy who adapts to the situation for survival and then dies that easily! Havok or whatever with his stupid laser chest, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Then to top it off we have Butterfly girl chasing Screaming kid spitting on him and that was supposed to be exciting!? that is what they call action!?!? Is that one of the dumb action scenes that I read about that other people are so damn excited over!? That actually entertained you people..............?The special effects in this movie looked like they came straight out of a movie that was made in the 90's. I witnessed some of the worst cgi ever viewing this movie! Every scene that contained cgi actually looked like cgi! Very ugly cgi! For example when Magneto stops the missiles shot at the beach and their just hovering in the air or the entire scene of butterfly girl chasing screaming guy, mystique her transformations looked better in the original X men trilogy, even the big radar a couple of miles away that Magneto uses his powers on to make it move looks fake. THIS IS 2011!!! I believe it has to be possible to make cgi effect that the audience obviously KNOWS about it BEING CGI but actually CANT TELL its cgi, am i right?The more i think about this movie the more flaws come to mind and if i have to write all of them down its gonna take all night!There has to be someone out there who agrees with me and who will put the flaws he noticed in a review or something.Sorry for any misspells, I'm Dutch and my English is far from a hundred percent.","

"X-Men: First Class","nikpathak","14 June 2011","WOW... honestly this one is a genre-defining movie on a level with only some comic based films that have come before it. Though the Dark Knight was a god sent and a true testament to how every adaptation of a once thought ""kid"" genre can make big waves on the big screen – this one is certainly close behind and can be labeled as Batman begins of the X-men series. When you emerge through this wonder – on - screen film after a good 2+ hours, you feel proud to be X–men fan (mutants and proud).. . It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most important focusing heavily on content rather than larger than life conventional super-hero films. Should they hide being a mutant, or should they have mutant pride? This question has been the foundation of nearly all of the X-Men films, so this may not be new territory, but the examination of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto, is what this movie is truly aboutThere are plenty of kick-ass action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Painstakingly establishing these characters and the entire universe webbed around the real life events of World War is done remarkably well to intricately weave the context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's. A lot of the time prequels to films can be pretty pointless, since you basically know how it's all going to turn out, but this film is that rare kind of prequel that actually succeeds despite us knowing where it's all going to lead to in the long run. The first thirty minutes jet all the way from Oxford, England, to Vegas, to Switzerland, to Argentina, Germany, and Rochester, New York. There are tons of building blocks that are laid in the first half, but the movie makes the transition from the foundation rocks to a suave tower, smooth and natural, a feat that is hard to explain in words, but makes the difference upon viewing the film.Almost all actors are perfect, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings an excellent charm to Charles Xavier, and Michael Fassbender's Magneto can be compared with Darth wader style anti-hero origins (where the sky-walker character is transformed to a villain not be birth but by circumstance) rather than an downright evil characterization of the character in the other sequels. This could hardly be called a breakout role after the '300' performance, but it sure has elevated his status to lead role material. The other worthy notable younger cast is Jennifer Lawrence as the petite – vulnerable Raven. Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's universe (Dear Director, the painstaking effort of showing vintage cars in a Nevada – Las Vegas set up is noted; bravo !!). Add to it the well-choreographed action sequences (just perfect – the thing which iron man II lacked) that are not over-the board but would adequately satisfy all the sci-fi fans wishing to see this film. The difference though is, while super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature, where the super hero somehow has the super powers and the knowledge to use it, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that even though the characters have the power, they need to learn to channelize it.The best part about what makes this movie a 'stand alone' blockbuster is the fact that a first time viewer of X-men series as well as an ardent fan would be equally entertained (For anyone uneducated about X-Men, First Class is an absorbing introduction. And best of all, it's not jumped on the 3D bandwagon just for the sake of it). However if one subtly divorces oneself from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity; the real class of the movie would stand apart. Can't think of a prequel in recent time which has done a reboot of epic proportions so much; that you actually can bank on fans scrambling back to watch the earlier versions in a quest to calm the urge to have joined the missing blocks mentally.'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience and not just sci-fi fans. With ""X Men: First Class"", Vaughn has infused new life into a franchise that was just looking to be fading with its bland ""Last Stand"" version and ""Wolverine"" spin off. Vaughn's re imagining of the X Men universe is more than robust, especially with an intelligent tightly-plotted script, outstanding lead performances and thrilling action sequences. Vaughn's grittiness of a ""Layer Cake"" and the superhero fun of 'Kick ass' was elevated to a completely new level in this film","

"X-Men: First Class","soul_scion","26 May 2011","I had the good fortune of being invited out to the media preview of this film yesterday in London and as a result, was tres excited, partly because I had a gut feeling that this film, the fourth in the X-Men franchise, would surpass the two predecessors.**SPOILERS ALERT*** Anyhow, launching into the content. Twas good, twas very good and I can't speak for the die hard fans of the series but this will be winner for mainstream audiences for sure - and once more restore the super hero genre somewhat. The action sequences were brilliant without being thrown in there just for the hell of it, the performances by James McAvoy as Charles Xavier was right on point and even Michael Fassbender was intense, tortured (and witty!) as Eric (save for the blatant Irish accent creeping in at the end of the film but that's really minor) Special mention goes to Bill Milner, who plays the young Eric - his scene in the Nazi office - enough said.The film doesn't introduce anything new thematically, as it rotates around the concept of fear and hatred of the new and the misunderstood and questions of what evolution really means – it simply sets up (or rather builds upon, in reverse..?) the two opposing sides that will go on to be represented by Professor X and Magneto. And as most people know, I love going 'back to the start' and revealing what makes characters become who they are. Additionally, the pace carried the film well, considering it was over 2 hours long.The film and the cast are all beautiful to watch, with solid performances from all, though its McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon that do the heavy lifting. The score is intense but in parts I felt like it was doing too much of the work.The script was decent as well and there were only perhaps two lines that were lame in all, so for a super hero movie, that's pretty damn good going.While the mutant characters were engaging enough and felt fully formed, the film painted the rest of humanity as rather dim and grey - I don't fault the movie for that really, it's nigh impossible to show the full spectrum of people but those characters supposedly in power – generals and whatnots, just felt like puppets – but I think that was the point. Talk about ineffective humans – especially those in authority (and doesn't that reflect reality? Ouch!) There were great moments of levity, mostly through Charles Xavier's lines but by far the best sequence was when Eric and Charles team up for the first time and begin recruiting – there's a brilliant inside joke thrown in there that references the original movies – and it had everyone in the cinema laughing.What's more, on a more broad note, the film does keep that question hanging for you – what would you do if you were the more evolved version of the human species? It's a probing enough question but not one that is overbearing to the content or properly explored - which is a wise move, considering all the other movies pick up on that. So you leave feeling you watched a more than decent superhero movie with fair creditability and lots of fun to boot - that surpassed no. 2 and 3 (which isn't hard but if you get stuck in a formula it could go stale and smell bad, like the Star Wars going back to the beginning nonsense. It didn't do that - it got a new lease of life). Plus, if James McAvoy is in it, there's something of worth there, surely? From","

"X-Men: First Class","fciocca","24 November 2021","Last year I watched all the 20+ Avengers movies, so I decided to add the X-MEN franchise to my watchlist, to have a complete picture of the main Marvel narrative universe. ""First Class"" narrates the origin of Professor X and his beloved mutant students. I liked the character progression. I enjoyed the message that this film wants to convey: being able to accept ourselves completely, despite our differences, trying to fit in a society that tends to isolate those who have physical deformities or other peculiarities. The screenwriters literally throw this to the audience, multiple times along the film. I get it, there is no need to repeat the same thing over and over again. They could have found a less obnoxious way to express the moral. The plot is the usual stuff that you get from a superhero movie. There are the bad guys and the good guys, the last ones win, but this time there is not a complete happy ending.Special effects are really bad and have aged even worse. How with a budget of 160 million dollars they flunked in this department is a complete mystery to me. Emma Frost, when she has her mutant form, seems like a polygonal character from the first 2000s video games, with unrealistic movements and textures all over the place. A lot of animation looked so unrealistic and awful. CGI looks unpolished and unfinished.Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy basically carried this movie on their shoulders. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely insufferable and completely flat, the rest of the cast was simply unmemorable. Not a good start for this franchise. I will try to watch the rest of the series, hoping that it will eventually get better, but this motion picture was extremely disappointing and underwhelming.","

"X-Men: First Class","Kia00","29 May 2011","An outstanding effort, what a superb early summer this has been! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond great. Bryan Singer is back and it clearly showed. Add director Vaughn's touch and both display an amazing vision. They manage to keep the story intense and flowing but filled with depth and heart. They also kept an eye on what has come before without being burdened or overly tied to it. If you've never seen any x-film, you'll still love this movie. That said, it builds for another installment and I absolutely can't wait to see it and to see where we go next. The Singer and Vaughn team also manages to deliver a little bit of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. There's intrigue, romance, conspiracy, drama, conflict, historical context, retro flavor, fun, humor and of course, kick butt comic book style slugfests. I think this is now the best comic book movie summer ever (even though it's not even officially summer yet) and I'm not exaggerating. 2008 was great but I think we have a new king. Thor was pure greatness and Captain America looks superb. This was the only question mark from Marvel's stable and they absolutely hit it out of the park. Erik and Charles are now given room to thrive and breathe, find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate as the situations become more dire. Not many adaptations have ever dug as deep as First Class. These are truly some of the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero based movie. They're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they match the best of their rich, four-color origins. They become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures and I can't wait to see where this new cast takes us from this point forward.I love this younger Xavier and the fact that his youthful flaws are fully on display. Charles is caught up in himself as most people are in their youth. He is proud and confident young man, and he's certainly not the selfless person that we saw in the X-Men trilogy. I love the fact that the writers were smart enough to convey these elements and show a young man in need of growth. They easily could've made him a ""mini me"" version of Patrick Stewart's Xavier. Instead they went much deeper and the result is much more interesting. Charles' relationship with Raven/Mystique is fascinating especially when you compare both character to what they will become later. She's an assistant to him and he cares for her, but his ego causes unintended consequences. At times, Charles gives off a condescending, big-brother attitude and that fits so well to the growth the character needs to undertake. You see it in the way he treats the others. In the trilogy, he's exorcised that from his personality. Here, his ego is on a par with Magneto and that makes for an interesting dynamic. Overall, just like X2, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie.","

"X-Men: First Class","chandean-69762","23 January 2021","I guess i'm on the opposition here. I found this film pretty boring and tonally inconsistent.
It seemed like it wanted to be fun and exciting, and then it would switch and want to be serious and dive into specific characters and their psyche, it just didn't work. The story as a whole was boring, only really there to confirm what we know from the previous films so none of this comes off as new.
Most of the mutants like Havok and Angel feel like they're only introduced to serve one part in the final battle and then that's it. And good god, Beast looks awful.
Speaking of the final battle though, it was entertaining and actually gripped me which goes against the previous hour and a half of the film which was a total bore.","

"X-Men: First Class","chaos-rampant","10 September 2011","Say, you wanted to see a bunch of sketches that explain the X-Men as we've come to know them; how Magneto came by the helmet, what threw Xavier on the wheelchair, a bunch of ironic reversals about who sides with who as eventually the deck is stacked. You will probably have a good time.Everything else is mostly dismal. When the arch-nemesis warns a bunch of fresh-cut mutants they are going to be 'enslaved' by the human majority, the filmmaker cuts to a close-up of the one among them who is black. It's this much without class, without some finesse. For the entire movie we fly back and forth; from Vegas, where the ideal place for the lavish, secret hideout - accessed no less by a revolving couch - is adjucent to a strip joint, to the 'concealed CIA base' that is a dozen acres covered with buildings that look like CIA. Or freely, magically transported outside the home of a Soviet general only there to be reminded that our presence could light the fuse of another world war.It is James Bond stuff at best. Like with James Bond, the filmmakers attempt to infuse some credulity to the comic-book shenanigans by situating them inside swathes of history that hold some familiarity and allure. So, everything is hastily crammed inside the box that reads Cold War history. There are ex-Nazis hiding out in Latin America - with a veiled reference to Colonia Dignidad. The climax is a liberal enactment of the Cuban missile crisis.Oh, we're served again with 'us and them' trite dilemmas, as in all the previous X-Men films. There are people who are understanding, awe-struck before the mysterious powers, but a handful of them; most are ignorant dumbasses or the scheming scum we have come to understand populate the upper echelons of the military - secret government aristocracy.What is basically left, is the noisy, effect-laden attractions; watch this because you can't think of a better movie where a submarine is lifted out of the water.","

"X-Men: First Class","krachtm","8 September 2011","I'm perfectly willing to accept that certain characters and plot points must change when you adapt from one media to another, especially when you're talking about a two hour action movie aimed at kids. However, the liberties taken with the characters in this movie are simply too much for me to wrap my head around. Sebastian Shaw is a WWII Nazi war criminal? In the comics, he's an amoral, American businessman who joins a secret society, kills all the leaders, and usurps control. That's a pretty scary guy. Does he really have to become an over-the-top Josef Mengele stand-in? Charles Xavier and Mystique are now step-siblings? OK, I'm willing to accept Shaw as a Nazi war criminal if I must, but this is just bizarre. Most of the characters have their nationalities switched around for no apparent reason. Furthermore, their ages are all messed up, with Havok (Cyclops' younger brother) being particularly paradoxical, now that he's old enough to be his elder brother's father. Seriously, I can forgive a lot of stuff, but this is just sloppy beyond belief.OK, so the continuity is all messed up, the characters and their interactions are completely revamped, and this is apparently meant to be a reboot, not a prequel. How is the actual movie, once you get beyond the issues regarding the source material and continuity? Well, I'd like to say it gets substantially better, but there are several really annoying aspects to it. First of all, there's a token black guy who's introduced and then almost instantly killed off. Seriously? I can't believe that we're still doing that in 2011. Emma Frost, the White Queen, was never one of my favorite characters. I always felt that she was one of the worst examples of the objectification of women in comic books, and she's played completely straight in this movie. Her stripperific costumes are toned down quite a bit, however. The X-Men, after weathering an attack by Shaw and his associates, go through an intense week of training, where they each suddenly have individual epiphanies and become self-confident bad asses, getting beyond whatever psychological issue was holding them back. Ugh. It reminded me of a horrible 80s movie, but, luckily, we were spared the training montage set to Eye of the Tiger. However, what really annoyed me was the ease with which characters flip-flopped between good and evil. One simplistic speech is enough to change almost anyone's mind, it seems. Then again, this is a comic book movie for kids and young adults, so I guess you can't really expect anything deep. Action movies aren't generally known for their deeply philosophical dialogue and strongly written characters. The X-Men have never been intellectual, highbrow entertainment, but they were written better than this, and they deserve better than this.","

"X-Men: First Class","asda-man","19 June 2014","I should probably start by saying that this is my first X Men movie. They've never interested me before and neither has any superhero movie really. I've never seen Captain America, Thor or even The Avengers which everyone seems to rave about. I just find them a bit silly and geeky. If I was 10 years younger or a fan boy then I might like them, but I'm not. I'm not completely against superhero films though. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy features two of my favourite films of all time (TDK and TDKR) but they have an element of realism and are just exceptionally made.I decided to give First Class a go because everyone was raving about the latest X Men film, Days of Future Past. Plus, I had heard a lot of great things about First Class and it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who directed the brilliant Kick-Ass (another comic book film I actually really like). However, this film really didn't live up to its hype.I just don't understand all the love for this film. I found it pretty laughable from the moment it started with the terrible child actors and melodrama verging on parody. The moment where Erik's mother gets shot by Nazi Kevin Bacon (no, I'm not making that up) should've been heart-breaking and really emotional, but the scene just ended up being a joke! The bombastic music, the over-acting from the kid and Kevin Bacon and the rushed directing just meant that I couldn't take the film seriously. Unfortunately the rest of the film continues in this manner.First Class is definitely a film only kids or fan boys would appreciate. It's so daft and contrived with flat characters. Kevin Bacon is a complete caricature as the villain and the X men themselves are also very cartoony. James McAvoy's character was particularly obnoxious, although I did enjoy Michael Fassbender's slightly more complex character of Erik, who ends up turning into a caricature villain for little reason.Even though the film is over two hours in length it still feels very rushed and withdrawn. The constant globe-trotting meant that you never knew exactly where you are or what's going on! The screenplay is also terribly contrived and very cheesy. All of the dialogue feels incredibly forced and I couldn't help but curl my toes with the end line where Michael Fassbender says, ""No not Erik... I'm Magneto!"" Some of the imagery was also just downright bizarre! A man puts his head in a fish tank and grows gills whilst a stripper flutters about with fairy wings whilst shooting fire from her mouth! I don't know what the writers were smoking, but I'd try some!I also found the film quite sexist. It seemed compulsory for all the female characters to show as much leg as possible, even those who worked in the FBI. The FBI agent even goes a step further by stripping down to her bra and pants to covertly follow a bunch of prostitutes into a location. Most, if not all the female characters were objectified in some way and I found it a little depressing. Jennifer Lawrence's sexy blue character was even given ageless cells or something, which explains why she doesn't age in the later films, even though the men do because otherwise she wouldn't be sexy anymore.Most of the action relied on CGI and a lot of it looked pretty appalling and I think it will age extremely badly in a few years time. Having said that, I did quite enjoy how off the wall the action scenes were, especially the last half hour where a submarine levitates out of the ocean, an anchor slices a ship in half and fifty missiles are deflected back into the ocean. It's just insane, and so daft that it's actually really fun to watch.I was never bored during First Class because it was very entertaining, but not in a good way. It was kind of so bad it was good and I started to have fun counting all of the contrived and cheesy lines. I find it baffling how seriously well-liked this film is though. Everything about this film is very over-the-top from the acting to the action sequences. It's also very poorly written with dull characters making puzzling decisions. The way Jennifer Lawrence's character suddenly joined the bad side wasn't explained at all! First Class is a complete mess, but it's a pretty entertaining one. I won't be wasting any money on Days of Future Past though.","

"X-Men: First Class","StarkTech","3 June 2011","Overall, X-Men is a great film. It features outstanding performances (Fassbender and McAvoy are amazing), a smart script, and plenty of action. I love the fact that when we meet Erik (Fassbender) in this film, his life is more about revenge than anything else. Here, he's a lone wolf and he's on a very specific mission and he's Machiavellian in his approach to whatever ends justify the means. I also loved that we get to see why both Xavier and Erik want to be friends. You see the moment they meet. You don't just start the film and they're buddies and that's exactly what the story requires. We also get to see something quite tragic and deep about their relationship because it's not a small thing that makes it crumble. It's only one element in their relationship but it's as complex as it gets. This film is just so textured and layered and that's refreshing in so many ways.They really have delivered a rarity in Hollywood – a prequel that not only outperforms the original film, but one that gives the audience credit. If you really want to enjoy the subtleties of First Class you should see at least the first two X-Men first. It's certainly not necessary because this films stands up all on its own but it makes it even more interesting. No time is wasted or needed explaining what they are about to set up but it's fascinating to see these characters introduced and eventually grow to what they become. We're treated to character and story development, expanding the X-Men saga rather than retelling it for everyone whom missed the first installment. Personally, I'm pleasantly amazed that Fox of all studios allowed the release of a blockbuster sequel that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator. It's refreshing to be treated as something other than a drooling movie-going moron. X-Men First Class works on so many levels and I absolutely love it! If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. If this instant classic isn't the best movie of 2011, then this will truly be the best year in cinematic history. First Class is just flat out awesome.","

"X-Men: First Class","toqtaqiya2","12 July 2011","X-Men: First Class is a good summer blockbuster. Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) crafted an engaging and entertaining film that, in the X-Men film series, is bettered only by X2 (2003). It acts as a prequel/reboot covering the origins of the X-Men in an alternate history where the powerful mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempts to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are signed up by US intelligence to foil Shaw's plans, and in the process they become good friends. The CGI is not perfect, but it's put to very good use. The story is solid (helped by the good script) with doses of effective humor throughout. Strongest in the film is the characterization. There are several notable performances. Bacon, McAvoy and especially Fassbender are in excellent form. The supporting cast is fine too (Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, Jennifer Lawrence being the standouts). Better superhero films have been made, but First Class is definitely a WOW movie. It's a good example of what summer movies should be like. I recommend seeing it.","

"X-Men: First Class","griffolyon12","3 June 2011","Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr (a.k.a Professor X and Magneto, for those not in the know), meet and become friends, then tragedy corrupts their unique relationship when mankind refuses to accept them for what they are. As it is, there are always two sides to the same coin. Erik carries a Nazi coin the entire movie, a memento that helps him remember his mother's killer; a nice touch by way of screen storytelling, giving us viewers a visual cue to remember the character's emotional anguish of watching his mother gunned down before his eyes. However, the coin that Erik and Charles reside upon flips up into the air at the end of this film, but this is not about which side the coin lands, but how we get there.X-Men: First Class details the days before the X-Men, the days before Charles and Erik were known as Professor X and Magneto. These were the days that Charles was a silver spoon playboy, who is compassionate, but may be too cocky for his own good. Compare that to Erik, who grew up in a Nazi concentration camp to watch a mutant named Sebastian Shaw murder his mother before his eyes. Now, as a young man, Erik scours the globe to avenge his mother's death and kill Shaw. Yes, this is the 1960s! The Cuban Missile Crisis! A time of great divide, and at a point in American history, right before everything just kinda goes South. Sebastian Shaw is manipulating the Russians and the U.S. to start World War III, and Charles is recruited by the CIA to help create a mutant division and stop this war. With Erik's help, Charles trains many young mutants to make up this team, from Mystique, to a personal favorite of mine, Beast.There is a sophistication to X-Men: First Class. Director Matthew Vaughn evokes the visual style of 1960s pop art in his direction, using kinetic visuals and fanciful camera movements to create a sense of being lead through this world, but never feeling as if we're being pushed. Vaughn in particular should be commended for being able to balance the dual origins of Charles and Erik, as it takes nearly the first half hour to finally see these two meet. The first thirty minutes jet all the way from Oxford, England, to Vegas, to Switzerland, to Argentina, Germany, and Rochester, New York. There are tons of stamps on the suitcase within the first act alone, but Vaughn makes the transitions smooth and natural, a feat that is hard to explain in words, but makes the difference upon viewing the film.With an arc of revenge, Michael Fassbender gets the meatiest role to play as Erik, but to say that James McAvoy does not succeed as Charles would be incorrect as well. To be honest, Erik is the scene stealer of the entire movie. This is Magneto as he has never been seen before. For once the viewer does not see Magneto as a manipulator of the plans, but actually use his powers in action, as a soldier, an action hero who must find a place between peace and anger in order to truly master his powers. Seeing Charles trying to teach Erik how to master his powers, shows how these two characters develop such a memorable friendship, keeping up the mantra of the entire movie. There is very little told, it is always shown to us, making X-Men: First Class a visual masterwork, and a joy for escapist popcorn entertainment with the action exhilarating, and all of the cast looking as if they had fun (especially Kevin Bacon, knocking villain, Sebastian Shaw, out of the park).With that all said, X-Men: First Class all boils down to being comfortable in one's skin and how should someone different approach being different in normal society. Should they hide being a mutant, or should they have mutant pride? This question has been the foundation of nearly all of the X-Men films, so this may not be new territory, but the examination of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto, is what this movie is truly about. The journey these two men go on is exciting, beautiful, and heartbreaking, making X-Men: First Class must see entertainment.I give X-Men: First Class a 10 out of 10!","

"X-Men: First Class","blackdoug","1 June 2011","Just like X2, First Class is a film classic that will endure and resonate for years to come. Bring on the Next Class! Both Erik and Charles are two of the coolest and most charismatic characters to ever hit the big screen. Now I know why Magneto was reading ""The Man Who Would Be King"" in X2! I really love this film. The acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right, and honestly felt that way. This movie delivers on its characters, and the action scenes are there only to advance plot and build character, and that's the best kind of action sequences. The X-Men have hit their stride again and while still at Fox... go figure! Xavier is a fleshed out and complex character. Mystique proves why she's a fan favorite. Magneto is a vicious but charming and persuasive bastard. Hank is a tragic and endearing figure. Alex is filled with emotion. Darwin is pure empathy. Emma is as sexy as sin. Shaw is a perfect villain. The FX is Oscar worthy. What's not to love?","

"X-Men: First Class","daniyalkhan857","2 April 2015","The Movie is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends. See the movie!","

"X-Men: First Class","cadillac20","3 June 2011","There are a few things that a summer blockbuster should be. First and foremost, they should be entertaining. Summer is all about being big and being fun. Secondly, they should be well made. Good acting, good direction, good script...films in general should have this, but a good summer film can back up it's special effects and action with quality filmmaking. And finally, they should focus more on the deeper things, like themes and humanity than their shallow action or comedy elements. First Class, much to my surprise, embodies all of these and creates a truly wonderful summer blockbuster.While many might be skeptical that the fifth X-men film would certainly be one of the worst, the fact is, it's probably the best. Where the other films tried to focus on the Marvel universe and the wow factor of the X-men and their powers, pleasing fanboys with wonderful visuals and nods here and there, First Class puts it's characters first. Sure, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but the focus on the characters first is a welcome change. In fact, it makes me think of the original X-men film, a film which is now more than ten years old. The quality of the filmmaking here is leagues beyond the original film. Here we have top notch performances, and while there is certainly no outranking Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen, the entire cast for First Class seems to work so very well. I can't remember enjoying the entire ensemble cast from the original trilogy as much as I did here. This is certainly thanks to Matthew Vaughn, who seems to do an extremely good job handling origin stories. Much like he did with Kick Ass, this film is well grounded, despite featuring a large number of mutant power-fueled action sequences.And that's the real trick here. The film strikes the perfect balance between action and drama. There is one scene in particular between Charles and Erik that is very touching and goes far beyond any scene from any of the previous X-Men films. The action is very fun too, and some of my favorites of these involve Banshee's combination of flight and super sonic super powers. Suffice to say, while this film could have simply been a great action film with great performances, in the same way Thor was, it goes beyond by adding a load of heart. There's even some nods to the original films, including an applause inducing cameo, that will have fans salivating. Suffice to say, I can't praise the film enough. It's certainly not without it's flaws. Kevin Bacon's performance, when in comparison to the others, is a little underwhelming. As others have said, he hams it up. And it's not even so bad, except that everyone else just plays their parts so well, his seems a little, as stated, underwhelming. Other parts seem to be thrown in without much to do, namely Darwin, who is barely on screen. But these are minor complaints, as this is a fantastic comic book film. While Marvel's lineup has come a long way, their films continue to get better and better. First Class is a large step in the right direction for the X-Men series of films. If they were to say they were giving the series a reboot, with this kind of quality, you would have no complaints from me.","

"X-Men: First Class","MLDinTN","6 March 2012","All these very positive reviews on here must be from people whom didn't see the first X-Men movie because this one pales in comparison. I really liked the first one, but this one was just not that good. The actors and characters are not as good and the story line is much slower.The main plot is how Magneto and Xavier were friends at first and worked together but then parted ways as Magento saw their mutations as a way to dominate humans. They find other mutants in the most boring musical montage. The only redeeming character is the baddie played by Kevin Bacon. He was a great bad guy.FINAL VERDICT: After seeing it, I say skip it.","

"X-Men: First Class","Prismark10","11 January 2014","The X Men trilogy seems to have been nicely wrapped up. Of course 20th Century Fox do not want the film rights to revert to Marvel films.So they have to continue the series either with the Wolverine spinoff's or in this case with the prequels.X-Men First Class should not had worked but be seen as a cheap knock off prequel. However director Matthew Vaughn has injected a lot of love and verve here.Like X-Men 1, the film starts in a concentration camp during World War 2 where Dr Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) is experimenting on Jews and Mutants including a young boy called Erik Lensherr.In New York City, a telepathic boy, Charles Xavier meets a young shape-shifter called Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), whose natural form is a scaly blue-skin.Xavier invites her to live with his family as a sort of foster sister.After graduation from Oxford University, Xavier later meets the more volatile Lensherr who discovers that Shaw is also a powerful mutant and wants to take him down for what he did to him in World War 2.Yet at the same time there is something about Shaw's outlook that attracts Lensherr and this causes friction with Xavier.Here is an origins story that really meshes with the X-Men films as we see the forming of the friendship with Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender.)Both actors excel in their roles. You root for both of these characters even though the seeds for their rivalry has already been sown.The film has great production design and costumes. It shows as the film is set in the past and uses historical events such as the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis to drive the story along.The performances from Kevin Bacon as the villain is instrumental in making the film work. He is a despicable villain and amoral.He is the one that points Magneto the dark side that not matter what good the mutants do, humans will never accept them.I was sceptical of how good the film would be when it was announced, thinking this as a cynical milking of the franchise.Instead it has breathed new life to the X-Men films in more ways than the Wolverine spin off did.","

"X-Men: First Class","tomgillespie2002","12 June 2011","Things were looking good for the X-Men back in 2003. The first film was a box-office success and was a pretty solid blockbuster. Then X2 came and the bar was raised not only for X-Men films, but for superhero movies in general. Bryan Singer had made an exciting action film that had interesting, fully-developed and endearing characters. Then Singer dropped out in order to make Superman Returns, and for some reason left the job to Hollywood s**t-stain Brett Ratner. X-Men: The Last Stand was an over-populated, lazily directed mess, and Ratner had thought it would be a good idea to cast Vinnie Jones. It seemed to be the closure of the X- Men series, until X-Men Origins: Wolverine came along and gave a backstory to fan-favourite Wolverine. Even though it was directed by the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (who directed the excellent Tsotsi), it was the worst of the lot. Studio interference has made it a bumbling, boring mess of a movie. But still the X-train carries on, and still had the ability to attract rising director Matthew Vaughn.Set in 1962, it follows a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is graduating from University and living with his best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Xavier is seemingly fascinated with genetic mutation that has given him the gift of reading minds, and given Raven the ability to morph into anyone. Meanwhile, vengeful concentration camp survivor Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to find the fled Nazis that led to the death of his parents, and, ultimately, to find Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who first discovered his gift for magnetism. Shaw is now on a quest to strike a deal with the U.S.S.R. that will lead to the destruction of America. Lensherr realises he must join forces with Xavier and recruit new mutants in order to fight this threat, and eventually being accepted into a discriminative world.One of the underlying themes of the X-Men films is the idea of discrimination against the mutants. It is the key thing that eventually lead to Xavier and Lensherr (later to become Professor X and Magneto) ultimately becoming enemies. Xavier feels that the best way to show the human population that the mutants do not pose a threat is to rise above the 'racial' hatred. Magneto takes it as a way to feel superior, and therefore hell-bent on teaching the humans a lesson. Magneto feels deeply about this due to his childhood in Auschwitz, and the death of his parents. This deep-rooted hatred is explored early on in First Class as Lensherr scours Europe killing people on his Nazi list.This is one of the problems with First Class, as the film is bound to the fate that we as the audience already know. Xavier must lose the use of his legs. Magneto and Raven (later to become Mystique) must become evil. Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) must turn into Beast. The Cerebro must be built. Often the film becomes so insistent in developing these ideas that it loses focus on its own storyline and characters. As a result, the plot can often feel muddled, and the new mutant additions are thinly-conveyed and uninteresting.The one true masterstoke in the film is the casting of Michael Fassbender. I've long been an admirer after seeing him as Bobby Sands in Hunger, and then go on to make Fish Tank and Inglourious Basterds. He portrays Magneto torn both by anger and helplessness devised from his childhood, and plays it with utter conviction. His early scenes travelling across Europe are the best moments in the film, and makes me wish they had gone ahead with their earlier plans in giving Magneto his own origin movie. McAvoy, however, although possessing a lot of charm, suffers from having Patrick Stewart's shoes to fill. His friendship with Raven is just not convincing.There's a definite feeling that the film has been rushed. Vaughn's earlier efforts in the fantasy field - Kick-Ass and Stardust - flowed, and never lacked in the special effects department. Here, the film seems to frantically pacing for the climax, with no real moments of character development, and some of the special effects don't come near to the standards of other films these days. It is, though, undoubtedly enjoyable. The action scenes don't exactly blow anything out of the water, and don't even surpass the original two, but they are at least fun. I hope if they do make another film, they concentrate on the story rather than looking at the future, and set the foundations for what could become a solid franchise in it's own right.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"X-Men: First Class","edmondoster","10 June 2011","This movie should had been named: ""MAGNETO"" or better; ""Magneto's love story with hate"".ALL the previous Xmen films bespoke of friendship, camaraderie and humanity and the best positive traits associated with these basic qualities and these films contained the positive traits which define the Xmen... and what makes them attractive & engaging... for me at-least. ""First Class"" seriously lacks these good qualities. And it replaces all that was good, moral or engaging with the Xmen franchise with only one thing; Magneto's hate. Almost all characters in the movie, including the amazing, great character of Prof. Charles Xavier is, at the hands of the ""hooh-haah"" director Matthew Vaughn, reduced to ""second class"" citizens (yes, definitely, pun-intended) in order to allow the glorification of Magneto's HATE. The ""chutzpah"" is in that the director does it, in plain sight, all the while asking us-- to applaud Magneto and to create in us, fans and viewers, a sense of wonder and awe about how ""cool"" Magneto's awful and cruel shenanigans throughout the movie, are. Why is Magneto shown off in this movie as ""the underdog hero""? And why is this done, while trampling on other and better characters of the Xmen franchise? Why is Prof. Xavier reduced, in the hands of Vaughn, to a mere sidekick and 2'nd grade character, whose only existence, according to Vaughn's movie, is to showcase and highlight how 'cool' and defiant Magneto's bottom-line cruelty, is-- in almost every single scene in which Prof.X and Magneto appear together?? I'm sure there are more knowledgeable and ""professional"" Xmen fans than me, out there, in the world. However, some things are very clear. No matter how good you're familiar with the Xmen or how many fan-stripes you have on your badges. Magneto is NOT the 'good'-cool-wow protagonist. He simply is NOT that. Prof. Xavier is NOT Magneto's sidekick-glorifier, whose sole purpose is to show how ""cool"" we should perceive (by Vaughn) Magneto as. Prof. X is so much... so much more than that.And what's with Mystique? Why's she's Prof. X's girlfriend at first, and then she goes... how weird and ugly is that? What's that supposed to mean... I mean except that she's a... -- well, of a truly questionable character, you know?Yes, I know what Vaughn is trying to get us convinced in; Magneto had ""that"" childhood, in the Shoah... Really? We knew that from the first shot in Singer's ""Xmen"". Does that condone the terrible things Lensher/Magneto does 'because' of it? Ask Vaughn; he knows. Vaughn says a big ""yes"". Oh... I guess that having that Shoah childhood allows Lensher to do EVERYTHING now, in the name of revenge. In Singer's ""Xmen"" (2000), Singer trusts our judgment, to decide; whether we choose to view Magneto as a 'good guy'/'bad guy'. Vaughn doesn't ""trouble"" us with that issue; Vaughn is after ""cool""... that's what he cares about. For Vaughn, the issue Good versus evil turns to a 'second class citizen' (pun intended, again) when 'the COOL factor' enters the game. Vaughn is so eager to present Magneto as ""cool"" and as poised as James Bond or Bruce Wayne, that he simply throws the fact that this character is utterly cruel & immoral, right out the window. Why not? The applaud sign goes up after showing yet another of Magneto's beastiality.I read a reviewer saying that this new movie doesn't need Wolverine. Why? Because, according to this big-shot reviewer, Magneto 'more than makes up' for Wolverine's absence... Really?? At the ending of 2000's ""Xmen"", Wolverine sacrifices his life, knowingly and intentionally, in order to save Rogue's life. That's what makes Wolverine--- Wolverine. That's what makes him a hero, in my book. Yes, it's cool; those adamantium claws, that no-hold bars attitude...But these do not a HERO make. What Wolverine does for Rogue to live, at the end of 2000's Xmen, at the expense of his own life... that's what a hero make. Contrastingly, consider what Lensher/Magneto does 'for' his mutant comrades/friends in the end of ""Xmen:FC""... -- Lensher disposes of his enemies (or more correctly; rivals) in a way that would Nazi sympathizers proud. --- He is responsible, even if in-directly, for the permanent maiming and crippling of the only man (Prof. X) who ever chose to try to persuade him to see beyond his selfish hate. --- He steals that's man sister/girlfriend (who was selfish throughout anyway... no big loss, but still), and eventually leaves that person abandoned, badly hurt and crippled permanently while he still goes out to pursue his still unsatisfied selfish goals for domination over those who 'don't see his way'. With friends like Lensher, who even needs enemies? Ask Prof. X. He learnt that the hard way. Vaughn is so taken by admiration to Magneto, trying to pitch him off and out as no-less than the ""new James Bond""... that he (Vaughn) even gives Magneto a ""Bond. James Bond"" kind of line in the ending of the film... which is not only plain ugly... but also very condescending.Problem is: X-MEN was never, at it's very core and it's most fundamental message-- a one-man show (like Bond or 'solo' superheroes)!!! X-men was, forever, a 'team-effort' showcasing & celebrating the need to band together and be AS A TEAM one for the other. X-men in many of it's incarnations, celebrated unity and celebrated TRUE friendship & camaraderie. That is... until ""hooh-haah"" director Matthew Vaughn came along with ""First Class"" and stripped the Xmen of their most valuable and True badge of Honor. And Vaughn replaced that Xmen badge of Honor and all it stood for- - for one thing alone: Magneto's praise song, sung by Magneto (and Vaughn), applauding and celebrating hatred. By going against everything the Xmen ever stood for... this movie becomes the worst X-men movie to-date and a major disappointment.","

"X-Men: First Class","DICK STEEL","2 June 2011","Bryan Singer's involvement in this film is a good thing, with his producer credit as well as getting involved in the story together with Sheldon Turner, since he was responsible for the first two critical and commercial hit of the X-Men films being able to show that an ensemble comic book film can work. But since a new direction was called for to wash away the bitter aftertaste of the latter two films of the franchise, in comes director Matthew Vaughn who did a class job in playing this film to its strengths, keeping the pace tight, the action eye popping, and the dramatic elements engaging. It seems like Vaughn is on a roll here in his choice of projects, and I'm hoping this one does well enough to warrant yet another outing with the X-Men, so long as the focus remains on wanting to tell a solid, strong story first like this one did, and not opt for something loud and mindless.There are many elements of this film which made it enjoyable. For starters, having it go back to the good old 60s was an excellent move par none, taking us back to the point of the US- USSR nuclear crisis, where the US had strategically put nukes in Turkey, and the USSR soon to be responding with its own countermove involving Cuba. The historical context makes it a little bit more in line with our reality, though having the audacity to suggest that the evil mutants led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Six Degrees Bacon) and his team of Emma Frost (January Jones, playing a character who will probably be a fan favourite after this), Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) and Azazel (Jason Flemying) have starring roles in stirring up the super power rivalry to WWIII proportions.The plan is simple, and in Sebastian Shaw we see the precursor of the mantle that Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) would pick up from, since it's an Us Mutants against Them Humans mindset they adopt, preferring a more vocal outburst of opposition against discrimination, even if it means annihilation of those who are ordinary. Followers of X-Men the comics or the films would find this theme familiar, but in Vaughn's film, ample time is provided to develop the arguments against, and the very sexy arguments for this cause, with lines being deeply divided thus showing why and who decided to join which side of the war.Then of course there's the strong friendship between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto which was always hinted at in the earlier films, but this one brings us back to the origins of their friendship which developed so strongly given their unison to battle a common enemy, but their inevitable drift when their ideals and methodology start to differ drastically, one obviously preferring violence and using whatever means necessary to further the cause, and the other opting for a more peaceful approach, preferring to do good to convince us two-timing, fearful humans that those more powerful aren't necessary harbouring intentions to enslave, but just yearning for a peaceful co-existence. Both McAvoy and Fassbender excel in their leading roles as friends who will turn enemies in due course, making it all the more poignant when we see them do battle shoulder to shoulder now, knowing what will happen in the near future.If it was an Origins film that was still mooted, then this one takes the cake indeed, with scenes showing off younger versions of Xavier and Lehnsherr, together with that of the other X-Men such as Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who forms a tight relationship with Xavier before identity crisis meant a souring of sorts to what the future story would hold, the intelligent Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Havok (Lucas Till) amongst others in the first class fold, tutored and mentored personally by Xavier to harness their powers, before the big bang action sequence that expectedly combined everyone's strength to do battle against those on the opposite side.Art direction was also down to a pat, where computers are large and imposing with plenty of buttons, gauges, valves and humongous tape drives, and who can forget the pristine looking Blackbird jet plane making its debut as the de-facto transport of choice for the X-Men, and that predominantly yellow suits also given a reason for the characters to don them. The ensemble cast of relative unknowns in leading roles also worked wonders, especially those amongst the new recruits since they are predominantly younger and are quite raw in the art of combat, and making mistakes, rather than being all too invulnerable, is the rule of thumb here. Visual effects are flawlessly employed to showcase their various powers.X-Men: First Class brings us back to the time that examines the history of the X-Men before events of the first film kicked in, where Wolverine was still yet to be thrown into the Weapon X project, and before the likes of Jean Grey and Cyclops came into the picture. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for plenty of easter eggs and subtle references made in terms of what we already do know of the characters in the earlier films, and the irony in dialogue, making this X-Men first class indeed. Highly recommended, and a definite favourite of the summer films so far.","

"X-Men: First Class","judywalker2","25 September 2011","I am really surprised that so many people liked this movie. I found it quite boring. Maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast Kevin Bacon as a psycho ex Nazi mutant scientist but I think it was really, really a bad idea. The two leads were okay but for the most part the story was just so, so and really didn't help define the characters at all. In fact some of Erik (ultimately Magneto's) actions are inconsistent to what he should have done with all of his power. Again the character of Charles Xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends to be effective as a leader. The comic book Xavier has always been better than anything they have put on screen, small or large.","

"X-Men: First Class","blacklist-1","9 June 2011","Like many audience members of Hollywood cinema, I am a big fan of the X- Men franchise, despite having never read the comics. The first two films in 2000 and 2003 were massive hits and I loved them. But then tragically X-Men 3: The Last Stand made an unwelcome appearance on our screens in 2006. For me it was one of the worst superhero movies I had encountered and this is where like many franchises that do sequels, by the third most have been wrung out and I thought X-Men has run it's course. But then thankfully in 2009, director Gavin Hood decided to do a prequel of mutant Wolverine, which I really enjoyed and restored my faith in the franchise in what I thought was broken.When initially I heard there was going to be a fifth X-Men with the origins of Magneto and Charles Xaiver I was excited and even more so when I heard it was a prequel/reboot, where after First Class, there is a commission for two more. I looked at the reviews on here and was taken aback at how hyped up this movie was. I will be honest I was a bit sceptical after recent films that I have seen at the pictures I have seen that have been hyped up and been for me highly over-rated, one being the terrible superhero movie Thor. However I am more than pleased to say X-Men First Class lives up to it's reputation by the audience and fulfilled it's title by being first class all the way. I would say it is the best superhero movie of this year and arguably the best I have seen since Batman Begins (2005 and yes even better than The Dark Knight!). One thing I was very pleased about with this X-Men film is the choice of director Matthew Vaughn who from Kick-Ass appreciates that character substance and plot development is as important as the action sequences and special effects and X-Men First Class is the same. Coming in at 132 minutes, Matthew Vaughn impressively has packed a lot in with the story that is balanced well consisting of different mutants coming together like Eric/Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Sean Cassidy/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Alex Summers/Havok (Lucas Till) headed by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is supported by human CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). They are against the other mutants, who include Emma Frost (January Jones), Janos Quested/Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), Azazel (Jason Flemyng) and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, who changes sides from Xavier's to Shaw's) who are headed by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). They have to stop him from using the Russians to start a war against humans by disguising it through the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Meanwhile another plot that is prevalent throughout is Eric's desire for revenge against Shaw who was his creator of his powers and who killed his mother with a sub plot of a potential romance between Raven and Beast.The things that were great about this film that I expected was the superb special effects (I was also pleased that Vaughn decided not to do this in 3D), the action sequences were beautifully choreographed and were enormously destructive and exciting (though just as a little small gripe, I wish there had been a bit more action) and the script though basic did have flashes of wit with some nice comedy (with a small, but fantastic cameo appearance by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who gets a great one liner).The biggest strength though is the character substance and plot development and the acting. The characters of all the different mutants are set up nicely as we learn about their different abilities and they all get their moments to shine. There are great performances across the board particularly by Bacon as Shaw who had a subtle but sharp malevolence, January Jones as Emma Frost and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, but the driving force behind the plot development is Fassbender and McAvoy. They both give excellent performances as Xavier and Eric with some great chemistry on screen. You can clearly see the pain in Eric's eyes as he is consumed with his desire for revenge as all he has known all his life is pain and anger (which helps use his powers) in contrast to Xavier's (a comfortable and painless lifestyle who is smart and quick witted but with a gentle nature). Throughout Vaughn cleverly distinguishes through the dialogue and actions of the two, the differing ideologies and objectives that they both contain as alliances are formed and broken and mutants switch sides. Throughout this divide is apparent as Eric tells Xavier that they as mutants will never be accepted by humans and that they should form their own society and rise to rid the world of humanity (mirroring Shaw's desires), whereas Charles wants to protect them and hopes one day they can co-exist side by side peacefully. The only reason Eric stays alongside Charles is to kill Shaw as they need to stop him. This divide in mutant/human existence ideology is cleverly mirrored in the sub-plot romance between Raven and Beast when Raven wants to be seen for who she is, but Beast wants to look normal like humans.In the end Vaughn has created a film that will appeal to all who are new to the franchise and are loyal fans of the older films. He understands specifically what the audience expected and he delivered. And the fact he can intuitively guess what audiences wants is what I think partly makes this such a success. As I said they are going to make this prequel/reboot a new franchise and to that I say yes please as X-Men First Class is really that brilliant.","

"X-Men: First Class","CaptainxBumout","16 June 2011","Now I'm sure everyone knows who the X-Men are and know about this movie. The trailer really didn't look impressive at all and if I wasn't such a huge Michael Fassbender fan, I probably would have waited to see this movie on DVD. I saw this the day it was released but my computer got a virus so I haven't been able to get a review out until now.Keep in mind I'm a little biased since my favorite actor plays Magneto but I absolutely loved this movie. Sure this isn't about the original X-Men but I feel like movies and comic books are two different entities and if you like one and not the other then that's fine. I used to get upset about stuff not being faithful adaptations but now I don't care since all it does is help people find out about something and they hopefully want to find out more about it and find the original material.The thing that makes this movie so great is that it's not really a superhero movie. I mean sure there are mutants with powers but this movie puts way more emphasis on the story and the main characters as opposed to nonstop action or way to many mutants with powers like in X-Men The Last Stand. This movie is basically a drama with superheroes in it. They utilized Fassbender and McAvoy to a great extent and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) and Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Shaw) did great as well.I liked that they made the movie very dark (as dark as they could make it for PG13) much like The Dark Knight but added in a fair amount of light hearted moments. Magneto was a dark serious person while Professor X was more of an easy going guy. I thought it was a nice touch in seeing how he acted when he was young.Of course there are a couple of nit picks I have with the movie. The kids weren't really given enough screen time but I guess it gave you just enough for the first movie and hopefully we get to see more of them in sequels. Also I liked January Jones in Mad Men but she really does not do any good as Emma Frost. Sure she's good to look at but she's given most of the screen time out of Kevin Bacons henchmen which is weird since she can't really act well. Also I don't think Azazel and Riptide even talk at all during the movie.Overall this has been my favorite movie so far this year. I plan on seeing Super 8 this week so we'll see if that can top this movie. 9/10","

"X-Men: First Class","jtwcosmos","26 August 2011","""I will count to three and you will move this coin.""This is yet another entry in an apparently never ending line of sequels-prequels-shmequels Hollywood keeps turning out, these days. The script sucks, the director is utterly incompetent, the main actors are miscast, the secondary actors are wasted. The entire movie is made of plastic (poster included).The script is a joke. It was written by committee and not even a good one. None of the writers have any major works to their credit and to make maters worse - as if that was even possible - the story is written by none other than Bryan Singer: the guy who ruined every super hero movie he ever touched.The entire movie is nothing more that one huge introduction. Introduce super hero (sorry, mutant) number one. Check. Introduce mutant number 2. Check. Introduce mutant number 3. Check. And so on and so forth. Should they do anything interesting? Anything at all? No, no, no. God forbid they'd do something exciting.Dear writers, this is a prequel, we get it. You have to introduce people, we understand that. But by Golly, why did you have to make them so excruciatingly boring? Couldn't you find them something interesting to do? Anything?The director of this movie is one incompetent bastard. There is nothing that says: ""Hey, that was interesting."" Nothing. This is just one big music video clip, but without the music. The sets are very similar with the ones in Superman Returns: big, expensive and unrealistic. And dead. There is nothing that says: ""We live here"". No. There should be a big sign on the door saying: ""Vacancy. Rooms to rent. Butlers to hire. Everybody's gone fishing. Big discounts!"" (and in smaller letters) ""The place stinks!""The actors are terribly miscast and/or underused. James McAvoy is completely miscast as Professor Xavier, he doesn't look anything like the comics character or like Sir Patrick Stewart, for that matter. Plus his only ability seems to be touching his head with his fingers: ""I'm gonna put my fingers to my head and I'm gonna smack your arse"", he seems to say. Plus he is given the stupidest lines ever: "" Remember, true concentration lies between rage and serenity."" No kidding! Really??Michael Fassbender seems a little more adequate, but nothing about him says: ""Look at me, I'm Magneto"". And to make maters worse, he is not spared the idiotic writing either. I mean, the Nazi doctor kills his mother and the poor kid goes on a rampage killing everybody, but he doesn't kill the guy who did it? Really? What the heck! This is joke, right?Everybody else is wasted in this movie. Oliver Platt and Michael Ironside have a few lines, and Ray Wise is on the screen for about 2 seconds.X-Men: First Class. More like third or fourth class, if you ask me. 2/10.","

"X-Men: First Class","freemantle_uk","3 June 2011","After two disappointing instalments, X-Men fans needed some heroes themselves, people who could revitalise the series and luckily, we got that with the director of the first two films and the man who was originally picked to direct X-Men: The Last Stand. The Bryan Singer/Matthew Vaughn combo was able to give the series the kick it needed, making a fun and action-packed film.In 1962, the privileged Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has graduated from Oxford University with a PhD in Genetics and has a very close relationship with his adopted sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). On the other side of the coin is Erik Lehnsherr (the always awesome Michael Fassbender), a Holocaust surviving, hunting Nazis around the world, overall badass. Both are recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTarget (Rose Byrne) to help stop the Hellfire Club, lead by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and his group of powerful mutants; Emma Frost (January Jones), Azazel (Jason Flemyng), and Riptide (Alex Gonzalez). As the Hellfire Club manipulates the United States and the Soviet Union towards nuclear war, Charles and Erik go on their own recruiting drive to train mutants for their team, including Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Alex Summers (Lucas Till), and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz).From what should have been a disaster of a film, Vaughn pulled it out of the bag and made a really fun summer blockbuster. Compared to Singer's whose X-Men movies were dark, in both story and style, Vaughn made his X-Men film a lighter and more colourful film, with a strong mix of drama and comedy, very much like Spider-man and Iron Man. Because of the quick production time some of the CGI is a bit ropey, but Vaughn proves himself a talented director with a great visual style, from his montages that interject comic book visuals to his action scenes. Vaughn ensures that there is plenty of mutant versus mutant action and just like in the Singer films, mutants use their powers logically. Some of the comedy is predictable, but still funny and the action scenes were tense, unlike Brett Ratner's approach in X-Men: The Last Stand who broke up action sequences with humour.The plot itself is very similar to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, since it comes down to an outside force trying to start a war for their own ends. Continuing with the Bond film there is a certain feel in the early part of the film with Erik's global travelling and the scene with Moira in bra and panties, which was very much like something from a Bond or even Austin Powers movie.X-Men: First Class is a film that focuses on characters and relationships, a strength of any good action film, or as I see it, an X-Men film with action in it. There are strong ideologies being formed with Shaw taking the place of Magneto in this world. There are also ideas about how government circles and intelligence agencies would react to the discovery of a new breed of humanity. The Nazi Scientist was very much like the Emperor in Star Wars, pretty much saying ""let the anger consume you"".What X-Men: First Class needed in order to be successful was a strong chemistry between McAvoy and Fassbender, which we got. They have a yin and yang relationship as they share a goal but have two different ways about how to achieve it, yet you can still believe they are friends. Many of the supporting cast members were strong, Bacon is of course, intelligent and powerful with a sinister Southern accent and capably assisted by the beautiful January Jones. Some of the characters were sidelined, but I am sure they will be developed in the sequel.As a fanboy, I could make a list of things the filmmakers got wrong from the comics and continuity with the first three films, but it was so well made as a stand-alone movie it doesn't really matter. Really, it's just as much a reboot as it is a prequel. There are also plenty of cameos that will keep fans happy. X-Men: First Class is the best X-Men film since X2: X-Men United.","

"X-Men: First Class","bigcalkenobi","5 June 2011","X-men First Class brings the X-men franchise back into the spotlight after two pretty lackluster X-films. First Class goes back to the very beginning of the story of Professor X and Magneto showing us their journey to friendship and destruction. The movie is technically a prequel but it more or less plays like a reboot so that it is very accessible to new viewers but still has several nods to the previous films that will keep fans interested. The movie brings back Bryan Singer(who directed the great X-men and terrific X2) as a producer and brings in Matthew Vaughn(of Kick-Ass and Stardust fame) as the director. This film looks to be the promising comeback for the series that has had a couple of weak entries in the past. Is this possible? After watching the painful X3 and the mixed bag that was X-men Origins:Wolverine the franchise is getting sort of old. Can X-men First Class re-energize this tired franchise or should we pray that this team never makes a comeback?Want to read more?

"X-Men: First Class","EvangelionManFromTheOtherSide","19 June 2011","There are many moviegoers, who are annoyed by the constant releases of superhero movies. Some may even say that superhero flicks are ""the reason behind Hollywood's decline in quality."" I really disagree with what these people say. Superhero movies can be fun to watch, but not all of them are great. I think the major flaw with recent comic book-based movies is that they lack originality, the thing that allows to distinguish one superhero film from another. Yes, I sometimes think that some superhero flicks are the same in terms of content, except with different powers. However, X-Men: First Class was something new, something... original. Since the film is a prequel, originality was the last thing I expected. First Class felt like a brand new film, free from its predecessors. It had charm as a distinct superhero flick, something that Vaughn's previous film, Kick-Ass, came to lose as the film progressed. Although it had its own flaws, X-Men: First Class did not get tedious as the film progressed, and I think it's one of the best superhero films of the last few years.As the title (mildly) implies, the movie focuses on the origins and early days of the X-Men. It is also set in the backdrop of Cold War. Charles Xavier is a telepath who takes interest in other mutants, and hopes for society to accept them. Erik Lensherr is a Jew, who is hunting down former Nazis as revenge for the death of his mother. As the tensions between America and the Soviet Union rises, Charles is recruited by the CIA to stop mutant Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, who are planning to start a third World War. At the same time, Erik attempts to complete his revenge job by killing Shaw, who was the man responsible for killing his mother. Eventually, Charles and Erik meet and form a friendship. Together, they recruit young mutants for the CIA, in hopes of stopping the Hellfire Club and their diabolical plans. The well-assembled cast was basically the high point of the film. McAvoy nails his performance as young Charles Xavier. But the scene stealer of the film was Fassbender, who ""magnifying"" as young Magneto. In addition to the two main leads, the supporting characters were also nicely cast. Lawrence, as Mystique, was a great replacement for Romijn. I've yet see Winter's Bones, but seeing her performance in First Class brings up expectations for the film. Kevin Bacon's role as main antagonist Sebastian Shaw was fantastic. It was like seeing a combination of his role in Hollow Man (mediocre movie) and Frost/Nixon (great film). Byrne, again, was typecast as ""a morally righteous character"", playing CIA agent Moira MacTaggert. Byrne, as an actress, is really underrated, but most of the characters she portrays are too similar to one another. Platt played a minor, yet quite likable character, the Man in Black. Seeing him getting killed off during the first hour of the movie was disappointing. Did he really need to die so early? Wait, I reinstate. Did he even need to die in the first place? Ironically, I wanted his character in 2012 to die in a painful death, yet he survived in the film. Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine in a cameo, and it's absolutely hilarious.The thing that First Class did that X-Men: Wolverine did not was it allowed the audience to view humanity again, like in Singer's films. Although I enjoyed it, Wolverine was too concentrated on the revenge concept to be called really good. In my opinion, making the film a fictional biography would've made it more inspiring. First Class also allowed the audience to see the philosophy of mutants in society from two perspectives: Xavier's belief that society will one day accept mutants, and the belief of Erik that mutants must make their own ""brotherhood"" within society. In the previous X-Men films, the latter idea was not emphasized enough. Indeed, it was brought up, but First Class made it much more relatable. The CGI was quite detrimental to the quality of the film. It's better than the bloated effects of Prince of Persia, but it still didn't look convincing enough. Especially the part when the submarine washes ashore on the island. When it comes to superhero films, visual effects are pretty much essential, and the VFX of First Class was not pretty.The writing served as quite a problem for the film. The story and the characters were written fine, but the dialogue had quite the problems. Mystique/Raven's (repeated) line to the Beast, for example, was beyond clichéd. Also, Magneto final line was not really stunning. Criticizing clichéd dialogues in blockbusters may not be an obligation. Still, the scripting in First Class felt like an exception.Incorporating the Cuban missile crisis into the plot was the best thing that ever happened in a X-Men film. I'm quite fond of seeing actual historical elements in fictional stories. Hence why I loved the storyline of Metal Gear Sold 3, which also utilized Cold War aspects within the fictional mythology of the series. Kennedy appears in an archive footage, by the way.Overall, Vaughn has done a fine job crafting a unique superhero flick. As I've said earlier, the CGI was far from being an Oscar contender, and the dialogue suffers from predictability to laziness. Nevertheless, the cast and its direction make the film highly enjoyable. X-Men: First Class is a great way to spend two hours with solid entertainment. If the new X-Men films continue to be more like First Class, then I don't mind the franchise continuing for another ten years.","

"X-Men: First Class","big_ryan15","26 June 2011","Holy cow, what a movie. Nerd Alert! Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one by themselves would have made the movie terrific,when sharing the screen? Unbelievable! From to start to finish, incredible.Kevin Bacon has never done better,Jennifer Lawrence is awesome, Rose Byrne and January Jones don't have much importance, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside were dispensable, but all in all the cast was spectacular.The story is really well written. Kevin Bacon has a plan. Against him, the goodies work together. Their reasons different, but more or less all they want is him stopped. Charles and Erik are interesting characters. They argue. And we can argue forever about them, and about who is right.As you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you know why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these early days, don't know it yet. To have that so perfectly captured in amovie is part of what makes this a treat and a future classic. Aside from their relationship to each other, the movie takes time to make each of them interesting in their own right. We see Charles as a teacher, and come to understand how he impacts upon the lives of those he teaches. Some of Erik's best moments are in his comments to Mystique about her appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than his past. One scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly scared will certainly make you care about them for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately Sebastian Shaw's henchmen don't get anything to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we know as much about January Jones as we did at the beginning.The FX are crazy good,using actual sets/costumes was a good idea. There are action scenes throughout the movie, the movie grows as it continues. The first part is more story so that when the action starts you care about the characters. Deaths, back-stabbings,awesome cameos and name dropping ensues. Awesome movie, really cool script and two incredible lead performances.I really hope they continue to build from this story. 9/10 One of the best movies in a long long time.","

"X-Men: First Class","Coolphill","1 June 2011","WOW!!! Mathew Vaughn has done it again! This absolutely wipes the floor with x men origins wolverine and X men the last stand, and in my opinion is even better then x men 1 and 2. The story is so well told, all the characters are brilliantly fleshed out and every one of them either has a really interesting character arc or is just awesome or funny. The script is perfect ranging from effective humour, to really dark but emotional scenes (especially a stand out one in a concentration camp), the action is both inventive and astounding with some very clever uses of powers. But the best thing about this is how well every character is explored and how they show some real depth here, in my opinion this is even better intellectually then the dark knight. Everyone gives a great performance too. Nicholaus Hault brings pain and frustration to the character of beast expertly, as does Jenifer Laurence to the character of mystique. but ultimately this is a film about Charles and Erik and when they need to James Mcavoy and Michel Fassbender really display magnificent acting capabilities and presence, the film charts those two coming together as friends and then falling apart, and it does so brilliantly and there performances cement this. I cant recommend X- men first class enough See more","

"X-Men: First Class","karimnn","5 June 2011","I went to see this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8.3! Rarely do we see a title with such a high rating so it must really really good right? Right from the start of the movie the story is completely irrelevant to what the X-Men (and women) are, and I mean completely, it went on and on for about 20 minutes and the topic kept on re-emerging throughout the movie until the end, the guilt and the guilty, the revenge, etc... No spoiler here don't worry. This movie franchise has clearly been hijacked by a group of people that not only don't know how to make movies are terrible at writing scripts and worse at casting. The only person that saved this movie is James McAvoy, everyone else's acting might as well fit out of a teen/pre-teen TV show basically, even Kevinv Bacon was no convincing, I found myself looking around for an exit sign.What happened to the Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry caliber? This movie is so cheap and so disappointing from start to end.","

"X-Men: First Class","James_Dickson","12 June 2011","I'm prepared to forgive the film its poorly explained, misconstrued, evolutionary science, as it is a comic book adaptation after all, but that should not excuse the ponderous emptiness of the story, which detracts significantly from the promising beginnings established in the first film(s). Bereft of compelling character development, sinister undertones and brooding tension, the 'climax' of betrayal and inevitable, prophetic fulfilment were so poorly managed I was left feeling ambivalent and detached; while the rest of the film, with its cheesy 'nudge-wink' humour and clumsy, explanatory dialogue left me head in hands, knuckle-biting, inwardly-sighing and fidgeting with disappointment throughout.I got the impression Matthew Vaughn wanted us to laugh AT the film, with a number of moments where this was seemingly encouraged (Wolverine's cameo, the bedroom scenes, Beasts appearance etc). Was he in fact being a lazy snob toward X-Men just because he had his own little adaptation in Kick-Ass? I had a bad feeling when I discovered Bryan Singer wasn't directing the third film, but little did I realise that X-Men: The Last Stand would actually look good in comparison to First Class. I now await any Kick-Ass sequel/spin-off with unexpected trepidation as I have no idea what Matthew Vaughn was trying here and I was amazed to discover Bryan Singer was actually involved in the creation of this messy film, which ended up being too much of not a lot.All said and done, Fassbender and McAvoy put in decent performances, although Kevin Bacon as the central antagonist was truly underwhelming and un-menacing and if this is the best he's got to offer then he should go back to doing inconsequential cameo's in films like Planes, Trains and Automobiles, or make a prequel of tremors, or just give up. Any of which I would be happy with.","

"X-Men: First Class","PCC0921","4 October 2020","The first two X-men films, X-men (2000) and X-men 2: X-men United (2003), were brilliant movies. The next two films X-men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-men Origins: Wolverine (2009), were pretty good, so I was worried that the fifth film would be a downer, but then I saw the trailers for it and I was pumped and ready to go. The film has an excellent plot idea. The formation of the first team happens during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and two future enemies, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender), meet for the first time.But, that is where the fun ends. Unfortunately, the execution of this script is not good. There is a tedious boring buildup in the first half of the film and by the time the movie ends you wish you had those 2 1/2 hours back. It is a huge disappointment. It is slow and in parts, even silly. When attempting a film such as this, the fifth one in a series, you really need to pay attention to freshness. We already know that the mingling of Mutants with Humans is a metaphor for ethnic tensions in the real world. We also know all about Charles and Erik's history with each other, which I felt was not conveyed convincingly. The ""frenemies"" relationship that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen conveyed in the first three movies was much more convincing and emotionally charged and they were well into the enemies' stage of the relationship by then.The soundtrack is awful and even some of the special effects look off. The dialogue is cartoonish and it really gives the impression that the second stringers made this film. It almost felt like I was watching one of those Live-Action Japanese super-hero shows, like the Power Rangers, especially when the soundtrack came into play. And, when you are attempting to do a big blockbuster prequel, based on one of the most popular super-hero teams ever, don't highlight one of the most boring, stupid characters ever, Banshee, with his silly sonic wings and his dorky sonic scream. I always hated that character. I'm sure I will watch this again someday since it is a part of a set and I can't complain too much since they made it through five movies before they screwed things up, but wow, what a sad mood I was in when I left the theater.6.4 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB","

"X-Men: First Class","kolokithokeftedakia","1 September 2011","Another empty, pointless, tasteless, totally unconvincing film full of super-heroes with unlimited god-like powerZ they took from nowhere, with only a totally paranoid, illogical and ridiculous explanation beyond reason! The film doesn't make any sense at all, even for fantasy genre.The artistic value of the plot is non-existent, zero! I stayed, because of the company I was with. It was one of the worst, intelligence insulting films I ever saw. It seemed it would never end!So I was thinking, in order to enjoy this film, you have to be convinced by the movie script and see that everything fits and makes sense and there is only one way for this (except if you're dumb enough already, or plain immature): You have to forget everything you know and have learned about the laws of this world and the nature of live beings, the genes, everything! After you succeed to reset and empty your brain, clear your memory and deactivate your judging abilities (I.Q=0), then you will have prepared yourself properly to accept passively, without resistance all action in the movie and then you'll truly enjoy it as a life-time experience, until the last line of the credits! Still in that brainless condition with a dumb, frozen smile in your face, you'll come back here and add a raving review about the awesomeness of the movie! Then, you'll become automatically a member of the Next Brainwashed Generation!Unfortunately they target mostly the teenagers -vulnerable, with no mature shields yet...","

"X-Men: First Class","porsche-bush","20 June 2011","usually I am not a fan of marvel comics, but i made an exception for this one :) If you followed the comic book series, it uses similarities from the comics to the movie. And we also get a cameo appearance from Hugh Jackman(Wolverine). I may have not noticed the infamous stan lee appearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his comics. But I am sure it was there. I think its a great movie for ages 5 to adult. It has history, very mild violence, some comedy, drama, and romance. All the elements to live up to the X-Men franchise. It is not at all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the comic book series. That is the only flaw I see. It is definitely a tribute to the fans of X-Men. Personally I am a DC comic books fan, but if you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a treat :) but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you will be disappointed.","

"X-Men: First Class","ivo-cobra8","28 October 2015","X-Men: First Class (2011) is an Awesome Action superhero flick based on a comic book mythology of X-Men where it all begin. This film is close good as X2 it is my third best favorite X-Men film. I love this film! I love James McAvoy as Charles Xavier aka Profesor X later, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique, I also love January Jones as Emma Frost and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr alias Magneto. Gosh I love this film I was entertained from beginning till end. I love this movie, It is a great prequel to the X-Men movies James Mcavoy as young Xavier is great choice and everything of this movie is just Great.Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique I never saw her like that as been a good person, I always though she was bad. In First Class tells the story how everything was. How Eric and Charles become friends and later becomes enemies. The film is actually set from the first X-Men film when we see that boy in a Nazi camp in Poland it is the same scene from the first X-men Bryan Singer directed. X-men First Class is the best prequel movie that explains the X-men characters and their universe with a good back story. Vaughn struck gold casting McAvoy and Fassbender as Young Professor X and Magneto, these two stole the show, especially Fassbender as Magneto, he was amazing... X-Men First Class also had a great supporting cast with Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, and January Jones. We are also introduced to a lot of new comers that played their roles perfectly.. The plot is pretty simple; we see how Charles and Erik meet and deal with their powers that they aren't comfortable dealing with because they are afraid society won't accept them, We also get to see how they eventually choose sides between good and evil! Which is very exciting, I know a lot of people (true Comic book readers) had issues with the actual choices of the First Class characters, but the ending of this movie will set up for those wanted characters to be in the sequel I'm sure, so hopefully the fanboys will ease up a little bit once production gets going on that! X-Men First class is up their as a top Comic Book movie adaptation and shouldn't be overlooked by anybody who is uneasy because of the past screw ups in the franchise. Just see this already if you haven't. I love this origin film, the acting in here is superb, the action scenes are awesome. I love that the plot I set in 1962, that you can see Las Vegas in here. I love that Eric and Charles are getting all the mutants together in battle against Sebastian Shaw. There is Beast for the first time in it. We last saw him in X-Men: Last Stand.Showing Magneto's strength and powers what he can do is amazing. Matthew Vaughn did an awesome job as director of X-men he did amazing job directing my all time favorite film Kick-Ass (2010.)X-Men First Class is easily the best of the entire series. The movie is high-tech and well-acted, with lots of action and noise as it portrays the origins of the X-Men, a group of about a dozen mutants (so far). It begins in a Nazi prison camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is forced to witness a tragedy and finds he can control metals with his mind — but only when he's angry. He grows up to become Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the lean Irish actor who the buzzmeisters say will become a big star from this film. Heaven help him. He was so good in ""Fish Tank,"" ""Inglourious Bastards"" and ""Jane Eyre"" (2011): must he play Magneto to become a star? For that matter, Raven/Mystique is played by Jennifer Lawrence, just nominated for a best actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The price of stardom.I love the plot on how they blend those characters from the beginning till those moments where you should be like ""whoa its that it for him?"" but its nice. Also I'm into the acting of the characters and damn kudos to Kevin Bacon & Michael Fassbender for just an awesome job on how they deliver the script into those characters. I mean just a big credit to those guys. The special effects are just awesome to the film as expected especially on the climax part. I love X-Men: First Class to death one of the best films ever made! Following the classic Marvel mythology, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together with other mutants some familiar, some new, to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.X-Men: First Class is a 2011 American superhero film, based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the X-Men film series. It serves as a prequel of the franchise. The film was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Marvel Entertainment, Dune Entertainment Starring: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, January Jones, Nicholas Hoult, Oliver Platt, Jason Flemyng, Lucas Till, Edi Gathegi, Kevin Bacon Director Matthew Vaughn Screenplay: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 12 Mins.

"X-Men: First Class","Hellmant","7 June 2011","'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Prequel to the other four 'X-MEN' films detailing the origins of the first 'X-Men' team (in 1962) and focusing primarily on the friendship, that later turned to rivalry, between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (who later became known as Professor X and Magneto).  The film was directed and co-written by Matthew Vaughn (also well known for adapting another popular comic book to film, 'KICK-ASS').  The script was also worked on by five other writers including Bryan Singer (the filmmaker behind the first two, much more loved, 'X-MEN' films), who was also set to direct this film before taking a producing seat instead in order to helm another project.  The movie stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones and Nicholas Hoult.  It's not quite as good as the first two installments but it is far superior to the last two.  Despite a somewhat rocky start it's an extremely satisfying and entertaining thrill ride that is sure to please most die-hard fans of the comics and movie series.The film opens with a scene from the first 'X-MEN' movie in which Erik is a child in a German concentration camp in 1944 and bends a metal gate, using his mutant ability to control metals, in an attempt to free his parents.  A scientist named Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) witnesses this and while trying to provoke the boy's power murders his mother.  Several years later Erik (Fassbender) is now obsessed with revenge.  While trying to murder Shaw he teams up with Xavier (McAvoy), the worlds most powerful telepath, who teaches him to harness his inner rage and better control his powers.  The two lead a team of young gifted mutants such as themselves in conjunction with the CIA.  Their ideas on what's best for their kind of course clashes and eventually challenges their friendship.The film is not as fun as the other installments, it's slower paced and extremely moody, but it is more serious and in many ways more faithful to it's source material. There are several inconsistency flaws with the other film chapters (if you thought the 'STAR WARS' prequels were bad, they're nothing compared to this) which is why many fans thought the filmmakers should have done a completely new reboot rather than a prequel. The inconsistencies don't really effect the overall quality of the film though. Once again they tried to pack too many characters and too many major events into one film and it's far too convoluted at times, early on, but it does pick up and get better as the film goes along.  The major characters are well thought out and relatable. The film, as with the entire series, grapples with the difficult society challenges faced with being an individual and different than the norm. This is where the movie is the strongest in many ways (as with the early two films), battling discrimination is a very emotional and serious topic for many and this chapter once again does an admirable job relating the issue. The action is of course stellar as well and Vaughn is once again in top form behind the camera. The performances are impressive all around once again as well, especially Fassbender, who's a star to watch out for. I'm becoming a big fan of Lawrence and she's good in this movie but it's hardly comparable to her Oscar nominated work from last year (in 'WINTER'S BONE'). Still it's nice to see her giving any of her talents to a comic book fanboy film like this. There's some nice surprise cameos as well. The film is pretty much grade A material all around. The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased with anything that isn't the page reincarnated panel by panel on the big screen but most fans should be thrilled.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1S3pjephF8","

"X-Men: First Class","bob the moo","30 September 2012","Having paid more than my fair share of inflated cinema tickets to see hyped blockbuster movies based on special effects, I'm more and more happy to wait rather than go sit in a crowded noisy room to see the latest one, which is why I decided to watch the recent X-Men reboot/prequel on DVD rather than in the cinema. I had heard reasonable things though, so I was quite looking forward to it and hoping that the franchise reboot would do more than simply move earlier in the story. I may have hoped this but of course this is not really what it does – the step back in time simply presses the reset button on the characters so the writers no longer need to worry about the back-story of the previous films. This may sound cynical but this is what the film is doing – not adding anything by the shift in time, just getting rid of expensive actors, messy plots and also getting viewers back into the cinema after the third film started to put them off.How much of a problem is this lack of innovation? Well, to be honest, not much if you are coming to the film knowing what you're getting into. What this means is that this is not a film that is exploring characters because it wants to – it is building characters because it wants to sell tickets and that is clear from the start since everything is pretty basic on the character side – indeed it never feels more relaxed than when it is able to go into a montage and develop characters that way. The good side of this is that it does want to spend lots of money on special effects and mostly these are up on the screen in rather silly and overblown effects shots. The various powers of the characters are where these effects come into play and they are as variable as the powers; so in some cases the effects are impressive and add to the action of the scene – in other cases no amount of effects can make the powers be good (a stripper with wings isn't a ""power"", it simply means she might get more tips). The plot does allow for plenty of good action even though the plot is pretty much the same one all the films have at their core – it really doesn't do much more than provide a frame.The new cast never quite get to the level of the adult equivalents, even though there is some real talent here. McAvoy and Fassbender both do solid work in their roles but they fall awkwardly between being younger as characters while also trying to have the gravitas of their previous versions. Bacon is OK but never as much of a threat as he needed to be while January Jones just strides round in her pants, presumably wondering how many years of really good turns she has to give in Mad Men before someone else will give her a good role. Lawrence, Bryne, Hoult and others are all OK in their roles but the downside of all these younger actors is that this doesn't feel like a big franchise sequel/prequel so much as it feels like a cheaper version of the proper films.That said it still delivers what it needs to do – which is special effects that provide value for money. The plot and characters don't offer much more than a frame for these, but they are not awful, just obvious. A solid big-budget superhero movie then, but not one that does much more than the minimum in regards plot, characters and tone.","

"X-Men: First Class","bretttaylor-04022","15 July 2023","Reboot's and prequels rarely work.X-Men had became a mess and this was probably the best way to save the franchise.Set in the 60's where Xavier and Magneto first meet and start recruiting other mutants to help them.All the characters are better than their originals including the two main ones.It is a bit silly at times, especially the ridiculous technology, but you are willing to accept it.Kevin Bacon is also surprisingly good as the villain.The seeds are planted well for continuation with the split between Xavier who wants to work and live alongside humans and Magneto who believes humans will try to destroy mutants and therefore need destroying.","

"X-Men: First Class","petsteph1","23 June 2011","Incredibly because I had read more than a dozen reviews on IMDb before I saw the movie and went in expecting to be very entertained. Every review said the same thing 'Great movie!' I settled back, a smile on my face, and after the first ten minutes I went 'Uh? Is this really the plot - that this mutant-powered kid after seeing his mother shot, and after trashing a room full of heavy metal objects, and after crushing two Nazi soldiers inside their helmets, DOESN'T at least try to kill the guy who killed his mother??"" Then it seemed to get worse. The acting was so bad that I was waiting for the joke to be sprung on me - this must be a play within a play, where the play within is really obviously poor...An hour later, remembering the glowing, enthusiastic reviews, I checked my ticket in case I was not seeing the same move. Then I told myself the second half must be amazing, how else could anyone admire this drivel? The costumes were embarrassing: they reminded me of an Austin Powers farce; the dialogue was so amazingly clichéd that I was guessing the next lines without effort, or error. The director seemed to be missing, presumed dead. The CGI was CGI; after the third time thru watching Raven turn on her blue-skin I was starting to think fondly of Transformers 3. The plot seemed to have been designed by a committee; I imagined a room full of brainstorming writers saying things like 'Wait! let's put Kennedy in there? We got any footage? Cuban Missile Crisis!"" ""Right! hey we need some really heavy type Russian general types, like in Dr. Strangelove only different."" ""Yeah, and lets put a twist in there where after the mutants have saved humanity, all the ships, get this Russian AND American, blow them to smithereens for no apparent reason."" ""Oh yeah, I love it!"" After what I was sure had been 2 hours I ran from the theatre as the credits rolled. I was amazed to find it had only been about 100 minutes. Time flies when you're having fun, and drags when you're not.My 17 year old son loved it. When I told him I thought it was stunningly bad he asked me if I was in a bad mood. I didn't feel in a bad mood, although my mood had been better when I bought my ticket. I said, ""No, I don't think so. I just think it was a very poor movie. I think it's INCREDIBLE that IMDb had so many positive reviews. In fact, I feel a bit strange about that."" That's the incredible part.","

"X-Men: First Class","son_of_cheese_messiah","28 August 2014","X-Men: First Class is a typically slick product of modern Hollywood; well made in its own way, but rather flat. It is one of those films that the more you think about it, the worse it becomes. Things happen because they look 'cool' in the moment rather than make sense.Nice to see what David Cameron was up to in his Bullindon Club days before he became UK Prime Minister. James McAvoy does an astonishingly good impersonation of him, only more slippery and creepy, if that's possible. But it seems to undermine the great Professor X that he should be using his telepathy to seduce girls, something of a low trick and one that cannot be merely dismissed as youthful high jinks. Perhaps he should call himself Professor Sex instead.I can certainly see why fans of the comic are appalled by the lack of fidelity to the original but I can also see why the film makers would want to go their own way. It is amazing, however, that they would choose such a crew of c-listers (with a few z-listers), some of whom are very little known even among comic fans. And like many badly written films, it leaves more questions than answers.Why was Havok chosen in preference to his brother Cyclops? Who are Angel and Darwin? Considering this is a PG-13, isn't the level of violence very disturbing, especially the slo-mo murder of Sebastian Shaw at the end, but also the indiscriminate killing of humans in the compound? Why would Shaw take the time and trouble to break into the compound, mass murdering people, say to the mutants ""you're either for us or against us"" then leave with only one mutant (the feeblest one at that) leaving these potential enemies alive? He even makes it even worse by killing one of them for little reason thus angering the rest? Why for that matter is the one black character in the film seem there merely to be killed off as quickly as possible? He seems to go unmourned by the x-men as do the humans in the compound. Why is the potential massacre of sailors at the end seen as worse than this actual massacre in the compound which the X-men do nothing about? Why does Mystique walk away from her oldest friend (Professor X) when he's just been crippled? It probably says a lot for the banality of the script that just about the last line in the film is David Cameron saying ""I can't feel my legs"".","

"X-Men: First Class","NORTHPOINTMJM","14 June 2011","After seeing this wonderful film I have to ask one question... can certain fanboys please shut up now about how this thing differs from their comic books? Apparently, a few fans couldn't leave their own expectations, cartoons and comic books at home. Too bad they assume ""they're doing it wrong"" by judging the film they see versus the one that's running in their fanboy head. Maybe that matters to a few but when the people involved deliver such an outstanding movie, does it really matter? Bring on Scott, Jean and Ororo in the sequel and in Xavier's true solo ""first class."" A movie this good is guaranteed at least a few sequels. Personally, I love this movie. It rivals X2 as the best of the bunch. The tone was breathtakingly perfect. Setting it in the early 60's was brilliant. This gives the film something no one really has seen before in these type of films and certainly elevates it from the X-Trilogy. As a fan of that trilogy, it is everything I was hoping for and maybe a bit more. This is the Xavier and Magneto story everyone has wanted to see since X1 and it's done remarkably well. There's no question that this film is going to surprise the doubters and frustrate the haters. There's no way anyone could hate anything about this movie unless they went in to view it wanted to hate on it. Wonderful in every way.","

"X-Men: First Class","kidlantern67","10 June 2011","I went to see X-Men: First Class on Saturday afternoon with my lovely wife. As the end credits rolled a sense of real satisfaction from watching an incredibly solid film washed over me. I liked the movie a ton but would my wife feel the same? She hasn't read many comics and doesn't follow the exploits of most superheroes. In other words, she represents the general audience when it comes to superhero fare. The film was able to garner high praise from her with the epic statement, ""If you see the guy in our building who sells bootleg DVDs and if he's got X-Men: First Class, buy it. I want to see it again."" Now kiddies, I by no means condone or comply with the purchasing of pirated videos. I categorically do not! But if that is your cup of tea who am I to judge. But the fact that my wife a non-comic book fan was totally enthralled and entertained by this film is no small feat. I know I annoy the hell out of her with my fan boy rants and ravings, but she tolerates it because she loves me. Aw! But I digress. X-Men: First Class hit so many nails on the head it should apply for a carpentry license. The casting of James McAvoy as Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto originally drew some skepticism from this humble reviewer. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian MacKellen seemed to be born to play the roles they made even more famous in the previous three X-Men films. How could McAvoy and Fassbender top these fine thespians? They didn't top them but they definitely matched them. McAvoy, who was told not to do a Stewart impersonation, gave the role of young Professor X a sense of joy, wonderment and hope that Stewart's portrayal lacked; which isn't knocking Stewart, by no means. X-men: First Class portrays a Charles Xavier before he became wheelchair-bound, so of course his world would seem a little brighter and rose-colored. McAvoy pulls off this Pollyanna portrayal with perfect aplomb. McAvoy is one of the best young actors of our time. He is solid in everything he does. See Wanted, Atonement and The Last King of Scotland to see how good he is.Michael Fassbender's portrayal as Magneto, Master of Magnetism, is spot on. While Sir Ian played Magneto as a man full of pi$$ and vinegar that has seen it all, Fassbender meanwhile plays the future villain exactly the same but with a little bit more gravitas and pathos. Fassbender's portrayal is so human you can't help but like his Erik. Even as Magneto's quest for revenge begins to take permanent root, gut- wrenchingly you begin to actually root for the man even though you know he will become the murderously human-hating purveyor of Superiority. Director Matthew Vaughn masterfully weaves a tapestry of swinging 1960's James Bond-like intrigue, Munich-style man-hunting and Marvel Comics mayhem with pitch perfect plot and pacing. Together, this becomes a crazy quilt of must-see appeal. Vaughn shows us three dimensional characters that we want to know even more about. Because of his direction and assist with the script, Vaughn gives us a Mystique we never saw in the first three films. She goes from partially- clad set piece to full-fledged character as portrayed by Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence. When I first heard about Kevin Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw, I must admit it gave me pause. I was like, ""Mr. Footloose himself playing one of the nastiest X-Men villains of all time? No way""! But after seeing X- Men: First Class, my world view was a little shaken. Now Bacon is a great actor, we all know this, but sometimes folks are miscast; Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman anyone? After seeing Bacon do his version of a Bond villain I had to admit it; he did his thing! That's a term used in around the neighborhood. With his mutant ability to absorb energy, Bacon's Shaw absorbed our attention with his slick oiliness every time he was on screen. Honorable mentions go out to Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and January Jones (wooden acting didn't bother me here) as Emma Frost for their performances. It was cool to see Moira finally fleshed out by a capable actress in Byrne. And Hoult was nerdy-fun as hairy Hank McCoy. Hopefully we'll see more of this actor in the future. Other X-Men, Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Havok (Lucas Till) are given appropriate screen time and give the film much needed comedy relief. Make sure you see the mutant gathering montage in the middle of the movie. There are some mutant cameos not to be missed; one in particular is laugh out loud funny.X-Men: First Class is definitely on the level of X2 and easily surpasses the miss that was X-3. Although X-Men: First Class, plays fast and loose with not only the comics' continuity but the previous movies as well, I suggest checking that simple fact at the door when seeing this film. I know there will be Hardcore fans who won't be able to get past that but please get over yourself otherwise you will be missing one of the better superhero films ever made.","

"X-Men: First Class","tpaladino","16 July 2011","Seriously. Where are all the good reviews coming from? Yeah it was cool to see Xavier and Magneto as young people. Yeah the Cold War storyline was interesting and had a ton of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was utterly squandered in an absolute mess of sloppy filmmaking. Rather than write a long-winded, critical essay, I'll just make a list of the awfulness:1. Plot holes big enough to drive an aircraft carrier though. So Xavier has equipment that allows him to find mutants all over the country. And he finds a group of dumb, undisciplined kids with powers of varying uselessness. Dragonfly-stripper-girl? Really? 2. Absolutely useless and insulting cameo by Wolverine. In the horrible montage in which Xavier and Magneto go out searching for the useless mutants, they come across Wolverine sitting at a bar, who tells them to 'f*ck off' before they can get two words out, at which point they just turn right around and walk out. You'd think that they'd at least TRY to convince the one mutant on their list who has extensive military training and sharply-honed instincts to join them. And since Xavier has these telepathic abilities, he'd know that Wolverine is also involved with another secret military operation, a fact which juuuuuust might be of some use to him as he builds his team and looks for resources. 3. They fly around in a modified SR-71 with a big internal passenger bay and the ability to hover. Really? I know they're going for a period vibe, but they couldn't come up with something original instead of insulting our intelligence by using a famous aircraft design and bastardizing it in the most ridiculous way possible?4. Horrible CGI effects. Seriously, were the CGI guys from Babylon 5 the only ones available?5. Kevin Bacon. As a Nazi war doctor. Need I say more?6. Completely implausible and insulting reasons for Magneto and Mystique to flip on Xavier. Especially Mystique. 7. The fight between the mutants is probably the worst combat scene ever put on film. Literally.8. Did I mention Kevin Bacon? Yeah, because he and January Jones also start the Cuban Missile Crisis. 9. 1950's period setting is completely phony and feels totally tacked on. There's probably a lot more, but this is just what leaps to mind immediately. It was really THAT bad. I'm giving it four stars because the director managed to keep the boom microphones out of all the shots, and the camera upright. Also January Jones has a spectacular rack and the chick that played Mystique was cute as well.","

"X-Men: First Class","timbob82","7 June 2011","Rarely have I seen a film professing to be good that ended up being as bad as XMFC. The back story altogether was silly and not just written to be taking place in the 60s, but seemed to be written as if the writers were living in the 60s. There was soooo much cheesy and corny crap. The yacht that turns into a submarine, the overly trusting CIA that takes super-powered people and lets them run wild recruiting kids to be super-secret agents for the government (what is this, Spy Kids?), the bad guy with the secret passageways behind the bookshelf and the table that spins around when you touch the secret panel...I mean all of that late 60s/early 70s James Bond flotsam that no one ever really did or had, but was all part of the ""isn't this cool, daddio"" culture of the time and so popped up in every action movie. I was waiting for there to be a mad scientist with a death-ray on the moon. So much for Vaughn's determination to bring these characters into a realistic setting. Then, the most interesting characters were the ones most under-utilized. Havok, Banshee, Darwin, Azazel and Riptide were completely glossed over in favor of the already over-exposed characters. People complain about the X-films over using Wolverine and that they are tired of it? Well, absent him, who are the two characters most heavily utilized in the X-films? Magneto (the ever-villain, whose constant inclusion negates the use of far more interesting villains) and Xavier. The other two character focal points, Mystique and Beast, have also been done. So anyone hoping for some good character exposition on the new blood...sorry, you are S.O.L. Nothing here but the same old, same old. But then, on the topic of the characters who actually did get exposition... --Magneto. You get his initial entrance into the concentration camp, and then he is 30. 12 to 30...just like that. What happened in between? What happened between when he got liberated and the first scene with him in the hotel room spinning the coin round his fingers? It was bad story telling. They wanted him to be completely unencumbered with a job, friends, a home...anything that would ground his character in reality. They wanted him to be a clean slate of a character with one thing only: revenge on Shaw. Talk about a one-dimensional character. Plus, his turn-coat to being a bad guy was practically instantaneous. Yeah, he and Xavier had that very brief convo about mutants/humans sitting across the chess board, but that was really it. Then, a few meglo-maniacal words from Shaw in the reactor room and Magneto is ready to turn coat on the only people in his entire life that he has ever been able to call friend. Almost as silly as Darth Vader's turn in Episode III. --Mystique...same exact problem. Her brother, best friend, only person in the world she really cares about. Not only does she betray his dream, not only does she go against every other one of her friends, but she up and leaves Xavier shot and possibly dying. I'd be one thing if she were a stalwart ""mutant and proud"" booster from the start, but she has only ever wanted to be normal and has known love, friendship and acceptance and she immediately turns away from her entire life and the beliefs she has had her whole life after a few kind words from a guy she threw herself at (who ultimately rejected her advances, btw). Her turn was sillier than Magneto's. At least he had the bad childhood to fall back on. --Shaw. His motivation was wholly unbelievable. He was a completely one-dimensional villain. Why exactly did he want to do what he was planning? Here he is, a wealthy and powerful man who has never known anti-mutant prejudice due to his ability to pass for a human, as well as the fact that there was no anti-mutant prejudice at this time since mutants were an, as yet, undiscovered species. And yet, he is looking to destroy all of humanity. Oh yeah, and exactly how were the mutants to survive the nuclear holocaust? I don't recall anyone claiming all mutants were immune to radiation poisoning. So he was just a cartoonish Bond villain with no reasoning behind his motivation. So characters were bad, style and execution of the plot was bad, action and FX were Michael Bay-esque in that it was random explosions and jump cuts that had too many things happening too fast to make an impact. Clichéd training montages. Terrible effects on Beast. Silly one-dimensional human characters. Some of the acting was passable, but some was flat out bad (January Jones, the Kravitz girl) and the ones that were good were really just OK. No stand out performances. And even if Fassbender and Macavoy could be seen as great, they weren't so good that the entire movie can hang on their performances. Frankly, I think this film is a beneficiary of its own hype. Maybe a lot of critics who grew up in the 60s/70s were swept up in the nostalgia for their lost childhood and looked fondly on this film because of it. High critical praise and constant...never...ending...PROMOTION for weeks had people hypnotized into thinking this movie's release was going to be the event of all events. I think it got to a point where the people who were moderately excited about its release started hyping themselves up more and more at every positive review and every new trailer. Every new viral character spotlight and every crossover (come on...a Statefarm Insurance crossover?!?). Eventually, they just told themselves that this was the movie of the year and, for those people, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd recommend passing on this one. Hopefully, they will reboot the whole series and make an X-Men movie that does the characters justice.","

"X-Men: First Class","Vezon123","4 June 2011","In fact, the fact that the highest ratings of the movie titles with ""X-Men"" can not inspire the viewer, whose goal in going to the movies - a bucket of popcorn, cold ""Cola"" and lots of positive emotions directly from the spectacle, which he expects to receive . At the same time there were fears that the movie can be a tedious and cloying, especially after the promises made by Matthew Vaughn from the movie to make complicated mix of youth melodrama, like ""Twilight,"" and other things, that so typical of the summer blockbuster. However, all expectations after the scene display their talents Eric were some dull, useless, because the movie - it's not just action and melodrama, it is also an element of culture, an element that can, if desired to embody anything.Rant on the topic of how good the story was not worth it, because he's really good, but no more. It has some inconsistencies and small plot ""appendixes, but they do not do anything wrong the general concept for how to write off all at the expense of"" the starting point ""and the fact that this film adaptation of comic books, comic books, moreover, is not the most famous Russian public, it turns pretty easy. No, nothing delusional and objectively excess is not observed, but difficult to call all of these plot moves riding genius. The script just fine. More precisely, even so: is simple, because even good.Everything goes through some sort of unwritten plan, as usual, and I must say, very confidently. Sometimes even a thought that, come this tape years ago, eleven commercials, will it be now, if not universally accepted classics of the genre, or at least included in the list of his rules.In ""First Class"" There is nothing flowery and, often, fills all the empty space. All lines are the heroes have a logical ending, and perhaps that's why nice to watch all this action. Yes, of course, who would be there that may say, but the pathos is also present, but, in fact, it strongly enough in comparison with many similar bands, and when it is, the characters seem even heartier, perhaps, may have even some on-screen life is waking up.All this, of course, is not very easy and very pleasant to an eye a couple of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Their duet looks as organically and naturally, because guys are not devoid of distinctive features and play their characters with great devotion, that neither can not affect the overall level of acting. Just a little surprised by the ease McAvoy, but this is the surplus of the image, not otherwise. Fassbender is, in fact, magnificent, and I say this almost without exaggeration. His image is powerful, hot, passionate and extremely interesting artistically.Mummery excellent main characters and a good story canvas strengthened and that the action as the main driving element of most summer blockbusters, which, incidentally, ""X-Men"" could be considered with interest, looks almost the most minor details of the painting. Yes, everything is done at the highest level and the director of most scenes you can put a solid ""five"", but ""First Class"" is surprisingly skillfully won it on the feelings of the characters, not how beautiful or, conversely, they are operating their awful abilities.In general, turned abruptly on all sides. Tape is without doubt a good and attractive, but in this case, probably all. It seeks not to be supersereznoy and raise topics that she does not pick up on the forces, and this is its main advantage. ""First Class"" - a reference sample of summer blockbuster, which must appeal to many. It's simple and delicious. In the film, there is nothing complicated and abstruse, and the curse for this Matthew Vaughn makes no sense. Bright, interesting, funny and very, very pleased to see the old-new characters in the new-old guise. Only Logan is not changed.","

"X-Men: First Class","Meven_Stoffat","3 June 2011","I grew up with the X Men cartoons- ah, the childhood memories. I remember reading the comics and wishing I was as cool as Magneto, Wolverine, Beast, etc. I remember when X Men 1 came out... and oh man it was F'ing cool. I wanted to be like Wolverine. I loved that Cyclops' name was Scott. I got it on VHS for Christmas and I was 9 years old. I think I nearly wore out the tape!!! X2 was probably the best of the original trilogy, in my opinion. It was the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd pleasing. When X3 came out, I was excited... but was so disappointed when I went and saw it. What happened? Who were all these random mutants??? What purpose did they serve? Why was all this story crammed in? And X Men Origins ran the franchise even further into the ground. Quite frankly I was done with the X Men franchise by then.And then, ANOTHER X Men movie gets made. Oh dear. A PREQUEL???? George Lucas made 3 tragedies that were prequels. But wait... Michael Fassbender is in it, as is James MacAvoy!!! And it's directed by Matthew Vaughn. That's when I decided, OK, I'll start taking this movie seriously now. And then I saw the trailer... I was excited... This is the X Men I want to see.And believe me. This movie ROCKED. Me being the geek I am, I went and saw it today. And trust me, it does NOT disappoint! X2 was my favorite of the series, but it looks like I have to reconsider. I'm not kidding, this movie is what I wanted to see after X2. This is, as I stated, a prequel. The first half may disorient you a little- it focuses mainly on Erik and Charles. We learn of Erik's childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, and how he came to terms with his magnetic powers. Whereas Charles, the man with clearly the better childhood, comes to terms with his mind reading abilities. We follow them through thick and thin- Charles' academic ventures and relationship with Raven and Erik's vengeful outings. We do see them meet, one night when Erik unsuccessfully tries to stop Sebastian Shaw, the film's villain, and his crew.This leads to the meetings with a few Youth with mutant powers. Raven, who can turn into another person easily is automatically in, we have a scientist with feet that can grab, a woman with firefly wings, A man with a sonar, a man who can adapt, another man who can wreak havoc with some destructive powers. This leads to Charles' creation of a school for these people, so they can prepare for their part in the Cuban Missile Crisis- a crisis fronted by Shaw.Honestly... wow. I can't believe I actually liked a new X Men movie for once. At 132 minutes, not a single moment is wasted. The movie moves at an effective enough pace- equal amounts of action and character are to be found. There is a lot of great humour too, and the climax in Cuba is one intense nail biter. And they managed not to screw up the character arcs- except the fact that Charles loses his walking ability in the 60s yet at the beginning of X3 he can be seen standing. But that movie fracked lots of arcs up anyways, so I don't count it.The acting is PHENOMENAL. Fassbender gives quite possibly the performance of a lifetime. His controlled rage and mannerisms are just... BRILLIANT. He manages to nail the role completely and carry the film in the palm of his hand. MacAvoy surprised me big time here as well and excelled as Charles. And Kevin Bacon was fantastic as Shaw. Honestly I can't think of a single bad performance, all were great.In short, this film is the movie that defines ""Awesome summer movie"". It is the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd-pleasing. Even if you don't like X-Men you will still love this movie. By far the best movie of 2011!!!OVERALL: 10/10PROS: -Awesome script -Lots of action -Amazing performances -Great pacing -Not a second wastedCONS: -...uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh...","

"X-Men: First Class","jon.h.ochiai","5 June 2011","Passionate James McAvoy as Charles Xavier implores his dear friend Erik Lehnsherr (sullenly charismatic Michael Fassbender) to let go and harness his innate power, ""True focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity."" ""X-Men: First Class"" is about rediscovering one's power and choosing one's life path. In ""First Class"" the difference between the hero and the villain may be choice. Director and Writer Matthew Vaughn's ""X-Men: First Class"" has unexpected pathos. Set in 1962 ""X-Men: First Class"" compellingly tells the origins of the X-Men mythology. This is surprising given the numerous writers involved: Ashely Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Sheldon Turner, and Bryan Singer (writer and director of the first two X-Men movies). Singer's signature narrative strands resonate here. Charles rescues Erik, who almost forfeits his life all for vengeance, reminding him, ""You are not alone!"" For Singer, ""X-Men"" has always been his allegory of courage in the face of prejudice and fear. In ""X-Men"" Mutants, ""Children of the Atom"", are born with special powers. Consequently, neither Human, Mutants are feared and forced to conceal, who they are. Like all discriminated, Mutants have lost the freedom to be. Although with some whimsical patches, ""X-Men: First Class"" is amazingly somber. Its gravitas sources the period, 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Vaughn authentically recreates 1962. ""X-Men: First Class"" has a retro James Bond look and feel. The art deco lines are elegantly clean. The wardrobe has slender lines and muted tones. Unlike other X-Men movies, this one is sexy. Vaughn has January Jones and Rose Byrne in cool 60's lingerie, in context of course. He even inserts the benign homage to ""Basic Instincts"" with stunning Jones. ""First Class"" is visually stunning. At the spectacular story arc Erik (Fassbender), harnessing his power, lifts a submerged submarine into the sky.On the downside ""X-Men: First Class"" has at least two too many mutants and subplots. They are distracting. The power of ""First Class"" lies in the relationship and transformation of Charles and Erik. McAvoy and Fassbender embody a formidable force. We are invested in their chosen fate. James McAvoy at first occurs as Harry Potter playing Xavier. He is deceptive in his compassion and strength. Unintentionally, he is the critical foil of the dominant dark presence of Erik. Through McAvoy's undying belief in the vestiges of nobility in Erik, we witness the tragic fall. Charles pleads with Erik, ""Killing will not bring you peace."" Erik reminds, ""Peace was never an option."" Fassbender is powerful. He is going to be a big star. As Erik, he compassionately leverages his pain and rage. Fassbender brilliantly hints at Erik's innate nobility and the cost of his forfeited humanity. Ultimately, Erik's fall from grace occurs when he succumbs to vengeance. To that end, Kevin Bacon is amazing as Sebastian Shaw, the man who created and cursed Erik. Bacon is awesome and convincing in his malevolent presence.""X-Men: First Class"" recreates the opening of ""X-Men"". It is Poland 1944, young Erik is separated from his family as they are taken to the Nazi gas chambers. Immersed in fear and rage, Erik discovers his Mutant power over metal as he effortlessly twists the steel fence. Nazi scientist Shaw (Bacon) recognizes Erik's gift. In unspeakably ruthless act, Shaw coerces Erik to summon his power. Erik's life becomes ruled by vengeance. Back in wealthy English estate, we learn that young Charles is a telepath of uncharted ability. Not only can he read minds, he can also manipulate them. He befriends a fellow Mutant in Raven, a blue skinned shape shifter. Charles takes her in as his sister. Beautiful Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven as the young woman she becomes.Charles and Erik's lives follow apparently divergent paths. Now 18 years later, Erik searches for Shaw in Argentina. Charles is at Oxford University with Raven. He is finishing his doctorate on human mutation. However one move ahead, Shaw is in Las Vegas generating his master plan to ignite World War III. CIA operative Moira MacTaggert (spunky Rose Byrne) witnesses Shaw in surveillance of Hell Fire Club. Byrne provides great spirit as Moira. Requiring expertise on Mutants, Moira seeks out Charles. Charles knowingly aligns forces with the CIA to bring Shaw to justice. This leads to the inevitable collision with Erik's path of vengeance. Vaughn masterfully orchestrates the tragic hero story and world brinkmanship.There are so many Mutants on both sides of the fight. January Jones makes a seductive turn as Emma Frost, a telepath who can transform to diamond. Nicholas Hoult is strong as the angst ridden and innocent scientist Hank McCoy. The other X-Men classmates are cool, but get lost in the noise. Jennifer Lawrence brilliantly fleshes out Raven, who comes to terms with her own identity and leverages the plot tipping point.""X-Men: First Class"" lives and dies in the brotherhood of Charles and Erik in the battle of good and evil. Through the performances of McAvoy and Fassbender, the lines are poignantly blurred. Triumph is solemn, and the fall from grace is tragic. ""X-Men: First Class"" may be the best X-Men movie. And it is just a great movie.","

"X-Men: First Class","chico-ortiz","13 June 2011","Don't know where to begin, this was such a bad, cheesy, lame film! - and I'm an X-Men fan. The previous 3 seemed to have some intelligence, but this seems like it was made by some dumb-ass kid. I can't believe how many good reviews this has when almost everything about it was so poor.The acting: overwrought and embarrassing (especially January Jones who was like a Playboy bunny just learning to act).The characters: Prof. X - why the hell is he English all of a sudden? - was like a creepy, cheesy, horny David Cameron (which can never be appealing). Nothing like his character in the comics or other films - just bad and embarrassing. Magneto's accent came and went as it pleased (and I'm not even sure if it was ever supposed to be there, or what it was supposed to be), and he was as interesting as a piece of wood. Banshee was American, not Irish; Moira McTaggart was American, not Scottish. Unrealistic motivations and actions abound. The Beast's costume looked like Wolverine has rolled around in some blue fur and glue. Otherwise, it's a like a catwalk of one beautiful, posturing teen after another: every person, every random mutant, had to be young, beautiful, ripped, sexy - even if they were previously cab drivers or whatever. Totally unrealistic and all about image consciousness (ironic for the heavy-handed message about Mystique accepting herself).The structure: a lot of running around aimlessly, with one anti-climax after another.The setting: supposed to be early, pre-hippy 60s, but often came off like mid-late 60s, as if the set/costume/music people were a bunch of ignorami who just thought 'cool- 60s, mod, James Bond, shagadelic'. Really, really lame.The sexism: women are mainly there for eye candy, and to be models of insecurity, and any excuse to show them in lingerie, in strip clubs, T&A close-ups etc. is greedily taken. Emma Frost is instructed by Magneto to go get her some ice, and she does so like an obedient servant. Angel and her fellow prostitutes are all beautiful, happy and fit, willing servants for the pleasures of men - not depressed, shaking, acne-scarred women debasing themselves to feed their families or their habits. Really irresponsible film-making - and before anyone says ""lighten up, it's just a movie"", remember that the comics were really good - and realistic - about social issues (despite the women's skimpy costumes!).The racism: I can't believe reviewers haven't mentioned this - in a scene where Kevin Bacon says to Darwin (who is black), ""So you have two choices, you can do nothing with your powers and be enslaved..."" and at the word 'enslaved' the camera does a close-up on Darwin for a long few seconds... reinforcing the equation of black man = slave. Maybe the heavy-handed director was trying to suggest that Darwin would naturally relate to Bacon's speech given his race's history... but a few minutes later he's killed! - the old movie cliché' that the black man is always the first to die, once again! Truly an appalling piece of film-making, and not worth the half-price tickets I paid for.","

"X-Men: First Class","ThomasMagnumPI","9 June 2011","MARVEL is definitely on a roll! It all started with the huge success of X-Men over a decade ago. So, it's fitting the high water mark comes this summer with X-Men First Class right in the middle of it. Thor was great earlier this summer and Captain America looks even better. Iron Man and the Hulk kicked butt recently. So, if Marvel gets their hired out characters rolling, the sky is the limit. I don't know about Sony's Spider-Man but Fox managed to return the X-Men to greatness. Can't wait to see what Fox does with the next Wolverine and the whole world is eagerly awaiting the Avengers to assemble! One of the best improvements about First Class over X-Men is that much valuable screen time is spent on background character development. They actually pick up from the scene of young Magneto shown in X-Men. I believe that was probably needed in the first film, but they had so much else to introduce that they got away with showing much less. That's the beauty of this film and now I see why they choose to save Scott, Jean and Storm's introduction for future films. Taking the proper time to establish Charles and Erik was a must and it is very well done. Even in X2, the newer characters that were introduced got very little time devoted to their past. It worked but the way new characters are introduced here works better. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information in general. Some of that is on display here but they truly flesh out the characters that need it the most. Apparently the director figured out this delicate balance because First Class flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the action but still delivering an intelligent and moving film.","

"X-Men: First Class","rparham","3 June 2011","Typically when a film franchise decides to move into prequel territory, it rarely bodes well for the quality of the final product. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, and X-Men: First Class is one of them. First Class brings the X-Men film franchise back from the land of mediocrity it seemed headed toward with the previous entry, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and manages to mine some strong character material by revisiting where everything began.X-Men: First Class opens in Poland in 1944 (and actually features footage from the original X-Men movie) in which we see young Erik Lensherr tortured by malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) where he learns to harness his magnetic powers, but only when put through severe emotional trauma. Meanwhile, in America Charles Xavier comes face to face with another mutant, Raven Darkholme, and his family takes her in as an adopted sister. 20 years later, Charles (James McAvoy) is studying for an advanced degree in genetics, Erik (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to exact revenge on Shaw, and the world at large is just becoming aware of the existence of mutants. Shaw is hatching a plan to turn humans against one another so he and other mutants can emerge victorious from the carnage if humanity goes to war with itself, and only Charles and Erik, who begin recruiting mutants to help them thwart Shaw's plan, stand between humanity and nuclear war.Many prequels exist simply to fill in the blanks between the known details of a franchise, and X-Men: First Class does tread some of that territory, as to be expected. But, for the most part, First Class works best when delving into the relationships between the characters who would be already established in the future X-Men films. The film focuses a fair amount of screen time on fleshing out Charles and Erik, as well as Charles and Raven, giving their interactions a degree of tragedy and pathos when viewed from the lens of the future. Raven, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, gets the majority of the depth that had not even really been hinted at in the other X-Men films, portraying her as someone who views Charles as much more than just an adopted brother, but also having to come to terms with the fact that her natural appearance, covered in blue scales, causes others, even Charles, to flinch, and she begins to realize that her path and Charles' will diverge in the future.One of the strengths of First Class is in the casting of Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. Bacon manages to deliver both a magnetic and threatening performance, someone who is always seemingly one step ahead of the people around him that he views as inferior to his evolved self. While Bacon is hardly restrained, he doesn't take Shaw over the top into the realm of parody or silliness. The other standout is the always engaging Michael Fassbender in the role of Erik. He embodies the rage and desire for revenge in Erik, on a mission to avenge his tragic past while also never trusting the humans surrounding him. When Fassbender is on screen, he commands the scene, and gives Erik a strong, memorable presence.Lest you think X-Men: First Class is all darkness and unhappiness, it actually has a rather light touch at times. Director Mathew Vaughan manages to infuse the proceedings often with, dare I say it, a sense of fun, especially in scenes where the various X-Men are learning to use and harness their powers. There is also a degree of homage in many scenes in the film, both to the era in which it is set, the swinging early '60s, and to films of that era (you can't watch the scenes set in the war room and not think of Dr. Strangelove). There is a bit of tweaking of stereotypes of that era, such as sexism and the intolerance that was beginning to melt off society as the decade progresses. X-Men: First Class is by no means perfect. In an attempt to hit many of the bases of setting up the future films, some elements feel a bit rushed and unexplored, glossed over instead of being given the room to breathe that it sometimes feels like it needs. Also, as with the initial three X-Men films, not all the characters are given the opportunity to be fully drawn, and some of the more peripheral characters are left underdeveloped.That said, X-Men: First Class performs what would almost seem a cinematic miracle: it manages to save a franchise that many had written off. It is unsure what the future holds for the X-Men films, but if a few more like First Class can be served up, then they will be worth watching.","

"X-Men: First Class","neil-476","2 June 2011","I don't want to rehash the plot of this X-Men origins movie - either you don't care because you're not interested, or you're looking forward to the movie and want to find out for yourself, or you're so keen to know that you've looked it up already. Suffice it to say that, like the best adaptations, there's enough of the original material to remain true to the spirit, but enough variation to keep you interested and surprised. It is a very satisfying story with - so importantly! - a very good script.The film is brilliantly cast and the performances are uniformly excellent, with the central performances of McAvoy and Fassbender being the note-perfect glue which holds the whole thing together (please excuse the mixed metaphor!). Jennifer Lawrence's Raven is also a creation of shifting emotional layers.The effects and set pieces are executed flawlessly, with the sole exception of Emma Frost changing back from diamond form, which doesn't really convince (neither does January Jones, who doesn't really convey very much of the Emma Frost I expected).There is a single, completely unnecessary, F-bomb.Overall, though, this film is great fun, terrifically entertaining, carries some emotional wallop, and has jumped straight to first place as my favourite X-Men film.","

"X-Men: First Class","DarthVoorhees","24 September 2011","I don't know what to think about 'X-Men First Class'. It's a film I've thought a great deal about because I am a fan of the comic book film genre and especially the X-Men. It's a film that has some great strengths but also a major problem which has been bothering me with repeat viewings of the film. There are moments in 'X- Men First Class' which match the best the comic book genre has to offer. Ultimately though the strengths and weaknesses of the film come from my favorite character of the series, Magneto.I believe Magneto might just be the best comic book character ever even rivaling Batman. If comic books are the modern day form of tragic melodrama than Magneto is the greatest character to come out of this idea. He is so compelling a character with such clear and cut motives and is in this case played so compellingly by Michael Fassbender in an absolutely brilliant performance that I think he really could have stood alone here. I would pay to see a picture of Magneto hunting down Nazi and developing his Mutant ideology, which I expect the proposed X-Men Origins Magneto would have dealt with. Fassbender is absolutely brilliant in the role. He exposes a vulnerability, frailty, and rage that really befits this great character. Through the course of the X-Men mythology I find myself agreeing with Magneto ideologically more so than Professor X and this film is no exception. Fassbender's performance is as good as anything we have ever seen in a comic book film maybe on par with some of the performances in 'The Dark Knight' if a comparison is needed.The problem is Professor X while we do get a great performance from James McAvoy comes across as weak. I find it kind of odd that someone like Xavier has the nads to give Magneto life lessons. While Xavier was picking up chicks awkwardly in the pub in England Magneto was in a quest for retribution. Xavier just kind of comes across as a spoiled brat in this film. He offers nothing to this partnership because Magneto is by far the more mature and learned character. McAvoy's Xavier spends a great deal of the film infatuated with a stupid cut out CIA character called Moira MacTaggert. Why? I don't know, she's so incredibly bland other than her groovy auburn hair. I don't identify with this Professor X in the least and the Mystique origin only adds to it. What kind of person would do that to his best friend and almost sister? McAvoy is less than subtle in showing Xavier's fear of Mystique's true nature. Perhaps showing Xavier's flaws was necessary in developing the character. I don't think any sensible audience member engaged in this story would choose Professor X over Magneto and the film asks you to pick a side in the sand. The choice is so incredibly clear here.And yet it isn't...unfortunately so. 'X-Men First Class' biggest problem is its ending and in order to give my opinion of the film I have to indulge in some pretty big spoilers. Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a really decent villain to a certain point. I love the fact that he is a Nazi. I love the fact that he plays the stupidity of the Cold War and American and Soviet representatives to his advantage. And what is more relevant is that he is the one who caused Magneto so much pain and shaped his views on humankind for the absolute worst. This really perfectly builds up to a final confrontation between Magneto and Shaw and what happens in this climactic moment? Shaw is given the entirety of Magneto's mantra to the point where Magneto's only retort is ""I agree with everything you just said but unfortunately you killed my mother""... this infuriated me as a viewer and fan of this character. Essentially you have throw away Magneto's entire motivation, his entire view of the world, his mission to save the mutants from another holocaust, and threw them away in favor of a really insignificant revenge story. I don't care about Magneto's mother other than the fact that her death made him see the world in a different light. What you do by giving Shaw Magneto's mantra is make the Magneto character useless. You say Magneto is no different than this sadist Nazi only he had to get rid of the person who killed his Mommy. No! I couldn't take that especially after Fassbender created such an interesting character. And the thing that gets me is that this could have been solved by making a few simple changes. Would it not make more sense for Shaw to be in it for himself? To have this new utopia from nuclear holocaust emerge with him as it's unquestionable leader? Wouldn't Shaw be even more evil if he wanted to rule OVER mutants instead of with them? Then Magneto could be vindicated in his wanting to protect his new found race with Xavier. You still could have Xavier and Magneto falling out over the same basic thing in the end and the movie would still work and even work better! I think I was more forgiving in the sense that I sought a sequel but I really doubt there will be one. McAvoy and Fassbender are too big stars to indulge an X-Men series. By the end of this film Magneto and Xavier have drawn their lines in the sand for good. I would have liked to have thought there would be more to this friendship that it could develop and nurture itself and eventually have a bad falling out. In essence Magneto and Xavier are the best of friends for two weeks and become enemies right away. Unfortunately and it is so disappointing to say Magneto's side is Shaw's side and he became everything he supposedly hated and that is tragic.","

"X-Men: First Class","bennyhagen","10 June 2011","X-Men: First Class pushes the envelope by further developing the present form of mainstream crap. The ""phylosophical themes"" featured by this talky little movie consist exclusively of stupid commonplace and the banal scenes illustrating the concept of separation and such run on kindergarten level. As a wise man once said: ""If you have nothing to say then just shut the f+*k up"". And yet again, not shown to you, like, visually, but talked about and explained verbally. Similar to Venezuelan soap opera. Let me just hand out a big f/ckyou here.Characters are superficial and underdeveloped. Except of somewhat competent James McAvoy actors seem uninspired. Dialog matches daytime drama standards and worse. Superpowers are just not cool and the visual execution seriously lacks fantasy. The fact that almost everything you see here has already been done in the previous x-men movies and in much cooler ways lets me reshape into a question mark. Visual design also lacks fantasy, some of it is horrible. The work of the department responsible for the make-up effects is atrocious, Beast and Mystique look like muppets. Here goes the other f*ckyou.Despite a Wolverine cameo logical connections to the former trilogy are missing completely. I didn't know this was a reboot but however, the question emerges, why rebooting something that has been decently executed before (let's forget about X3 for a minute here). Why destroying the former movies and make something even more remote to the comics? Surely it has to do with money, so let's bow before the gods of marketing.People in the cinema seemed to like it, I guess they found it awesome and intelligent. I have no doubt that anti-intellectual sh-*/t like this will continue setting standards and increasingly shape upcoming movies in it's own image as box office numbers show it is well matched to the demands of it's audience.2/10Whatever talented, passionate people might have accomplished throughout movie-making history, most successful production will always be the WWF.","

"X-Men: First Class","james_c9110","29 July 2011","Two years have gone by since the release of the last X film; X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This being the origin story of the franchise's most popular character, so naturally expectations were high. However, when the film turned out to be nothing more than an action flick lacking character development, story and general attention to detail many fans, including myself, felt cheated. Rumors of other Origin projects, this time focused on Magneto and Deadpool, took off and fizzled out as soon as X-Men First Class was announced. This at first seemed like a wild stab in the dark for the studio after Wolverine failed to deliver. However, it eventually became clear that it would fill in the history for several main characters at once; Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and Beast, as well as introducing several new heroes and villains to the screen. Sounds too good to be true right? Well fortunately, it isn't!This film may well be the best X-Men movie to date, rivaling only with X-Men 2. Finally there's something in this film that's been absent from the franchise for far too long: the ability to make us care about the characters. The majority of the film's characters are relatable and have their own personal conflicts such as insecurity, anger and loyalty. These are especially noticeable with James McAvoy's Professor X and Michael Fassbender's Magneto. Both actors have a brilliant fresh take on the characters. Professor X is far less serious than his previous portrayal. Yes he lectures students and advises the FBI, as you'd expect, but he's also out in the field fighting the bad guys with the rest of the team and is out drinking in bars when he's not on the job. He's young and it shows. Magneto here is vengeful, powerful but clearly human. He's been through some pretty dark stuff so has a right to be angry and Professor X knows this. These two together have great chemistry and their friendship feels real, even though we know that ultimately their views will separate them. The rest of the X-Men do get their time to shine, Mystique and Beast also deserve a mention for character chemistry, but they're all ultimately shadowed by Magneto and Professor X who seem to steal the show slightly. Although not all of First Class's villains are convincing, Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is casually brutal which really works for a threatening bad guy, and the bright red teleporting Azazel (yes, he is pretty much a red Nightcrawler) is pure ninja in a fight.Moving on to the action, the fights between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club are brilliant and even the training is great to watch. First Class really does have some great jaw dropper moments. Sadly the film does have a weakness, well, depending on how you look at it. First class doesn't quite seem to know where it stands with the other X-Men films in terms of continuity. Hence the term coined at the start of this review; pre-boot. I'm not going to list all the things that stop it from linking up with Origins: Wolverine or X3, but you might just have to pretend those films didn't happen for it to all make sense. Some of us already were anyway","

"X-Men: First Class","Christian_Dimartino","16 July 2011","I have been a hardcore X-men fan since the beginning of the series, so going into X-men: First Class I had unanswered questions. Why is Xavier in a wheel chair? Why are Magneto and him enemies? Thats the premise of the latest film, and director Matthew Vaughn answers all of the questions.James Mccavoy and Michael Fassbender are excellent choices for Xavier and Magneto. The film shows how they first met. Xavier was friends with Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) and he believed in the greater good. Magneto wasn't a bad person. He just wanted revenge on Sebastian(the wickedly evil Kevin Bacon), a Nazi who becomes too power mad.Magneto and Xavier team up together to make a mutant school, and with the help of a government agent(Rose Byrne), they try to take care of wrong doers, and well, The Cuban Missle Crisis believe it or not. And you are hooked.Vaughn takes the time to study the characters. Its the longest film in the series yet, and that because Vaughn has a lot of story to tell. The acting all around is triumphant, especially from McCavoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and Bacon. They bring depth to these characters, and you care about them deeply.I think that X-Men: First Class is the best X-men film yet, and I was pleasantly surprised because I thought it looked cheesy. But I really liked it. It answered all of the questions i've wanted answered since the beginning, and unlike X-men: The Last Stand, it takes its time getting to know the characters.Though I won't deny that it drags on a little, First Class is exciting and thrilling and is definitely one of the Summer's grandest films so far. X-men hasn't been better, and I liked every film so far. I hope Vaughn returns for another one, because if there's been five, there's got to be more where this came from.A-","

"X-Men: First Class","jessicareid","27 July 2013","I am a fan of Marvel in general and I loved all the previous X-Men films so I expected to enjoy this film anyway and had quite high expectations. It did not disappoint and is in fact my favourite film of the franchise. This is saying something considering the fact that Wolverine is my favourite X-Men character -although he does feature with an amusing cameo.One of the things I loved about this film was seeing the origins of many characters and seeing how relationships formed and developed. It was interesting to see the contrast in this film from the main three, particularly regarding Professor X and Magneto.The fact that this film is a prequel to the main films means that anybody could watch it and understand the story line. I definitely recommend this film to anyone and I think that those who would not normally watch this genre of film may be pleasantly surprised.","

"X-Men: First Class","PrincessTarah","27 June 2011","I definitely was not expecting this. After all the other X-Men movies being, well, what they were, I never thought that First Class would be this good. It did create some plot holes with the other movies, but they were minor, and I don't really care. The storyline was superb. It goes very deep and reveals the back stories of even the more mysterious characters. I was hooked about five minutes in. This is perhaps the best superhero movie I have ever seen. The acting was sensational. I especially liked Michael Fassbender as Eric/Magneto. He really made his character believable. I'm anxious to see more of his work. And I didn't just like the acting, but I liked the character as well. It was interesting to watch him develop and change throughout the movie. Kevin Bacon also did a fantastic job portraying Sebastian Shaw, the villain who, as it happens, was responsible for the Cuban Missile Crisis and the almost start of World War 3. Better add that one to the history books:p -Funny thing, I didn't recognize him as Kevin Bacon until the end of the movie. (That was my blonde moment of the day.)- Folks, honestly, I could go on for a very long time about how good this movie was, but I like to keep things short, so this is all I'll write. I'd love to hear your thoughts, so please comment. Sincerely ~Dragonfly","

I didn't like James McAvoy that much and I feared that this movie could prove a letdown. I was wrong. The movie is great, well directed, CGI good to watch without being more important than the movie itself and - most of all - the acting was really good. McAvoy and Fassbender were great in depicting Xavier and Erik. Their emotions look real, not acted, their chemistry great. And the other characters work well, too, villains and good guys. I liked also the Bondesque style of the part during the 60s. Drama and humour are well mixed and they give depth to a good action movie. Just a last line: Magneto is right in distrusting humans.","

"X-Men: First Class","3xHCCH","9 June 2011","Another Marvel X-Men film, another excellent summer blockbuster! Of all the characters in the Marvel universe, I find the X-Men to be the most interesting of all. This story which explores the beginnings of not just one, but the two most powerful senior X-Men can certainly do no wrong. At first, I was worried about this film being a teenage movie with a lot of teenage angst going on. Wrong. This film is a very mature treatment of the close friendship that developed between the brainy privileged Charles Xavier and the troubled angry Erik Lensherr, and how they forged the beginning of the mutant organization on Earth. We are brought into the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis as the historical backdrop of this story. The main antagonist is the mad and greedy Dr. Sebastian Shaw who also has his own army of mutants. The acting of the cast was also faultless, led by James McAvoy (as Charles) and Michael Fassbender (as Erik). As can be predicted, the turn of Erik to the Dark Side was the more intense character arc, but the Charles angle was not left weak. There was a touching subplot featuring Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast) about mutant appearances, which actors Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult also portrayed very well. Veteran Kevin Bacon does his slimy best as maniacal Dr. Shaw, with the help of the sexy January Jones as the icy Emma Frost.This type of movie, being a prequel, is the type where the beginning and middle are more interesting than the end, which we already know what happens beforehand. I loved how they tied everything up very neatly in the details about each character we all know very well. Director Matthew Vaughn navigates the main story and its subplots into one coherent, entertaining and exciting whole. Bryan Singer, director of the first two (and best two) X-Men movies, is also on board here as one of the writing team. Awesome special effects complete this overall excellent package. A must watch, most certainly!","

"X-Men: First Class","ebiros2","2 October 2011","This fifth installment of the X Men series is by far the best of the bunch. Building on the saga that director Bryan Singer started, this is made on a much bigger budget of $160M compared to that of $70M for the first X Men movie.The story picks up where the first X Men saga started, in the Polish concentration camp run by the Nazis where young Magnito (Bill Milner) started to show his unusual power. A mutant version of Dr. Mengele, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) wants to pick on young Magnito's talent, and in the process murders his mother. Some years later in the early '60s, Eric/Magnito (Michael Fassbender), now a grown young man, wants his revenge on Shaw, and is on his trail. In the mean time, young Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher), finds kindred spirit with also very young Mystique (Morgan Lily). They grow up together in Xavier's home all the way up 'till Xavier graduates from Oxford with a doctorate degree. They team up with mutant genius Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who invents Celebro to locate other mutants. Soon the first batch of X Men is formed (Not the same crew the first X Men were in the comic book series) which includes Magnito, and Banshee who will later become their enemies. By this time, CIA has been introduced to the existence of the mutants, and starts to show their interest. One of the interested party is colonel Stryker. Magnito, still out for his revenge, involves Xavier and other X Men on the battle against Shaw.This is the most polished in terms of production out of all X Men movie series. The screen writers did an excellent job of integrating the origins of X Men saga without hiring back the original actors of the series. Although it's a prequel to the first X Men movie, the movie has freshness that makes it stand alone as an original chapter in the X Men's saga. While other producers continue to trash the Marvel franchise, this series is amazingly consistent in their quality with producer Bryan Singer, and other talented writers, and directors holding the quality together. I loved the plot, and the character development of each of the X Men the way it was shown on this movie. It's an original story, but one that I'm sure will make Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby proud.There were some period piece screw ups in the props like seeing Revox A77 recorder which is a product of the early '70s, and Bose 901 series III speakers which are the product of the early '80s. Fashion, and the buildings were of much more modern vintage than the early '60s when this story is supposed to be taking place. But overall, they didn't mess up the mood of the story too badly.This was a first class production, and even if it wasn't a spectacular hit at the box office, merits a sequel done by the same team of creators.","

"X-Men: First Class","ladyliliroche","30 December 2023","I grew up watching the Xmen animation and the early 2000s movies, but never did considered myself a big XMen fans. I only know and like Storm during that age.This movie still didn't turned me into a big X-Men fan but I am a big fan of this movie. I think the casting of young Charles and Erik were perfect.This is the movie that introduced me to Michael Fassbender and I became his biggest fan. Unfortunately his role after this movies were never as good as Magneto. I do loved him in Fincher's the Killer so thank you for that...And always been the biggest fan of James McAvoy since his Atonement... becoming Jane... and the movie with whats her name and her piggy's nose. Big fan James! But him as Charles was mind blowing. Truly the perfect fit and chemistry with Michael.The story was thrilling. Lots of action scenes that used the mutant powers in an interesting way and they introduced new characters pretty good too. Even the cameos.The music by Henry Jackman is definitely iconic. I did missed hearing his soundtracks in the later movies. The First Class theme is so well done and an earworm. The theme song also warmed up to me as well.Compared to the latter movie, I think this movie set the reboot well. Too bad they didn't use what Matthew Vaughn has created to the fullest. The relationship of charles and erik was wonderful in this movie and I would have like to see it continued more in the later movie (semi excludong doft). Especially since they made the perfect casting for the younger version.","

It is a great way to introduce basically new characters in a new chapter of their lives that we have never seen. It has a good sense of mood, with a fun atmosphere. The overall style to the film is great, with good set pieces and clothing to fit in with the 1960s time period. It is possible to have an X-men film without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine for over a minute. With a good b-plot, good music, fun,smart storytelling, Vaughan's new X-men characters will be beloved!","

"X-Men: First Class","jfgibson73","25 May 2015","I read about all the major Marvel and DC characters in the comics when I was younger. At the time, the X-Men were probably the best written on a consistent basis. But I don't think they were ever as well written as I felt they were in this movie. And I don't think I ever cared about the characters as much as I did watching First Class. The relationships between Charles and the two main villains, Magneto and Mystique, are so poignant. I think I responded to this movie more on an emotional level than any other comic book movie. The Avengers might be more fun, and Winter Soldier might be more expertly crafted, but this one has the most effective melodrama. It's almost a tearjerker, although not in an overly sentimental way. The fact that Charles Xavier taught Magneto to believe in himself, but then they still turned against each other--almost coming to blows, but still caring about each other-- well, that was the major achievement, more so than any special effects.","

"X-Men: First Class","ThatDoesntMatter","5 July 2011","I have never read the comic books.I watched all other 4 films - didn't like them too much, I thought they lacked depth and credibility (and I don't like Famke Janssen, antipathy can ruin films for you...).But hey, I'm open to new beginnings, I love Batman Begins, I'm a sucker for good special effects and a thrill ride in the cinema.I was ready and willing to be entertained, captured, awed.None of that happened.Kevin Bacon (though VERY good in this) spoke such bad German that it was hard to listen and not laugh (which many did...:-)). So that was a slight put-off right at the beginning.And it DID slightly remind me of Batman Begins with the boys the age they are...Sadly, this film is not about telling a good story, making you like/love the characters, and making it exciting with fast-paced and mind- blowing special effects (never mind a good story...).As one reviewer wrote, I too sat wishing I could watch a Transformers film instead.This film is superficial, wildly edited into short fragments and longer boring passages, has no good special effects, has annoying music, cringe-worthy dialogues, stupid characters with no depth or any development, and the Nazi theme as well as the Bay of Pigs theme was pitiful.Professor X was screaming NO!!, I was inwardly screaming: Why the hell not?! Just kill the Nazi. For heaven's sake, pacifism only goes so far...lol Later as well - throw the bombs back on them, why the hell not??!! Following orders could have been a good theme taken up, but no, it's an American popcorn film - blown up, filled mostly with air, and totally tasteless unless you add fat, sugar, or salt. Which they failed to do.James McAvoy was wrong for this, Michael Fassbender spoke bad German as well (dialogue coach gone awol?) but passable French, Kevin Bacon was my favourite in this as mentioned, and it was a pleasure to see him die - I mean that in a good way.Bad film.","

"X-Men: First Class","cracker","11 June 2011","Spend enough money on marketing, ""virola"" and shill reviews, and you too can turn a dog into a blockbuster. ""X Men: First Class"" is the latest example of the precipitous decrease in the quality and intelligence of Hollywood product.Why is it so HUGE then? Well, when you consider several thousand people are involved with any big budget movie today, all of whom have friends, family, and some degree of vested interest in the success of the film, and how easy it is to flood the sites like IMDb with outright LIES... it's simple to figure how we keep getting fooled by an army of liars. Oh there's also the fact that they obviously bought the critics and are spending money they should have spent on ACTORS on a deluge of TV spots.Some specifics, if you need the overlay to say ""Moscow... Russia"" when the scene changes to a ""Red Square"" environment and might have otherwise puzzled, ""Hey wait, is that Moscow, Russia? or Moscow, Texas?"" stop reading and go see it, you will love this movie. It was made for your demographic.If on the other hand you expect decent acting and direction in your comic book movies, together with some comic relief, an intelligent script, and effects that allow you to suspend disbelief instead of looking at your watch during the big CGI scenes, this movie has -none- of those things, not one iota.Kevin Bacon? great actor, awful comic book movie villain. Rest of the cast are no-names, and it shows, painfully. The script is trite white hat/black hat fare, dredging up the Nazis in case you ""Moscow, Russia"" folks can't figure out who the bad guy is. Maybe three comic relief moments in the film, no one in the packed theater with me laughed... ever. In fact, I suspect everyone else in the theater was busy looking at their watches with me.Painful and very dishonestly hyped here and elsewhere.","

"X-Men: First Class","FlashCallahan","26 June 2011","Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time.Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war.....Strangely enough, one of the most under-hyped summer movies this year, turns out to be one of the best Marvel Adaptions made. Thor and Captain America have the biggest pull this year, Because of the avengers, bu this is a classy film, proving that Vaughn is one cool director, and a great storyteller.He has got one of he best casts of the year, and managed to get a great performance from everyone of them. McAvoy and Fassbender are simply wonderful as X and Magneto, and kudos to them for not copying their older counterparts ala Ewan Macgregor in the Star Wars prequels.But the best thing about this is Kevin Bacon, and his sinister verging on the edge of brilliance/highly camp Shaw. He steals every scene he is, and exudes evil as much as he consumes energy.But as always, with films with a lot of characters, a lot get lost in the fray. Jones is lost, and just spends the time looking pretty, The guy who can make wind doesn't even spout a line, and Flemying should have been used more.The set pieces here are spectacular, and surprisingly very tense. The attack with Erik and the anchor is exciting with great editing and use of effects, and the attack by Azazel dropping the 'men in black' from the sky has to be one of the set pieces of the year up to now.It's not just an event movie, this has to be the best X-men film made up to now, and thats down to Vaughn and Goldman thinking beyond the effects and giving us a great story, references to the fates of the X-men, characters to care for, and a narrative that is easy to follow.And plus we have one of the best cameos of the year.So all in all, it's not just a great summer movie, it's probably one of the best films released this year.","

"X-Men: First Class","Enchorde","3 November 2011","X-men: First Class is a very good and entertaining action movie, much better than other spin-offs from the X-men saga. In my mind, it might be the best since the original X-men, even though I missed a few of the characters from the sequels.But being a prequel, which is always tricky, First Class does it very well. I'm actually impressed how the story was written as to be both fun and not overly evident, but at the same time keeping the integrity of the ""following"" movie.Of course there are lots and lots of special effects, most of which are done very well. It fits the story, and never feels out of place. Maybe not too hard to accomplish since a story like this needs a lot of special effects.I liked many of the ""new"" characters as well. Not being familiar to the comic X-men world I can't say if they're true to the comic, but they felt right in the movie. Not sure if they can return in an eventual sequel since they do not appear in the ""original"". They have also found a good cast to the characters, McAvoy does it good as a young Xavier, but can't unfortunately not really compare to Patrick Stewart. Then Fassbender is better as Magneto. Lucas Till and January Jones fits their characters nicely, but perhaps best is Kevin Bacon as the villain Shaw. Bacon is underrated and it is nice to see him in a leading role.In all this is an entertaining movie, mostly because of good action. It is not as good in the humor and one-liners as the original, mostly delivered there by Wolverine, whom does have a cameo though. It is a very good prequel though, and I would be interested to see if and when they continue the saga.7/10","

"X-Men: First Class","n_burli","18 September 2011","I cannot believe the fact that I literally had to go looking for a bad review to convince myself I'm not the only one. The film was the most disappointing series ever made, and this is saying a lot since Wolverine used to be the worst series in my book. Mathew Vaughn clearly does not know how to make a super-hero film.The story looked like it was written by a 10 year old. The only convincing characters were Xavier & Magneto, the rest were just there to fill screen space. Before I watched the film I saw the trailer and I thought ""This is gonna be the best film ever"". The fact that they had the balls to merge a fictional story with an event that actually took place in history was a bold move. However, the presentation was just pathetic. This film will probably be epic through the eyes of a 14 year old but any age-group beyond that should have walked out of the theater laughing his/ her ass off. There comes a time when one must be able to differentiate between cliché & originality. ""Mutant & Proud"", are you kidding me? WE KNOW they're mutants, we know they have super-human powers, saying mutant over and over and over again does not make the message any clearer. ""You want the Mutants? Take them, just let us normal people go"" The dialogs could not be worse.Why would anyone make fun of super-hero abilities? Especially the ones depicted in the film. I can understand Beast, his feet are quite ugly. The scene where the two security guards come about and start making fun of the kids was nothing but hilarious. Xavier and Eric are supposed to have had a rich history, not something that just ends within a span of two hours. Apart from the fact that Xavier gets paralyzed in the dumbest manner possible, did they HAVE to do it so soon? Is this the history of how Charles Xavier looses his legs, is this the history of the friendship between him and Magneto? Is it really? This is it? Nothing more? No epic battle sequence between the two symbolizing the end of their bond? When I thought of the break of friendship between the two I was thinking Naruto & Saske (Apologies to those of you who don't understand you may Google it out and get the facts in an instant). Kevin Bacon as whoever the hell he's supposed to be has done the most ridiculous acting I have ever seen. The Diamond chick was a blond in the most Literal sense of the word, and what was up with Xavier's students? He uses Cerebro to find an army and those guys are the only ones he could find? Are you serious? If I have the power to contact other Mutants I'll make a whole damn' army with it, not recruit some no good kids who have no idea how to fight (or act).The scene with Magneto killing the three guys in the bar could have been so much more. A stab to the head rather than the stomach, a slit to the throat (depicted by a blood splatter to the wall) than a pussy stab to the hand, to which the reaction was like he was on opium. If the gun in my hand is being controlled not by my own will, my first reaction would be to let it go!So fine, Magneto had to turn against everyone. Mystique had to come to his side, but mere dialogs aren't enough to satisfy an audience. There was nothing emotional about it, nor was it tragic, and honestly, I saw it coming five minutes after the film started.The Visual Effects looked like it was from the 70's. I swear to god Star Wars (1977) looks more realistic than this.This film could have been the greatest origin story ever. There is no reason to ever believe that this is even close to a good film, especially for the fans. I really shouldn't say this because I'm agnostic, but God help the future of this series.","

The movie was not that bad, actually. But several and several movies from one single comic is something that deserves concerns.Well.. When I found out that a new X-Men movie was about to debut, I got excited, but at the same time, concerned about saturating EVEN MORE the comic. OK, the trailer looked AWESOME, fantastic actors and amazing special effects. ""WOOOW!"", I thought. But after seeing this movie, the first word that came to my mind was ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!""... man, it worth SO much! Without a doubt, the most terrific from all previous. In addition to an excellent script and memorable dialogues, Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy, was absolutely captivating..Excellent choice from director Matthew Vaughn. I gotta say that ALL the support cast was great too. (WHAT WAS THAT LINE PLAYED BY WOLVERINE??? LOL!!!)But for Magneto, my fav. character, played by the fantastic Sir Ian McKellen in the previous ones and now played by Michael Fassbender, I must write a separated paragraph. Fassbender, what a stunning actor! He completely stole the scene. His feelings for revenge and friendship, all mixed up with his fears and traumas, developed a remarkable performance to the audience. Magneto is that unique type of villain that people LOVE to hate. And Fassbender seemed to know exactly what that means :) It was kind of sad to see his friendship with Charles Xavier ruined by his hate and desire for revenge. But the final scene of them, man.. was epic!For me, personally, was a delightful surprise. I recommended to all my friends to go see this movie. But Marvel, PLEASE, 5 movies is quite enough, OK? The fifth movie was the highest achievement, don't need to make any other after that, seriously :)","

"X-Men: First Class","Carycomic","4 June 2011","Which is the only reason I don't give this a perfect ten. MacAvoy and Fassbender are superb as early day versions of Charles Xavier and Erik Magnus Lensherr. And, even the transposition of Darwin and Tempest from their early 21st century comic book appearances, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, I can deal with.But, what I cannot abide is needless rebooting with no regard for the memory of the older movie-goers, or credit for their intelligence.Emma Frost was ten years younger in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (which was set mostly in the 1970's) than January Jones' portrayal, here. Of course, fan boys like me can easily ret-con that by saying: ""Oh! Maybe the one in ORIGINS is this one's namesake niece. Maybe even her daughter! After all, Silver Fox did call her 'my sister.' Which could imply some kind of adoptive sibling relationship.""But, not so easy to ignore is the fact that this prequel depicts Xavier being accidentally crippled by Moira McTaggart. Whereas, in the flashback prologue of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (set circa the 1980's), he was seen as perfectly ambulatory. _Walking_ into the Grey family's residence, to meet adolescent Jean, side-by-side with Lensherr! How are you going to explain that one away, Fox and Marvel? A bitter, time-traveling Romulan from the 24th Century? I don't think so.In short; the movie wasn't bad. But, in this case? ""Not bad"" is just not good enough.","

"X-Men: First Class","blackmambamark","3 June 2011","The series that started out as MARVELS prize stallion in the film industry, has since been raped in the ass by films such as ""Wolverine"" and ""X-Men: Last Stand"". How can you possibly go forward with a series that has been tarnished twice? Well, you do what they did with Batman.....you start from the beginning. Yes, i know that this is truly NOT a reboot, but the studios are hoping that this leap back to the past will create a jump start on a series that was thought to be all but lost.....let's hope they're right for a change.I can easily say this without feeling any regret.......this is without a doubt the best X-Men movie created. Yes, i know that most of you ""X2"" fans will be throwing your hands up in the air. But let me explain why.....First off, the character development in this movie is amazing. Director Mathew Vaughn does an incredible job of making every single good character likable, and every bad character hateable. Watching a young Professor Xavier get drunk and hit on women. Watching a young Magneto cover the globe killing Nazis......uh, i'll watch that any day of the week. And since we're on the topic of Xavier and Magneto.....my god, if you thought the original combination of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart was amazing......wait until you see the combo of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. No, i'm not saying that this duo is better, but i'm not saying it's worse either. Never in my wildest dreams did i think anyone could compete, but these two are really something special to watch on screen. Even before they cross paths. Their characters alone could make an entire picture. Especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto. In my opinion, he's the one who stole the show.As far as story lines....it's a bit of the same old stuff, just in a different time period. But this go around seems much fresher. It offers a much more different take and a broader spectrum than the typical 'These are humans, and these are Mutans...now fight'. It delves more into the history aspect, which to any guy, is always cool.However, the only slight problem i had with the film was towards the end, right before the final battle. You have all these characters who just came together, and you're really ready to watch them finally go crazy after watching this amazing montage of Xavier helping them. And right after this happens, they drop some plot points out of nowhere. I get WHY they had to do it, but the placement felt just a bit off to me. I think if they spread them around the movie instead of having it come out of nowhere towards the end, then maybe it would have been okay. But does it take anything away from the film? Absolutely not.Bottom Line.....i said it once, and i'll say it again. This is the best X-Men movie i have seen thus far. Everything from the acting to the storyline......it was amazing. And even thought i think a lot of people will give all the credit to the acting, which in a way they're right.....i however, give it all to Director Matthew Vaughn. He took a story which easily could have been crapped on by producers and studio exec's, and he made it his own, and he made it fresh and fun. Even if you disagree with me and say ""X2"" is still better...you still won't be able to deny the fact that this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch. Without a doubt the best movie i have seen so far this year. Captain America and Green Lantern.....the bar has been set.","

"X-Men: First Class","thekyles99","9 July 2011","Another fantastic 2011 summer release! The thing i like with this and the Transformers franchise is they only keep getting better and better! This instalment being a prequel tells a lot of the origins of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Xavier (James McAvoy) and how the good and bad alliances were formed. Another great one for fans of Cgi (As i am ) The story turns back the clocks to 1960's during the time of the missile crisis between the US and Russia! As World War 3 seems eminent, both Magneto and Professor X work together as a villain Sebastian Shaw (played brilliantly by Kevin Bacon) plans on using his powers to use WW3 to eliminate the human race altogether making earth a planet for mutants only. A great prequel which in my mind could be used also as a vessel for more prequels if Matthew Vaughn hopefully wants to. To me this is the best comic book super hero franchise presently going and i hope to keep seeing more!","

"X-Men: First Class","tr91","28 July 2013","Being a fan of the original X-Men films, I was really looking forward to this. I thought it would be interesting to find out a little bit more about the earlier lives of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr.I really liked how the story developed and the roles of Charles and Erik were portrayed fantastically by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively. The other (previously unseen) mutants in this movie were also interesting, especially Hank. The cameo from Wolverine was also hilarious.The storyline was great and plenty of action to keep you gripped. Overall this film was brilliant and I am really looking forward to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' now, especially after this one was left on such a cliffhanger. I think this is definitely as good as the original trilogy of X-Men films, possibly better. This is one that you just have to see.10/10 -","

"X-Men: First Class","dragos-x55","6 August 2011","It's a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie. All positive reviews here are fake! The story was very boring. The SR-71 Blackbird aircraft should only have one or, rarely, two seats, and it is not hollow inside. The submarine had a way too large interior for its size, not to mention its interior was completely unrealistic. The scene with the missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews. One might begin to wonder whether somebody is manipulating the system. And how could this movie possibly have an 8.0 rating? I no longer trust IMDb and its ratings. IMDb has become corrupt, unfortunately. I demand that IMDb does something to fix this.","

"X-Men: First Class","SnoopyStyle","17 August 2013","Fox decided to reboot the X-Men franchise with new actors as younger versions of the familiar roles. This prequel takes place mostly in 1962 before and around the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's a good start especially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good young actors to refresh the franchise. James McAvoy is the new Charles Xavier. Jennifer Lawrence is Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is Beast. Michael Fassbender is Magneto. With them as well as others, the franchise looks to be on solid grounds. As for this movie itself, it's a little bit slow at times. I think we're suppose to go weak in the knees every time a new actor for each iconic role is revealed. It's still great to see the new actors in action. They'll probably grow into their roles in the next movie. This is a solid starting point.","

"X-Men: First Class","kosmasp","9 January 2012","After Matthew Vaughn refused a prior X-Men movie, he finally came and made this one. And it seems like he made the right decision. He had more to say in this, then he would have had in the earlier one. Still even as it is, there are of course a few things to be considered (timeline-wise) and even I could see and smile about a few nods to things/nods to future happenings.It has be said, that this is a stand-alone and has not that much to do with the other X-Men movies. But since I am not that aware of the comics I can only compare it to the other movies. And this is definitely a very good entry into the series (and ties can still be found, with one particular cameo that was just really funny).Apart from the coherent story and nice build up (even if you can see where it is going and you probably will), the other thing that makes this movie special, are the actors. Top notch casting with some heavyweight actors put into the mix. Highly recommended, even if you're not that much into comic movies ...","

"X-Men: First Class","krycek19","2 September 2011","Very very very long and very very very boring prequel to the previous X-men film.And what's with the title: First Class?? Is that because the people behind this crap think this movie is better than the first three abominations of X-men movies? The only good things in this movie are Michael Fassbender and all of the gorgeous voluptuous female mutants.The best scene is the one minute scene where Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) tells Xavier and Magneto to go f*ck themselves before they get a chance to even tell him who they are.And that scene just made me miss the Wolverine movie that has five things this movie completely lacks: a good story, lots of action, it was funny, had interesting characters and good acting.I imagine Hugh refused to be a part of this garbage since he is making his own movies now only about Wolverine. I only hope that a sequel to Wolverine will come soon so I can forget this load of bull-crap.","

"X-Men: First Class","agmoldham","30 September 2011","I didn't enter the movie with high expectations, but must confess to enjoying the latest prequel more than many of it's counterparts.The film starts with one of the scenes from the original movie and then flashes backwards and forwards with the majority of the film based in 1962.Here we find Xavier and Magneto becoming aware of their powers and finding others with special powers. The film is very well scripted and in common with the better films in the X series you really feel empathy or at least understanding with most of the leading characters. As with other prequels you always have a very good idea about what the ultimate conclusion will be but it's a great ride getting there and thoroughly enjoyable.","

"X-Men: First Class","wen77","26 May 2012","If you are going for mindless big action fun, you'll probably be mildly amused and then forget all about it. The special effects are standard not mind blowing, but sufficient. I find personally it is the subtle touches, the emotion evoked rather than big flashy gestures that impress and those were lacking. The jokes are cheesy but in places fun.The fundamental reason this fails is the very same reason that the Return of the Sith failed. Neither of these films respect the inherent conflicts of the main characters and fail miserably to use them to their full potential. For me this film was exciting for one reason and one reason only, the Charles/Erik back story. To see enemies as friends, drawn together by a secret that alienates them from the world, to see prejudice and fear pull them apart until they stand on opposite sides of a chasm they don't know how to bridge. This was the heart that was missing from this movie. They are portrayed as blandly civil allies, temporarily bonded but always clear on their path- which might have worked if that path had been diverted at any point- it wasn't and we know it isn't in the future, the limitation of the prequel. Further potential is squandered in the sister/brother relationship between Mystique and Charles. It could have been a great opportunity to develop Charles and knock him from his perfect perch, as he has the position, easily abused, of benevolent benefactor, as well as friend. Instead he is once again blandly civil in every aspect. Mystique as the premier female baddie of the franchise, is reinvented as mild, sweet and apparently in love with every lead male, which (minus the last point) had potential, yet again it is handled with a shovel.The emotional wasteland is made all the worse by the painfully linear storyline. What happened to Erik after he was separated from his family?Answered in the first five minutes. How has this shaped him as a man? The next five minutes. Which also make sure you know who the bad guy is, just how bad he is and leave no confusion about his villainous interests and why he is working with mutants. Also shoehorned in are various other convenient set-ups which make sure we get instantly bang up to date. So that the next film, which while I'm sure it will have some funky 70's disco tunes, will be pretty much exactly the same in all the respects that matter as every other film in the franchise, just without the wit, depth or resonance that Singer brought to the first two.","

"X-Men: First Class","theanchors793","16 June 2011","I love superhero movies. However, very rarely do I say that they are good movies.That being said, this was a great movie.There are many great things going for this movie. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely brilliant. I was stunned at the level of acting I saw from these two considering this very rare in superhero movies. I border on saying Fassbender's performance is Oscar-worthy.I haven't seen a performance this good since Colin Firth in the King's Speech. McAvoy also gave a very impressive performance. As with most comic book movies today there were liberties taken from the comic book but I excused it as it was pulled off fairly well. The plot was much more driven and on course as opposed to the previous installment which was all over the place.Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique was much better than the previous actress and she added life to the character. There really wasn't a bad acting performance seen as in the other movies.The visual effects were incredible. Seeing Magneto pull the submarine out of the water was breathtaking and didn't look fake like many other movies. I would say go see even if you're not a X-men fan as I was quite impressed.","

"X-Men: First Class","harry_tk_yung","5 June 2011","Despite the common verdict that puns represent the lowest form of humour, they are ever popular. So, has this clever movie title earned its place? The exalting praise of ""first class"" is usually over-used. Still, ""X-men: First Cast"" can arguably be considered the best in the franchise to-date, as generally agreed by movie critics and audience.As an action flick, this movie is exceptionally rich in themes and sub-texts. Consistently in the background and coming forth to the forefront at suitable junctures is the franchise's main theme: the place of mutants in the world of ""normal"" human beings, a variation of the familiar minority issue. Very cleverly superimposed onto this movie is a chapter in modern history that the world well remembers: the Cuban Missile Crisis, but with a twist – as ex-Nazi Sebastian Shaw's conspiracy. And then, there is a brief but distinct sub-text on recklessness when one is young (""youth will have its fling"", W. S. Gilbert's favourite lyrics), as exemplified in the young mutant recruits' party-making when they were left to themselves in the CIA research centre where they are accommodated.Those are at the macro level. On the intimate personal stories, there is ample evidence of close attention paid in development of characters and relationships, absolutely devoid of often-seen sloppy laziness in many lesser movies in this genre. Most prominent is the friendship and eventual falling out between Charles Xavier (young Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (young Magneto). Another key character Raven (young Mystique) is also thoughtfully conceived and positioned, in a sort-of triangle, ""sort-of"" because although Xavier had discovered her since they were young children, what he had for her is sibling love. Mystique's gradual shifting and eventual allegiance with Magneto is convincingly plotted with strategically places scene throughout the movie.Equally sensibly, contrary to the meticulous care given to the key characters, some minor characters are treated almost if they were mere props, notably Sebastian Shaw's pair of bodyguards (as if he needs any) who are little more than weapons in human form – Riptide and Azazel. This is necessary because there is such a proliferation of characters in between, requiring varying degrees of depth in handling. These will be addressed later in conjunction with the various actors playing these parts.As a prequel, ""First Class"" is among the best in carefully establishing ""what happened before"", such as Magneto's helmet, Xavier's wheelchair (""I'm not going to move. I can't even feel my legs""), Xavier's school for mutants etc. The most important question is of course what made Magneto what he is today. While the preludes of Star Wars take three movies to chart Anakin Skywalker's transformation to Darth Vader, Magneto's dark side is fully explained in ""First Class"" (reportedly the first of the X-men prequel trilogy). Except for the three key characters mentioned, no others from the franchise appear except for 20-second cameo of Logan. And what an uproar of mirth Hugh Jackman's one-liner extracted from the audience! Casting this movie must have been a huge job, and it was a job well done. James McAvoy is a believable young Xavier (not because he says ""Maybe I'll go bald some day"") with just the right amounts of doses of compassion, brilliance and authority. Michael Fassbender is probably better remembered in his military role in ""Inglourious Basterds"" than as Connors the gentle but immoral seducer in ""Fish Tank"", two performances that testified to his diversity. To Magneto, he brings an explosive intensity and a subtly perceptible humanity. Latest Oscar nominee from ""Winter's bone"" Jennifer Lawrence makes a good job of Mystique as a teenage girl, blue-skinned or otherwise. Kevin Bacon is iconic chief villain Sebastian Shaw is a natural.Of the assortment of other mutants on both sides, two have been given heavier roles. The name Nicholas Hoult may not ring a bell but those who have seen ""About a boy"" (2002) should remember the boy. A few years later, in ""The weather man"" (2005) he played Nicholas Cage's titular character's gentle, introvert son. He now plays the equally timid young scientist Hank MaCoy, timid until his full Frankenstein complex is released, turning him into Beast. January Jones is a name that will be remember on its own, but the actress also showed her worth in the recent movie ""Unknown"" (2011) as a wife who suddenly and mysterious denies all knowledge or recognition of her husband (a role played by Liam Neeson). Here, she is Emma Frost, who is to Sebastian Shaw what Mystique is to Magneto.Two ""minority"" characters (to be interpreted here as one without mutant power) deserve mention. Rose Byrne has appeared in a good number of movies with a variety of roles. The one I remember most is ""Adam"" (2009) in which her character has a bitter-sweet romance with an endearing autistic young man played by Hugh Dancy. In ""First Class"" she plays endearing CIA agent Moira who discovered Xavier and the rest of them. Oliver Platt, who needs no introduction, plays a character with no name, a CIA researcher identified as ""Man in black suit"", and obvious tribute to ""Man in black"" (1997).The special effects in ""First Class"" are excellent. The sets are slick, in a very pleasing sort of way.","

"X-Men: First Class","LeonLouisRicci","1 June 2015","Origin Stories are Really-Cool. It is the Foundation of All Mythology. This One Takes Some Liberties with the Characters Involved in the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Comic from 1962, but the X-Men Have Had So Many Members Over the Years that Modern Audiences Might Not Care that Much. Perhaps One of the Reasons that the X-Men Comics and the Movie Franchise is So Popular is Because of the Number and Diversity of Characters and an Ever Changing Roster of Interesting Mutants. So the Altering of the Team's Origin Story isn't as Heavy as Say a Bat-Man, Superman, or Spider-Man Origin. With the Single Super-Hero Concept the One Beginning Cannot Really be Changed That Much Without Causing Blowback of Behemoth Proportions.This is Another Exciting, Extraordinary, Execution from the Marvel Universe. Setting the Film in 1962 and Wrapping it Around the Cuban Missile Crisis was Inspirational and the ""Brink of Nuclear War"" Plot Adds a Certain Depth to the Thing. Kudos to Director Matthew Vaughn Along with Some Great Casting and Flashy and Superb SFX from John Dykstra.It Brings Along Social Commentary that is Delivered Amongst the Overwhelming Visuals Making it Easy to Absorb. This One is a Clever and Welcome Entertainment, Not Only in the Super-Hero Genre, but in the World of Big-Budget, Summer Blockbuster, Eye-Candy Fun.

"X-Men: First Class","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","2 June 2011","During the Cold War, Magneto joins Xavier in an effort to stop Sebastian Shaw. This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn't need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn't establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It's unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It's brutal at times, with Lensherr's quest for revenge. This isn't really ""action"" as much as ""thriller"", and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I've seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10","

"X-Men: First Class","nagyistvanandor","12 June 2011","Ever since I stepped out of the cinema, something so did not felt right about the movie. I watched it in English too, and all though its cleared one of the things that did not made sense to me (In Hungarian there's a translation mistake, which makes it sound the William Stryker in First Class is the same how we meet in X-men origins: Wolverine and X-2, and not the Father of him.) But that was only a slight difference, and the others still remained there. I checked the Faq section of First Class and finally I got some answers, but totally not the type of answers I would have liked.""Is ""First Class"" a prequel or reboot? It's both actually. First Class goes back to 1962, to a time before Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, making it a prequel in the X-Men franchise. However, there are changes in continuity because, as director Matthew Vaughn explains it, we ""were trying to reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise and therefore, making a film work on its own two feet was far more important than trying to be referential to the prior movies."" . In short, First Class is an attempt to take the characters back to an earlier period (a prequel) from which future movies can be rebooted.""So thats a replay to many of the things which did not feel right about X-men First Class. Personally to represent how I feel about this ""brilliant"" idea I would send Wolverines words to the Director and Story writers of First class. The ones he says when Charles and Eric approach him at the pub... This fact alone blows down, 5 stars from the movie. Why the hack was there any need to reboot a great and developed tale? Dose Matthew Vaughn has a brain size of a peanut? and cant remember / keep in mind 4 movies? Not to do things which conflicts with the other movies? Or simply he just has zero Creativity and could not make up something, Like Hank Mccoy/Beast developed a machine which makes him able to look like a human for a period of time. //In X-2 we see him as a human. // Its don't even need to be genetic solution, a hologram or something could do that as well. Or for another example which got people confused in Wolverine movie... hint that the government toked blood sample from Emma Frost, which later on Stryker could use for his experiment, and the girl how we see in the end of the Wolverine movie, and claimed to be Silverfox sister aren't really Emma Frost, just a girl how Stryker experimented with.So generally I would say First Class has a huge lack of story development. And the answer ""oh its a reboot so it doesn't need to match with the other movies"" don't make it a bit better, just even worst. Over all the story wasn't so bad, quite watchable, if You can ignore the things I listed above. Acting was good, I cant complain to any of the actors. Visual effects was nicely made. But the concepts, and development of the movie is quite lame. I don't feel its a well though trough tale, no surprises like ""Oh i did not see that coming"". Its kinda showed what it should have shown, without creativity and lots of laziness... and ""oh its a reboot"" aren't an excuse. Thats whats makes X-men First Class The worst X-men movie ever, and makes it barely reach the line Watchable.So like I say in the beginning of my review... Director and writers of X-men First class: Go F Your self's...","

"X-Men: First Class","ryanskywalker-87402","1 March 2017","Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in the X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X- Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Erik Lehnsherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography, state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational score.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is pretty convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two is what makes this film work so wonderfully along with the fine input coming from the rest of its supporting cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a marvelous score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one.","

"X-Men: First Class","Boba_Fett1138","29 May 2012","This movie works out as good entertainment but was it truly necessary and does it also adds something to the movie X-men franchise? Not enough, in my opinion.Really, I was not opposed to the idea of a prequel/reboot for the movie series but I feel that the execution of it is lacking just a bit too much and the movie is filled with some missed opportunities and poor executions of potentially good and interesting ideas.Don't worry, I liked this movie more than I didn't but the movie is receiving so much praise, while it in fact is still really such a lacking movie, that I feel that I should counterbalance it.The main problem I had with this movie, concerned both the Magneto and professor X character and their relation. I never got the feeling that they were true friends, which could had given this movie and all of the other X-Men movies so much more emotional impact. Besides, I never felt that Magneto was ever a good guy. He pretty much is a rogue and dangerous person from the start on already, who never had any good or noble intentions. So it also really seems unlikely that they ever were friends in the first place, since they are driven by completely different motivations and have different goals. Their friendship should had been the key and center of this movie and something that should had been build on in future X-Men movies but the movie has far too many other distractions in it, for it to ever work out.It to me also never felt like these two were the same characters, who also got portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the other X-Men movies. They look nothing alike and even sound completely different. This thought constantly distracted me and prevented me from ever truly liking James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in their roles, even while in fact they are far from bad actors of course.But yes, it's simply still an enjoyable movie for what it is. It features a decent enough script, decent characters, decent action and decent entertainment in it. nothing ever truly stands out in my opinion and the movie does has its slower and weaker moments still but overall this is one fine movie to watch, if you simply want to be entertained for a couple of hours. If you are expecting this movie to add more insightful depth or emotional impact to its characters or just the series as a whole, you are wrong. In that regard this movie really doesn't add enough to the series, though it still remains a welcome addition.It's also a movie that does still surprise, in some ways. One thing it really surprises with is its villain. Kevin Bacon sounds like such an unlikely choice to play a villain in a superhero movie but he often was one of the highlights of the movie and simply did a good job with his role and he seemed to be having some fun with all of it as well.Also the inclusion of the some new characters and the first introduction of some character that were already familiar to the series, all are welcome additions. Most of the characters get plenty of screen time and enough action to do, so it never really feels as if some of them simply got put into the movie to fill up the screen with or to help to make the movie long enough. They all serve a purpose and with their mutant powers they also help to make an impact with their roles, on the story.A bit of a pointless prequel that doesn't really add enough to the franchise in my opinion but it simply remains a fun and entertaining film, with plenty of action to enjoy as well. As a superhero flick, this movie does simply not disappoint, despite all of my criticism.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

Extremely cheesy dialogue, a couple okay action scenes but nothing outstanding. The whole thing feels like less of a movie than the others. Despite some well known names, the cast feels weak and like they're not really into their roles.This movie is good for some unintentional comedy, however. There are some silly scenes. It all feels much cheaper and more amateurish. The movie expects you to be as into it as it is into itself.

"X-Men: First Class","malcoms-flicks","6 June 2011","I almost want to say 'hands down, best X-Men movie thus far' but I just cant decide. First class did have it all. The writing was pretty clever, the way they wrote the main story around the Cuban missile crisis. The actors portrayed every character flawlessly. There were beautiful women; beautiful men for that matter, and plenty of action and momentum to keep you pumped throughout the film. Even a cameo that made a few hairs stand up, from sheer BAD- ASS. We are inducting this movie into the franchise; and with honor I'd say. Its not a reboot or a sequel or even a prequel. Just another story line in the creative world of X-MEN. We started with the first 3 films followed by the epic spin off 'Origins: Wolverine' and now we get to witness how it all started with 'First Class'. These first four films success are greatly thanks to Wolverine. Played by, in every film, Hugh Jackman. Geniusly I am definitely gonna add. I think we can all agree, for sure, that Jackman cannot be out played for the role of everyones favorite X man. Not just the almost freakish way he physically looks like the character but the way he becomes Wolverine is what really takes you away. This is where the conflict comes in as far as where to rank the new installment, critically. Taking the franchise in a new direction, first class introduces characters not as popular as Wolverine. An X-Men movie without him!? This may be a disappointment to movie goers. Despite these new characters, you most definitely will not be disappointed.First off, I have to say excellent job to Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Right away, his performance makes the absence of wolverine extraneous and makes way for a character even more powerful and just as conflicted. Fassbender Plays magneto brilliantly as well. Before this film, Magneto was arguably, the top super villain created. Post film, I will say with confidence ""thee number one"" super villain. As its told in this film, Erik Lehnsherr is a Jewish German whose family is taken to concentration camps in 1944 Nazi Germany. But is emancipated by Sebastian Shaw played; wonderfully evil by Kevin Bacon, to be an apprentice slash lab rat. As Lehnsherr grows up, he is fueled by hate for what had happened to him and his family and sets out for revenge. He advances his powers with rage and anger, becoming an extremely powerful and deadly weapon. Within his campaign he meets a man named Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy. Who for the first time in his life, gives Lehnsherr some sort of vision and feelings besides his tunneled focus for revenge charged by hate.McAvoy brings into being, a Professor X with a bit more spice then I would have expected, compared to his older self played perfectly by Patrick Stewart in the first three installments. Despite his early mild frat boy style we still see Xavier compose the authentic trait of compassion we all know to be Charles Xavier. It was a nice surprise to see a young, newly deemed professor, with other things on his mind, like girls and having fun rather then his life devoted focus for helping mutants and man kind alike. As we see the professor start to develop that life long devotion, James gives us a benevolent, yet thrilling ride into those big shoes Xavier will have to fill to become Professor X.With a mutual compassion for the discovery of new mutants, Together Erik and Xavior become a team, finding and offering mutants a chance for something great. We get to see mutants like Havok, and Beast played by Lucas Till and Nicholas Hoult and other familiars like the young Mystique played by Jennifer Lawrence. These young group of kids struggle to harness and control their great gifts, with the first of many lessons taught by Professor X. With common enemies, the team helps agent Moira MacTaggert, played by Rose Byrne, and the CIA find the extremely dangerous Sebastian Shaw. A mutant powerful enough to turn humans against each other using nuclear war, with the intention of the extinction of homo sapien and the rise of mutants. This is an epic adaptation and one of many possible story lines in the X-Men universe. Its a story of coming of age and fulfilling your responsibility for who you are meant to be. A tale of a two sided coin where on one side a man raised by hate and fear believes our species to be an ignorant race and will only fear what they do not understand. Which will lead to a violent vindication towards mutants, and a war to the death. While on the other side, another man believes that even though this may be true, there is good in everyone and this war will be fought to educate the world to result in peace and unity. No matter the side, war is inevitable and both sides will fight for their beliefs, at all costs. As a Marvel fan boy, keep um coming! There are so many characters and so many ways Marvel studios can take them. Maybe there are some things that didn't exactly happen in the very first comic book. Or maybe the time line is a bit off here or there. So what, these stories are wonderful cinematic adventures! We can rate these movies all day, and each film will see every spot on the rank line, but no doubt, each one are incredibly entertaining and totally fun to watch. If you're like me and these Marvel films bring you back to when you were Wolverine fighting Magneto on the playground at lunch, or if you have never even heard of the X-men you will enjoy them all. As far as rank goes 'Hands down best X-Men movie thus far' Why don't you guys see it, and let me know.","

"X-Men: First Class","fleetstar","9 October 2011","Well, where to begin. Unfortunately I read the X-Men comics in the 1960's, and this doesn't reflect the style of those stories.Why is that Hollywood film makers, think that they can change everything into what they want it to be. What was so bad about the original comic stories that they have to be re-written into something that changes the essence of the whole experience.Where were the original X-Men, Cyclops, Iceman, Angel etc and do we really need the relationships changing this radically. This type of alteration is unforgivable. Go and see Kenneth Branagh, and get him to make the thing properly.I haven't really any complaints about the acting, as everyone did a good job. As a film for anyone unfamiliar with the early X-men comics I suppose it could pass for a reasonable superhero film. It's just really sad that this chance to make an excellent origin film has now probably gone for good. I won't be rushing to watch the next one. Poor job, must try harder !","

"X-Men: First Class","Pjtaylor-96-138044","25 April 2018","'X-men First Class (2011)' stripped the series back a little, arguably closer to its roots, to focus on character development rather than overt spectacle and is all the better for it. Its new cast is great as the young characters, especially McAvoy and Fassbender who - along with a nuanced and layered script - convincingly portray the origins of their respectful yet tumultuous relationship. It doesn't quite capture the spirit of the original, but has a lot more life in its presentation and provided a successful revitalisation to a franchise that was running out of steam. Like its predecessors, it is at its best when pondering the thematic quandaries at the heart of its core concepts but it also has a few stand-out set-pieces and some nice dark, yet understated, brutality (the concentration camp makes a return). It isn't wholly necessary but the prequel idea wasn't entirely played out at this point and this feature does a lot with the origins of interesting characters, unlike 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)' before it, and started the series in a new, and initially fresh, direction. 8/10.","

"X-Men: First Class","vaidya-abhishek","20 June 2011","After already creating four X-Men movies making a fifth one may be considered pushing it but instead X-Men: First Class came as a fresh surprise with a new perspective. For all not new to the X-Men this movie is a nice surprise as the plot look away from the classic 'human hatred towards mutants' story to a more mature and balanced story. rather than build up from the fame of the previous X-Men it starts fresh and allows the laymen audience to better understand the X-Men world and the characters.The best thing about X-Men: First Class is the fabulous manner in which the characters are introduced and developed. the audience may feel a bit lost in the beginning but the film quickly unravels. James McAvoy does a fantastic job of portraying Charles Xaviar with his casual charm and trusting voice. Michael Fassbender also provide the perfect contrast portraying Magneto as the mysterious character he is. that combined with a great cast make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining experience.","

"X-Men: First Class","gradyharp","17 September 2011","Having not followed the various forms of the Marvel Comics X MEN series except for a glance at Wolverine can be beneficial in watching this Prequel. The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.' James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, Álex González, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman. The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto. Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black. it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States. Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants. Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series can enjoy it as a 'beginning'. Grady Harp","

"X-Men: First Class","Dory_Darko","3 July 2011","Here on IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...Being a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. Another real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the ""old"" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.In case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy Finally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. With all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period.","

"X-Men: First Class","thesar-2","4 June 2011","Those who state X-Men: First Class is the best of the five X-men movies apparently haven't seen any of the first four.Admittedly, it's better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and everyone has a right to their own opinion, but come on. This movie suffers from being too long, too much story – for a superhero film, too little relevance and not enough of the exciting X-Men we've become accustomed to.Yeah, I'm aware it's an origin storyyet ANOTHER X-Men origin story (boy, do they like to tell origin stories verses just continuing onward, which I would prefer)but this came off way too much like another unnecessary prequel: Hannibal Rising.I don't want to sound too harsh, because First Class is superior to similarly scripted Hannibal's ""Fun with the Nazis"" Early Years. I'm just getting kinda sick of the back stories. In the previous four X-Men films we had bits and pieces of the history of the characters, but none as the exploited and blatant as Wolverine's. While I loved the character of Wolverine, it was refreshing that First Class chose NOT to explore, once again, how he got that adamantium or who created him or why he lost his memory orPLEASE tell me there isn't gonna be a Second Class film. Can you please do present tense? Do you have so little faith in the X-Men that they always have to go backwards and never forward? As much of a Superman fan I am, I would be thoroughly upset if the next four Supe movies deal with life on Krypton and/or yet another Smallville retelling. Move on!Further, in what is beginning to look like the George Lucas Space Saga, we keep going backwards after it began forwards with the original trilogy. 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine is set before the first three and this one, before that. Where are we headed? The ""evolved"" fish that leaves the sea and supposedly and eventually becomes man? (Ironically, there is, in fact, a mutant named ""Darwin"" in First Class.)That all said, the movie isn't exactly terrible. It absolutely could've been cut by a half hour –or any editing: the movie also suffered from poor editing. But the performances were decent, the ""surprise"" visits and homage was cute at points and the CGI/special effects were good.The basic plot revolves around the rise of (the soon-to-be Professor) Charles Xavier (James McAvoy – who, while good, is NOWHERE near the talent or charisma of Patrick Stewart), the revenge-filled Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender, who, AGAIN, isn't close to the performance of Ian McKellen and channeled a bit too much of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine) and the Cuban Missile Backdrop. Meanwhile, good/bad/indifferent/boring – especially the bad – mutants band together to come up with neat nicknames and explore their powers. Somewhat.While I did have fun when Charlie and his pal Erik find other similar mutants and further, when they're being ""trained"" while the two leads bicker, the rest of the movie was like a ""based on the series"" direct-to-DVD that is for fans-only and could easily only be watched once. I might watch again, but it would have to be a TV-edited version.As for the whole series, I vote for true believers to stick with the originals. X2: X-Men United is still the best, followed closely by the original X-Men. Even though, at first, I didn't care for the third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand, upon re-watching, I actually had a lot of fun during that. (If I had known what was coming, I would've appreciated it even more.)Skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine, for you see his ""origins"" in the previously mentioned films multiple times, anyways. And finally, for X-Men: First Class: it's worth a viewing, but it can certainly wait for it to hit home videoand for die-hard fans only.","

"X-Men: First Class","lasttimeisaw","7 September 2011","As most summer blockbusters have lost its credibility and novelty in recent years, this 120 minutes prequel gratifies me with its intricacy of different characters and the visual thumps (Magneto Vs. submarine scene is expressly phenomenal notwithstanding that it had been seen in the trailer). The overwhelming bromance between Professor X and Magneto has meshed well with the gay trend and indeed the film can be introduced as a mutants version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN without too much toil (taking account of the overtone of the similar social situation between gay and mutant), plus nearly all female characters are curbed as wallflowers (Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence) or stereotyped femmes fatales (January Jones, Zoe Kravitz). It's a man's world, even for mutants. A major merit is that the film magnificently applies the Cuban missile crisis into and plot and subsequently maneuvers a credible Cold War milieu, which according to the director Matthew Vaughn, he got the inspiration from earlier James Bond films. About the cast, James McAvoy plays a brainy-over-brawny hoot with ease while Michael Fassbender exudes a menacing characteristic which could widen his remit into an unprecedented area (2011 dooms to be his year, JANE EYRE, A DANGEROUS METHOD and SHAME, I bet at an Oscar nomination is unquestionably within his reach). The mutual attraction between them is mesmerizingly fruitful. But the villain Kevin Bacon is pigeonholed as a shallow badass which falls into the so-called Hollywood miscreant's formula, although his language versatility is the only saving grace. Still the film cannot or dare not to be a true alien from its kins or to be distinguished from other Marvel pics, hackneyed tactics are ubiquitous (compared with Vaughn's groundbreaking previous work KICK-ASS 2010), and some parts are tedious enough to bring about a tad repellence (notably the invincible Kevin Bacon Vs. human soldiers, and the assault on the mutant base, the slaughtering is purely annoying and corny). Now it is not clearly whether the film will reignite a further sequel since its the box office transcript is well underperformed. It's a pity that it is much more entertaining than THOR and the newest installment of the Caribbean pirates.","

"X-Men: First Class","shatteredrifle","7 June 2011","For those familiar with the X-Men movie franchise, X-Men: First Class is like drinking a glass of iced tea on a sunny day --- a nice break from all the complicated things that happened in the previous four movies. For first time viewers, it's a ticket to an alternate world full of beauty and hate, a world full of hope and fear.This is an example of a movie that was actually better than the trailer, an achievement in today's age of overly-hyped productions. First Class knew where it was headed and what points to hit. At the opening scene, we are sucked into young Magneto suffering at the hands of Nazis. Although this almost identical scene was already shown in the first X-Men movie, this gives us a chance to see where the struggle for mutant survival starts. Throughout the film, this struggle boils up and finally leads to the inevitable confrontation between humans and mutants. Matthew Vaughn did a great job in not making the film a teen whining fest. Instead, we are treated to a nice blend of action and story which makes you anticipate what will happen next. The cast of characters is diverse; some favorites like Mystique are brought back while lesser-known mutants like Banshee are given a chance to shine.This could hardly be called a breakout role for Michael Fassbender (300) given his performance in other films, but it sure has elevated his status to lead role material. He portrays Magneto with a deadly charm that actually makes you root for him. James McAvoy also did a solid job as Professor X. However, I cannot help but feel that First Class sympathizes more with Magneto than Professor X. We know of Magneto's past, and the movie focuses a great deal on his revenge against Shaw, but what about Xavier? We see him as a child, but not much more about his life that would make his character more interesting.The X-Men have always been a symbol of non-conformity, and that aspect is fleshed out excellently in First Class. In a world where being different is frowned upon, there are just these few who just stick out even they do not want to. Another good point of the film was that it was able to tackle the side of the humanity. Because humans are naturally resistant to change, they attack and try to eliminate something that they don't understand. In the end, they get to accomplish a sense of warped unity born out of fear, at the cost of alienating another group of species, the ""homo superior."" In a sense, First Class also shows humanity's own struggle for survival.Close-minded comic book fans may tend to dislike the film, seeing that it has deviated a lot from canon. For one, Beast is the only original X-Man (aside from Charles Xavier) featured in this film. However, this has opened a lot of doors for other people to actually get interested in the history of the group, a history so rich that it is almost impossible for a casual viewer not to be immersed in the lives of these mutants who just want to be who they were destined to be. Some may call this industry move mainstreaming, but being a comic book fan myself, I'd like to think of it as a big shout out to everyone that superhero movies have heart and are not just venues for amazing special effects.There was great expectation for X-Men: First Class, and for the most part, it has delivered. It proves there are a lot more stories to tell about these accidental heroes and villains, stories which will keep us at the edge of our seats and will make us crave for a whole lot more.","

"X-Men: First Class","snoozejonc","31 October 2021","Professor Charles Xavier and Eric Lehnsherr join forces to battle Sebastian Shaw.'X-men: First Class' is an very enjoyable origin movie that mixes character development and spectacle well.The story of Xavier and Lehnsherr does a great job of showing how their relationship evolves into what is portrayed in the original X-Men movies. As characters they are cleverly written depicting a parallel of each other's very opposite starts in life. This makes their differing attitudes towards humanity highly plausible.What makes it work so well are the excellent performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Depicting characters made famous on screen by other actors is difficult to achieve due to the obvious comparisons made. McAvoy actually feels like a younger version of Sir Patrick Stewart. Fassbender definitely does not feel like a young Sir Ian McKellen, but he puts his own take on the character that works fantastically well.As for the other characters, I found them to be solid. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Mistique, likewise Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw. Although Shaw is written as a fairly one-dimensional baddie, but we can't have everything.The alternative history element of the script is used quite cleverly by setting the main plot during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also the casting of January Jones, who at the time was playing another 60s alternative history icon Betty Draper, helps establish the period feel. There is some very 'Mad Men' like sexism thrown into some of the movie's dialogue.The visuals are as spectacular as you would imagine from a comic book movie. However, the general cinematography, editing and art design is top drawer. Some scenes with Lehnsherr using the imposing Magneto theme music are epic.Easily my favourite scenes involve Lehnsherr. The 5 reichsmark coin works brilliantly in a cinematic way to remind the viewer of his character motivations. It is similar to the use of the watch chimes in 'For A Few Dollars More'.Some parts are slightly frustrating. One element of the plot changes part of Xavier's backstory presented in a previous film. There is nothing wrong with this depiction of the event, but truly great writers are able to keep continuity and tell a great new story. There are some eye-rolling moments of characters speech-making, and the ""Mutant and Proud"" phrase is cringeworthy.For me it is a 8.5/10 but I round upwards.","

"X-Men: First Class","estebangonzalez10","17 June 2011","¨We have it in us to be the better man.¨ I will be honest with you guys: I didn't think this movie would work without Wolverine, after all he was the heart and soul of the previous X-Men films. Hugh Jackman was the reason why I had enjoyed the other movies so much and I thought this film would suffer without this main character (it would be like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack Sparrow). I was wrong! X-Men: First Class works really well as a prequel/reboot to the franchise for one main reason: The casting of Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy as the two lead characters: friends turned archenemies Magneto and Professor X. The relationship between these two characters and the two outstanding performances these talented actors give are what make X-Men: First Class the best superhero film since The Dark Knight. I know we have been bombarded with superhero films lately, and they are actually all pretty decent thanks to the strong background and depth these characters have been given in the comics, but this one is really worth your time. I loved the direction that Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Stardust, and Snatch) took with this film by letting the center of the plot revolve around the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Charles Xavier (Professor X). We really come to care for these two friends who we know will become enemies in the future, but can't help but root for them to get along in some way. Fassbender and McAvoy really deliver outstanding leading performances and the scenes between them are the heart of the movie. X-Men fans won't be disappointed.The movie begins during World War II as the Nazis are trying to separate young Erik from his parents. While they are taken away Erik begins to bend the metal fences with his mind until a soldier knocks him out. One of the Nazi officials named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) questions Erik before killing his mother in front of him since he is unable to move a metal coin. Later Sebastian discovers that Erik's powers only work when he is angry and therefore begins to train his prisoner. The movie then jumps to the present: it is 1962 and the world is at verge of another World War. Tension between the United States and Russia is high; the Cold War is at its boiling point. Sebastian is trying to take advantage of the situation and wants a nuclear war to begin. By his side he has some mutant friends: Emma Frost (January Jones) and Azazel (Jason Flemyng). On the meantime Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is after Sebastian and wants revenge. Erik isn't the only one after Shaw, an FBI agent, named Moira (Rose Byrne) discovers that he is trying to start a nuclear war and sees the mutants therefore she decides to investigate and discovers that a young student has done some extensive research on human mutation, his name is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Charles knows that there are many mutants with special powers like his in the world. He even adopted one and began to teach her how to deal with her power: Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), alias Mystique. Charles begins working with Moira in order to stop Shaw. He also befriends Erik and together they begin to round up other young mutants with special powers: Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Jones), and Darwin (Edi Gathegi).It was very interesting to see how the X-Men story began. The scenes where Erik and Charles teach the young mutants how to deal with their powers and master them remind us that these two guys are in a way very similar to each other. They both have great respect for one another; they are both excellent teachers and want to help their fellow mutants, but Erik never was able to deal with the pain of losing his parents and has grown resentful towards humans. This is what separates the two: one is motivated by hate, the other by grace. The same happens with the young mutants and there is no denying the fact that some will go along Erik's path, while others will follow Charles's. We all know that Magneto's brotherhood will be in constant battle with Professor Xavier's X-Men, but what we didn't know (at least film wise) was how the two groups went their separate ways. It is this friendship between the two main characters that we know will end, what builds the tension for a very satisfying finale. On a side note I really didn't care for the rest of the mutants. They were just that: secondary characters. What made the movie work entirely were these great scenes between McAvoy and Fassbender. The rest was just unremarkable in my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon gave good performances, but the truth is that the movie really revolved around Erick and Charles, and these two actors did a great job to make up for a somewhat mediocre script. I really enjoyed this reboot/prequel and it has taken the franchise to a whole new level.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"X-Men: First Class","tieman64","15 June 2011","The ""X-Men"" franchise works best as a giant chess game, in which one team of highly specialised mutants are pitted against another. Like chess pieces, each mutant has its own gifts, powers, counters and weaknesses, and each must swear allegiance to one of two kings: Professor Xavier, who fights for peace and a brotherhood between mutants and humans, or Magneto, a Nietzschean villain who sees mutants as the master race.Because of the ""chessboard"" nature of the ""X-Men"" source material, and the near-queer love affair between the opposing kings, the action in the early ""X-Men"" movies had an interesting tension. Many of the better moments in the previous films simply involved Xavier and Magneto jousting with words, sparring like modern Wizards, or eyeballing one another over a literal chessboard. Unfortunately none of the film's have particularly interesting scripts, and so eventually they all degenerated into big budget punch ups.The early ""X-Men"" comics mirrored the social movements and upheavals of the 1960s. Professor X and Magneto alluded to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and the comics did their best to include ethnically diverse characters. ""First Class"", set in the 1960s, was itself co-written by both a woman and a homosexual (writer Jane Goldman and Bryan Singer, director of the first two movies), and genuinely tries to grapple with Cold Wear era sexism, feminism and racism. Unfortunately the film was directed by Matthew ""Kick Ass"" Vaughn, a mediocre director who perverts every idea his writers cook up, and corrupts everything in the pursuit of his dumb notions of ""cool"".And so much of ""First Class"" uncritically features female mutants stripping down to their bras, panties, stockings, garters and high heels. Characters are either strippers or whores, whilst others are tied suggestively to beds and tortured. The script wants to align the Nazi's subjugation of Jews to the state sanctioned racism of super powers to modern sexism inside and outside the workplace (CIA agents are constantly belittling women etc), but Vaughn simply can't handle these things. The result is a wannabe James Bond film which salivates over its retro sexist narrative and plays up its racism and sexism for kitsch value (hence the presence of actress January Jones, who stars in the retro sexist ""Mad Men"").Still, some interesting ideas slip through Vaughn's fingertips. Rather than a saintly good guy, Professor Xavier becomes a cross between a sleazy pervert and a benign patriarch, and parallels are drawn between his treatment of women and the way other oafish men in the film treat women and minorities. Despite his lofty ideals, Professor X is a pimp, every bit as authoritarian as those he despises.The film tries to approach issues of race (a token black guy's death is meant to conjure up the ghosts of KKK cross/corpse burnings), but makes big missteps. Vaughn ensures that a team of white American superheroes ends up on Professor Xavier's side, whilst Magneto's ""brotherhood"" ends up being composed of everyone ""foreign"", black and female. The film then goes on to focus on Xavier's X-men rather than positioning us to empathise with Magneto and the plights of his minions. In villainizing and marginalising ""enemy mutants"", the series is guilty of exactly what it tries to condemn. It's a franchise angry at bigoted humans (who villainse the Other, all who are different), but which gets its kicks off whites beating up token, undeveloped evil mutants.In terms of action sequences, ""First Class"" is mostly useless. Bryan Singer's action scenes were rather special, using silence and tension well. Vaughn, however, has no spatial sense, eschewing elaborate set pieces in favour for plot excess, cheap shocks and snappy cuts. There isn't a single decent action scene here (a butterfly chasing a screaming kid? Seriously?).The first three ""X-Men"" movies starred two heavyweight actors as Magneto and Xavier: Patrick Stewart and the cunningly cast homosexual actor, Ian McKellen. Actor James McAvoy fills Stewart's big shoes well in ""First Class"", but Magneto's character is a mess, painted so demented and violent that all sympathy is lost. One of the best things about the ""X-Men"" franchise was the way humans, Xavier and Magneto all were, in a sense, ""right"", their actions somewhat justifiable. Here, however, Magneto nonsensically bounces from psycho to good-guy to raging psycho.Of course, the fact that Brett ""super hack"" Ratner directed the conclusion of Xavier and Magneto's relationship - Xavier's death in ""X-Men 3"" - makes following this new duo somewhat pointless. Ratner has already ruined these characters' history. Why follow them if their relational climax is ultimately in Ratner's hands? The film's plot is reheated Cold War nuclear missile nonsense (this is what sparked a global war between humans and mutants?), the kind of tale that bad B movies rendered stale long ago. Beyond this the film plays like a giant game of connect-the-dots, Vaughn too busy trying to tick boxes and link his film up with X-Men lore. Strange then that the film so heavily ignores X-Men continuity. Rather than long-time friends, Magneto and Xavier, in this film, know one another for a matter of moments, Vaughn singularly uninterested in their rich history, rivalry, friendship and relationship. Why make a prequel if you're simply going to rush through X-Men mythology and end up right back at the status quo? And why does the film rush toward robbing a young Xavier the use of his legs, when earlier X-films show Patrick Stewart walking when much older? In any case, Vaughn has achieved the extraordinary; he's made a film worse than Brett Ratner. ""First Class"" is just so new and shiny we don't realise it yet.7.5/10 – Worth two viewings.","

"X-Men: First Class","LinJason","1 June 2011","Some call this a brilliant franchise reboot, while others might say that it's the star of this summer thus far. I say that X-Men: First Class is a blockbuster mutant, one that sports the hybrid powers of a commercial box office cash cow, an entertaining spectacle, and a good film. Dramatically fueled by some great cast performance, X-Men: First Class makes sure that the message of being different and proud to be, gets across firmly.Usually from the first frame of the film, you'd know through some insane gut feeling if it'd be a good film. X-Men: First Class is one such film that sends good vibes as it begins in 1944's Poland during World War II. The first chapter of a young Erik Lehnsherr who is able to bend metal gates when emotionally charged, especially of grievance and anger.That very Erik, as most of us know it, will eventually become Magneto.Erik is well portrayed by Michael Fassbender who exudes a charismatic demeanour of a classic British spy/gentleman. In aid of simplifying that, think of him as a good resemblance to a young 007 - James Bond. Daniel Craig should be worried.Everything points towards that, with the Cold War setting and a offshore stand-off between the US and the Soviet Union in Cuban waters, two of the greatest powers in history. There's an innuendo hint at the real-life Cuban Missile Crisis as they used it to create tension, although not to suggest factual evidence.Wait, or did mutants actually had a part in it?That is very much so in the first two thirds of the film when Erik befriends a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who manages to inspire him to goodness that enlightened his magnetic potentials. Strength comes from somewhere between anger and serenity, that sentence alone underlined the core virtues and wise maturity of a young Professor X.Much like how Charles is the glue to all the mutants featured in this film, Director Matthew Vaughn (of Kick-Ass fame) did an exceptional job and inspired us that blockbusters aren't just a measure of blatant bang-bang-booms and exorbitant senseless sequences. In maintaining a great momentum and pace throughout the 132 minute blockbuster, he confiscated the entirety of the audience's attention span of interest and never giving back until the credit roll.There's a much desired focus on the story and character development (credits to a big team of story and screenwriters), which in my opinion is the greatest strength of the film that gives it a worthy edge over so many blockbusters that have revolved around the weary tried-and- tested formula. The dialogues were kept witty and at times amusing, which is uncommon of the one-liners often abused by summer blockbusters. Keep in mind that this is another Marvel superhero adaptation, so my expectations prior to the screening was somewhat along the line of a loud routine entertainment.I was so wrong about it.There's spectacular action when called for, but never saturated and overboard. Just what'll suffice and contribute to plot plausibility. For that, Vaughn gains my admiration and respect when most other blockbusters have the pressure of installing intentional crowd-pleasing plot devices with the ""more is more"" mentality when it's really just senseless overkill.All the action you'll find are very nicely coated by stellar visual effects (by the likes of Weta Digital) and scored by Henry Jackman's influential music. I'd also like to add that the score played a critical role in veiling this film with the intended serious overtone and gave it the right feel that also helps with setting the right rhythm. Think along the line of how music gave Avatar its atmospheric life and how it also made Inception feel so grand and mysterious. Production values are very high indeed, especially when you can expect a naval confrontation between an American fleet and a Soviet fleet disturbed by the play of mutants.Not all of the sideline mutant characters enjoyed adequate limelight in an attempt to avoid the overcrowding disruptive effect on the plot, but Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), and Emma Frost (January Jones) were given some and they made good of the opportunity. Some even offered the audience great eye-candy that doesn't feel forced upon.Before you'd begin to think that nobody remembers the bad guy, there's Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw (also the nightmare nemesis of Erik's ill-fated childhood) who really resembles an ambitious Hitler with menace. Memorable and rather short-lived in my opinion, but there's no doubt about Bacon's performance here (we're talking about a veteran here, after all).So there's a great cast, good star performance, alluring story, gripping pace, pleasant eye- candy, high production value, beautiful visual effects, and appealing action sequences. That doesn't sound like a blockbuster, it's a mutated form of it.Mutant and proud.Oh and that's not all, also do watch out for a crude brief cameo by a key familiarity.","

"X-Men: First Class","ryokan_wc","9 June 2011","A class on its own. The 'X-Men: First Class' definitely lives up to its expectations! If you have watched the rest of the X-Men movies, this movie explains and answers questions as it tells the origin of how the two sides formed: Prof X and Magneto. One of the best in its franchise and certainly, one of the greats from Marvel.The movie begins exceptionally well by introducing Charles and Erik at an early age. Charles lives in a well-to-do family and grows up with Raven (or Mystique). He earns his Professorship and studies mutant. James McAvoy, who plays Charles Xavier, stumbles in between the brink of war initiated by Sebastian Shaw (star Kevin Bacon). Micheal Fassbender who plays Erik Lehnsherr, or better known as Magneto, grew up with vengeance and sufferings in his heart, and his ultimate goal is to kill the man who killed his mother, Shaw.Charles meets Erik in one of his attempt to kill Shaw. They soon recruit more mutants on their side, coach them on their abilities and work together to stop Shaw from starting the war between America and Russia. Erik has another extra intention though. Amazing acting from the stars brought out the best of all the characters - Emma Frost, Beast, Banshee, Havok, to name a few in the movie.The development of this movie is great- a blend of high adrenaline pumping action scenes with depth on characterisation. We follow the lives and struggles of the mutants, silently standing on their side. Hugh Jackman makes a cameo appearance for Wolverine- keep you eyes open! The effects of the movie are sufficient to blow your mind away with missiles and explosions, tornado and waves.The great thing about X-Men movies, particularly in this latest one, is that it has a solid storyline that packs a punch, relives the characters from the comic and leaves every fan with a taste for more! Spectacular! Definitely an ideal pick for the weekend ahead.","

"X-Men: First Class","CinemaClown","15 October 2013","Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X-Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Eric Lensherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography & state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational music.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is very convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Eric Lensherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two men is what makes this film work so well along with fine support from the rest of its cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a wonderful score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one. Bring on X-Men: Days of Future Past.","

"X-Men: First Class","ThomasDrufke","3 March 2017","There are a lot of great things about First Class, but I think the one that sticks out to me the most (even after years and tons of viewings) is that it works as both a reboot and prequel. Even though the continuity has since been mingled with even more, this film did such a great job of resetting the universe without tarnishing what came before.In large part, the strengths of the film lie with Matthew Vaughn's direction. Up to this point, I liked most of the X-Men films, but even the people who have loved the series would say that there wasn't much ""fun"" to be had. The original X-Men trilogy took itself very seriously and rightfully so. But there's something to be said for a mutant story that poses similar thought provoking questions and themes like before, while also making a fun adventure out of it. Vaughn does a wonderful job balancing the two.Setting an X-Men film in the 1960's meant having to recast all of the recurring characters. Luckily, casting was something 20th Century Fox had no problem with. I don't think we could have dreamed of a better pairing to take over the roles of Professor X and Magneto than James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Perhaps, some would say that the two of them have outdone their counterparts, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (I, myself being one of those people). Much like the film itself, McAvoy and Fassbender put their own spin on the characters, but bring enough similarity in their performance to understand the connective tissue between the pairs.Something the new trilogy of X-Men films does incredibly well is use the decade the films are set in to enhance the overall story they were going for. First Class is set in the 60's, and uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as the film's climatic sequence. But it uses it in a way that doesn't exploit that event, instead, gives a reason for there to be tension between Charles & Erik. This film and Days of Future Past nail the relationship between those two more so than any X-Men film to date.Going back to the fun stuff though, the rest of the mutants are made up of mostly throw away heroes and villains. No one was really asking for characters like Azazel, Riptide, Angel Salvadore, Havoc, Darwin, Banshee, or even more Mystique. But even as much as these characters could have felt like throwaway characters, Vaughn managed to build them into the story in a creative way. Everyone has their own arc and moment to shine. In fact, my favorite part of the film involves Charles & Erik recruiting, and subsequently training everyone. It's classic superhero stuff.Overall, First Class makes good with its new cast and setting. Matthew Vaughn transitioned what was originally planned as a Magneto origin story into a wonderfully balanced comic-book adaptation. One that nails the characters motivations and mindsets in a refreshing but respectful and realistic way. +Charles & Erik+Recruiting & Training+Score+Vaughn's directing+Setting adds to the story9.4/10","

"X-Men: First Class","Sisiutil","12 January 2013","The best scene in X-Men: First Class is, arguably, the brief cameo by Hugh Jackman/Wolverine. Unfortunately, that scene also undermines much of the logic of the film.Just in case you aren't aware of it, a young Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) encounter Wolverine in a bar as part of their efforts to recruit mutants to a team they're forming. They introduce themselves; he promptly and rudely tells them to go away, which they promptly do. It's a very short, very funny scene, a crowd-pleaser, and arguably one of the best scenes in the film, if not the best. It also, unfortunately, ruins the movie.I can live with a prequel introducing continuity errors into a franchise, which X-Men: First Class does. I can live with an adaptation from another medium making significant changes to established characters--again, the film does this several times. What I cannot accept, however, is a film where supposedly intelligent characters repeatedly make stupid decisions, committing the same mistake over and over, and thereby undermine all their efforts to achieve their goals.Back to that scene and how it illustrates this problem. Assuming that at least some of the facts about Logan from the comics and X-Men Origins: Wolverine are still true in this semi-reboot, Logan is an extremely experienced and talented fighter who is over 150 years old at the time of this story. Xavier and Lehnsherr are going up against a team of powerful, mature mutants, and yet they abandon recruiting this formidable warrior after a one-sentence brush off. Instead they bring in a group of children, essentially, who are under-powered and/or have little to no control over their powers. It logically would have taken years to shape those X-cadets into anything resembling a potent fighting force--time which, according to the logic of the story, Xavier and Lehnsherr didn't have.And frankly, the kids aren't very interesting characters. Even if the scene with Wolverine had been dropped to avoid calling attention to the problem I've outlined, it still wouldn't help this charisma-challenged first X-Men team. The movie works best when it focuses on Xavier and Lehnsherr and their complex friendship. The writers could have left out the X-babies and just used Prof X and Magneto and we'd have a much better film. Either that or they should have been recruiting a group of older, more experienced mutants who would have been more of a match out of the gate for Shaw and his cabal.There were some things I liked about this film (mainly the Xavier/Magneto bromance, but also the many exciting action sequences) and others I didn't (such as the awkward insertion of anti-mutant sentiment, January Jones' underwhelming portrayal of Emma Frost, Mystique's under-written motivation for joining Magneto, the many anachronisms such as Banshee's hairstyle, etc.) Overall, I was disappointed because with a few simple changes X-Men: First Class could have been a much better movie. The first two X-Men films still haven't been equalled. Bryan Singer, come back to the director's chair, we miss you!","

"X-Men: First Class","pauli10","29 April 2012","This is not a good film but let's start with the plot. Set during the Cold War, a mutant named Shaw (that rhymed :) ) is attempting to start a nuclear war between America and Russia in order to wipe out all humans and leave the remaining mutants to live amongst the cockroaches. I'm not entirely sure how Shaw expects the mutants to eat, drink and live on an ashen bum hole of a planet but I digress. Cue the X-Men and perhaps one of the cheesiest films to ever get a high grade on IMDb.The dialogue is, in a word, cheesy. With actors doing the best with what they have, for the most part. Michael Fassbender's fantastic interpretation of an Irish Magneto really is distracting as you try to work out at what point the German Jew picked up his Gaelic lilt. It's okay though as Fassbender lets it go from time to time just to play with our minds.As mutants go there is a decent array of unique mutants that at least makes a change from the three films that preceded it. Though I felt some were a little weak and, well, looked a little silly. Banshee in particular seemed able to crack glass but in a fight situation relied on flying away from danger. Look out for the first time Banshee learns to fly and the appalling CGI employed. On the whole they all felt a little weak with the exception of Beast and Havoc. Even here, these mutants feel under used. Accepting that they are merely learning their powers and very young I expected them to be used more, for fighting yes, or learning about their characters, the film does neither.There is little in the way of character depth here with only Magneto really been a fully realised character. I don't think the actors can be blamed here. Without spoiling anything, look out for Mystique/Raven's fantastic heart wrenching (sarcasm) scene when she must decide between A MAN SHE HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE WITH AND WHO COULD BE DYING and another guy who just tried to kill everyone.The film also contains a training montage...need I say more? With a plot that makes you go, ""He's planning what..?"", dialogue that makes you cringe and underutilized mutants, X-men first class is disappointing.","

"X-Men: First Class","reeseslightning","20 September 2011","Overall, I could've really enjoyed this movie but there are too many confusing points. *minor spoilers*First, let's go over what annoyed/confused me:1. The ending. Okay, we all know that Professor X is paralyzed eventually. Yet, in this film, he's supposed to be paralyzed at a young age but in X-Men: The Last Stand, he's seen walking with Magneto to Jean Grey's house and in X-Men: Wolverine, he's standing by the plane as the mutants come from the building. So which one is it?2. Mystique and Professor X grew up together???? Where on earth did that come from? For two people who were so close in their youth/young adulthood, I find that to be yet another inconsistency that takes away from the story. The whole time I could only think, ""Why does Professor X and Magneto have such a complicated bromance in the first trilogy if they knew each other for only a few weeks, but there is zero mention of Mystique and Professor X when they've known each other their whole lives?"" 3. Um, what happened to the lifelong friendship between Professor X and Magneto? In X-Men: The Last Stand, we see Professor X and Magneto are seen as still friends because they go to together to Jean Grey's house. Yet, the ending shows that the pair's friendship ended on the beach in 1962.4. Emma FrostI get January Jones' character in the film. Really, I do. Every film needs its cliché blonde bombshell that does nothing except run around in skimpy clothes. But! Wasn't Emma Frost in X-Men: Wolverine as a 17 yr old (give or take a year)? What happened to her sister? What happened to her after she was caught by Professor X and Magneto?There are too many loose ends and not enough answers to questions that have been raised.Okay, now let's get to the good points:1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy in the same movie? Yay!!!! To me, Michael Fassbender can do no wrong and the casting of these two were brilliant. 2. Miscellaneous.Okay, the special affects were super cool(except Emma Frost's diamond effect is way different than in Origins) and the mutants were pretty awesome. Granted, I know these names are supposed to mean something, but I never got a chance to know them due to the massive amount of rushing through the story lines. 3. CameosThere were several nice surprises from Hugh Jackman to Rebecca Romajin. They added a little something familiar to the story, even if they were totally unnecessary and added to the confusion of the timeline (Wolverine).Overall, I liked the movie. But if the writers had actually watched the original trilogy and thought through the connections, I'm sure it would have been even better. I liked the casting, but the actual storyline went from an origin story, to a story that resembled a learning community(meaning, we got to see Professor X actually help these mutants and we saw them bond), to a cliché 'let's foil the villainous take over the world plan' and then rushed back to a 'this is why the x men/brotherhood have a love/hate relationship' story.It could've been so much better if they had focused one of the three story lines. Personally, I found the best part of the movie was watching Xavier work with the mutants. They should have taken a different, less confusing road with the ""First Class"" idea. I gave it 4 stars because the parts I did like, were brilliantly done but everything else came between them and ruined the fun. Now, I'm left scratching my head trying to piece together the connections.","

"X-Men: First Class","moviemavens","11 June 2011","The original ""X-Men"" in 2000 propelled the meteoric rise of superheroes into the next decade and beyond. The first installment was followed up by a spectacular second, ""X2."" Unfortunately, the third, ""The Last Stand"" (with the change of director from Bryan Singer to Brett Ratner) fell flat. Crammed with too many characters, it's big on style and nothing else. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has its moments. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Kick-Ass"") with Singer's return as a producer brings back the ""X-Men"" that fans worship.""First Class"" is more of the origin story of the future Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen). They're young men learning about who they are, what they're capable of, discovering their superpowers and others like them, and where they stand in the world.The story opens in Nazi's concentration camp, where metal-bending Erik Lehnserr (Michael Fassbender, ""Pride & Prejudice""), as a little boy, was separated from his family. Discovered as a mutant by a psychopathic doctor (Kevin Bacon), he's forced to mentally move a coin and fails, resulting in the tragic death of his mother. What follows is a terrifyingly powerful scene as Erik's power is unlocked by rage. He carries this deep-rooted anger to adulthood, turning into a vengeance-seeker and later a full-blown villain.Telepathic Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, ""Wanted"") grows up in a sprawling, remote estate. One day he finds Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a shape-shifting blue mutant, masquerading as his mother in his kitchen. Since then they live together like brother and sister. There's a glimpse of their university days, where Charles is quite a charmer with the co-eds and eventually becomes a renowned professor in genetics mutation.A CIA agent, Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) stumbles upon the existence of mutants while in pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), which turns out to be the same Nazi doctor who killed Erik's mother. Sebastian is also a mutant, with the power to absorb and release energy force. He's accompanied by diamond-encrusted Emma Frost, twister-spinning Riptide, tailed devil Azazel.An underwater incident leads Charles to Erik, where Charles saves his life. From then on their friendship grows. Erik's intensity is balanced by Charles' calming influence. They travel together to track down the other mutants - wing-sprouting Angel (Zoe Kravits), ear-splitting Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), ape-like Beast (Nicholas Hoult), evolving Darwin (Edi Gathegi), fiery Havok (Lucas Till). Their relationships with the mutant proteges display their mentoring ability. The training at Charles' estate to control and manipulate their powers for good provides some of the lighthearted scenes.Even with a common bond, Charles and Erik's ideological differences drive them apart. Charles believes that mutants and humans can co-exist peacefully, whereas Erik seeks to destroy for fear of being dominated.With Sebastian playing the United States and Russian governments to start World War III, the world now discovers the mutants and their abilities during the showdown off the Cuban coast. Erik is most powerful with Charles' assistance when he can find that place mentally between rage and serenity. Sebastian meets his demise in a fitting fashion.Once the missile crisis is averted, however, the humans, united by the fear of the unknown, turn against the mutants. With Erik out of control, Charles tries everything in his power to turn around the situation. Charles is struck and ends up paralyzed. The moment comes when the mutants, influenced by their own personal experiences, must choose side in determining the future of the human race.The retro design and archival news footage provide ""First Class"" an authentic feel. It's unfortunate that it's missing a few of the main mutants; most notably Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean Gray. If you blink, you'd miss a surprising cameo or two.It's a thrill to see the superb special effects be put into exhilarating use; the interesting mix of superpowers, an anchor ripping off a ship, submarine and missiles suspended in the air. But that's not what makes ""First Class"" a real first class. It's a lot more than good versus evil. The dynamics of Charles and Erik's intense friendship, underlined by solid acting, is the strongest point. The genuine human emotions and implications - rage, pain, agony, fear, isolation and longing - to be ""normal,"" to be tolerated for being different and be accepted in society are the pillars of the story.An extraordinary blast from the past, ""X-Men: First Class"" will go down as one of this decade's best superhero movies!The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)","

"X-Men: First Class","Ryan_MYeah","24 October 2011","I guess the way to start this review is to tell you what I thought of the other films. I thought the first two films were great. Then came the dreaded downgrade in quality that was The Last Stand. I thought the Wolverine film was enjoyable, but flawed overall. This new entry is now a pleasant return to form.Rebooting the time line of the series to the days of the Cold War, the film follows the early days of the founding X-Men, Charles Xavier (Played by James McAvoy), a highly intelligent telepath, and Erik Lensherr (Played by Michael Fassbender), a man with the powerful ability to control metal. Once they meet, they form a team of others like them, those with extraordinary abilities (otherwise known as mutants). But danger starts to arise when an enemy team of mutants, led by the powerful Sebastian Shaw (Played by Kevin Bacon), begins to initiate a chain of events that would begin World War 3 unless the X-Men can stop them.First Class not only excels as an action movie, but also manages to feel fleshed out, and three dimensional, instead of feeling like a monotonous back to back action set piece. Director Matthew Vaughn and the film's powerful cast give the film an unusual heart, specifically between the complicated friendship between Xavier and Lensherr (McAvoy and Fassbender are a perfectly matched duo). But let's not forget the film's attention to other themes, such as prejudice and conformity. The narrative is not always perfect, and Fassbender has brief habits of slipping in and out of accent, but everything manages to be solid.As far as action goes, this a fun ride to sit through. Each action sequence is impeccably paced by Lee Smith (The marvelous editor of Inception), including the film's epic and enrapturing third act. There's also a stylistic attention to visual detail, whether it be the elegant production design, the well done visual effects, and fantastic makeup and sound design. Oh, and I also got a kick out of a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman.First Class is the best of the comic book summer, and I give it *** out of ****","

"X-Men: First Class","honorhorror","3 June 2011","Before I went into cinema for X-Men:First Class, a few media reviews really had cranked up my expectations. So, let's be honest, and say that this movie was so close to meet my expectations. The filmmakers did a fantastic job knitting up everything in the first act, made it very character-driven. Nothing in the first 40 minutes makes you feel half-cooked because neither Charles' nerd personality nor Eric's washed-up revenger aura ever feels old. The whole movie basically feeds you with a great sense of retrospective spy movie. The same approach was at its peak in another superhero marvel--The Incredibles. It works fantastic if you factor in the fact that X-men:First Class is not a cartoon. There are action sequences set throughout the movie deliberately minimizing the use of CGI, which added significant believability to the film. The 2nd act, which to my surprise, didn't really slow down for character-building. The movie is fantastic in bringing actions and characters to a balance, which worked just like the first two X-men films. I was ready to be bombarded by the massive amount of CGI in the climax of the film, which if not for the restraining, smart usage of special effects during the first half, would not be so obviously artificial. That issue, along with my hectic expectations for the drama between Charles and Eric did make the climax of the film a bit, uh, unsatisfying. I was really thinking about if they can wrap up everything until Charles said half-mockingly, ""I'd soon be bald.""The new Mystique, played by beautiful Jennifer Lawrence, was at the heart of the whole drama side of this action film. Mystique's character building was maybe the best compared to the main guys, Charles and Eric. Mystique's struggles of identity crisis, despite its cartooned roots in X-Men universe, is heartfelt. It's especially true to those living in a multi-ethnic environment. Mystique was so outstanding that both Charles and Eric had left something to be desired, in my opinion. Charles and Eric on the other hand, felt like they were already in their full-blown form. It's kind of hard not to factor in my own interpretations and assumptions when I tried to appreciate their development. At last, the movie is complemented with a great score. 8/10. Way to go, X-Men. If you like to hear about my interpretation about Charles, please feel free to read on.So, here's my interpretation about Charles's development in First Class. Charles was born in the upper class of his world, which formed his view of the world and mindset in a mainstream way. His mind-reading abilities allowed him to walk in the rains of social life without getting wet, which formed his illusion of being the mighty leader/father figure of mutants. If not for Magneto, he'd probably never feel the pain of belittled, incompetent, and incomplete. His disability to walk, along with the loss of his sister, aka Mystique, humbled him and sent him on the way to be closer to the a father figure/authentic peacemaker. Alas for Charles, no matter how many times he had read Mystique's mind, there were actually more delicate matters than he could fathom that was going on in her. Don't we, the self-respected intellectuals often do the same with our families? We sometimes feel like what's truly important is only arm's length away, yet in our frustration we turn to pervert or twist it. If that's the case for you, then may God help us as he helped Professor X.","

"X-Men: First Class","faisal_khatib","9 June 2011","Prequels are so flawed in their concept that they suffer from the feeling of predictability. This can weigh down a film if it isn't one that gives its viewers a ride of a life time. X-Men: First Class not only stays afloat, but shines at that with some thrilling action/emotions, a tight script, fantastic chemistry between the lead actors and excellent special effects.First Class was always about establishing the base to the original trilogy but the way this was done is remarkable. The movie starts out with a prologue staged during WWII that shows the childhood of Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) growing up in the comforts of home in New York while discovering his power and a little sister/friend in the form of Raven (played by Morgan Lily), and Erik Lehnsherr (Bill Milner) locked up in a concentration camp where he meets doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who kills Erik's mother to force a magnetic reaction out of him fueled by rage.Fast forward to the 1960's with the Cuban Missile crisis around the corner, Charles (James McAvoy) is en-route to becoming a professor of genetics while Erik (Michael Fassbender) is clawing his way towards Shaw for revenge. What follows next are a series of events that results in Charles saving Erik's life. Thus begins the drama between the two lead characters that is the heart of the movie. The chemistry they share with their humorous interaction, their clash of ideologies and their general perspective of the future is beautifully scripted.The character transition from a proud but naïve Xavier to selfless Professor X; an angry and confused Erik to a powerful Magneto and an unsure Raven to a proud mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is handled with utmost care and aptness. The casting was spot on with all three actors delivering a convincingly flawless act.Support comes in the form of Hank McCoy aka Beast (Nicholas Hoult) whose constant struggle (along with Raven) to undo his physical mutation for better acceptance into the society is a shot at how humans perceive, alienate and fear anyone with visible or invisible abnormalities. Nicholas Hoult as the geeky super intelligent Hank is believable and it was great to see this child artist mutate into a full grown actor. Him as Beast was a letdown as the makeup seemed to be a hindrance for dialogue delivery plus his act wasn't as convincing as Kelsey Grammar in X-Men: The Last Stand.Moira MacTaggert (Rose Bryne) is the sole human connection in the movie who believes that there is indeed something good that can come from the mutant race. Sean Cassidy/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) is the nervous teenager unable to channel his powers and unsure how he could use it to do any good. Caleb looks and acts the part though his action scenes were a little unimpressive. Alex Summers/Havok (Lucas Till) is the volatile one due to the lack of control over his powers. Not much acting was required from Lucas apart from making sneer comments and looking pretty, which he did quite well. Armando Muñoz/Darwin (Edi Gathegi) was a short act and Edi impressed.Moving on to the dark side, Sebastian Shaw through money, mutant powers and fear, puppeteers the American and the Russian governments/army to make moves enraging each other towards an eminent nuclear war that would destabilize humankind. Kevin in the opening scene as the doctor in the concentration camps is manically brilliant with what sounded like perfect German. Unfortunately his character as the *energy sucking* mutant was a 'typical super hero film villain' but then that is what he was.Emma frost (January Jones) as Shaw's mind reading crystallizing side-kick was like watching a plank with curves. Her lingerie scenes make up for the eye candy of the film and that's about it, there's nothing more to her character. Janos Quested/Riptide (Álex González) and Azazel (Jason Flemyng) were Shaw's henchmen; lots of mutant action but not much say, which was a waste of two good actors. Riptide didn't have a single line in the whole film. Angel Salvadore (Zoë Kravitz) was the 'good girl gone bad' mutant who wants to stop hiding. Apart from being an angry/abused girl there wasn't more to her character either.As expected, there are plenty of action scenes in the film, giving each character enough time to show off their powers. The graphics and visuals are spectacular as well, though the soundtrack takes a backseat in comparison. There are a couple of cameo roles in the film as well, one of which induces big laughs from the audience with just one line.Director Matthew Vaughn's choice to give utmost importance to the relationship between Xavier and Erik; their verbal battles and inevitable differences has managed to make this movie more than just a comic book action film. Even the uncertainty Hank and Raven share is a nice side story that makes you feel their anguish and connection. Vaughn's ability to create a whole new universe with a mixture of facts and fiction makes you wonder what really happened in reality. Kudos to him for bringing this stale franchise back to life.","

"X-Men: First Class","slightlymad22","24 September 2014","In X-Men: First Class we meet Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were enemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Especially Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and McCavoy, but for me the star of the show is Kevin Bacon. He is delightfully devious. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Oliver Platt also deserves special mention too.Prequels that totally recast popular characters are always on shaky ground, but given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience. X-Men: First Class is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for almost perfect entertainment.","

"X-Men: First Class","aaroncrews","23 June 2011","Man V. Freak Evolution has a new name By Ryan Crews 3.5/4 StarsThere once was a tale of a more evolved human kind. A band of outcasts known as the future: the mutant kind. Their story has been and continues to be told through an up and running X-Men franchise, made fresh by its latest installment, X-Men: First Class. First Class is a world class prequel that exposes the pasts of two old chums (as they are seen in the original films: X-1, 2, & 3). Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (a five-star performance by Michael Fassbender) and Charles Xavier/Professor X (a jolting James McAvoy) join forces to defeat the energy absorbing antagonist, Sebastian Shaw (an evil-intent Kevin Bacon) and his squad of mutant baddies with mutant domination on their mind. The film delves into Fassbender's (Inglorious Basterds) medal-bending maniac's soul-driven desire for revenge against the Nazi regime that stole away his family and into McAvoy's (Atonement) telepathic visions of a mutant and human co-existence. As Lehnsherr misinterprets fascist hatred as the foundation of all human nature, his innocence is lost which develops the passion of Magneto's inner Frankenstein monster. The hatred brewed turns him into the very same prejudiced man that he preys upon, impervious to McAvoy's philanthropic attempts at getting in his head. The direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) pays homage to Bryan Singer's take on the first two films which adds a depth to the X-Men that had not shown up in the past two installments (The Last Stand and Wolverine). Its storyline is as intriguing as a superhero plot gets. It plants the X-Men straight into the 60's Cuban Missile Crisis and morphs history to its advantage to add to the powerful effect of the film, and the effect is groovy baby. Nicholas Hoult is ferocious as the mad scientist, Hank McCoy/Beast. He comes in and leaves a mark almost as if asking what would a comic book movie be without the nerds? The only weak side of the acting pool comes from Mrs. Betty Draper herself, January Jones (Mad Men) who plays a very comic book feeling villain known as Emma Frost. Frost could have been a dynamic, cinematic creation if only Jones didn't look like she was just there to look hot and read her lines. First Class is full of spectacular visual effects, intense, crafty acting (congrats, Fassbender for the role of the year, so far) and cerebral summer fun without all of the worries of skin cancer. It's an enthralling ride that gets in your mind like Xavier himself as it is full of freaks, geeks, and mystique's (pun intended, nerds). It's totally worth a single days pool-fair.","

"X-Men: First Class","fernandoschiavi","2 October 2016","X-Men: First Class is the best film about the mutants of all five adaptations to the big screen, with the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, focused more on the most famous mutant Marvel. This film is actually a prequel, with its events occurring well before the films adapted in year 2000. Here we are in full '60s, and Professor Charles Xavier in the newly formed college holds a post-graduate work at the United Nations and this time he get to know Erik Lehnsherr, son of Jews killed during World War II. Erik was spared by Sebastian Shaw who killed his mother in front of him after he fails to raise a coin as he had done with little gates before when he had been separated from their parents. The goal of Shaw was to provoke the fury of the boy who soon after showed all his power a little short. When the two meet years later, they seek to combat Shaw, which is a mutant and says that the mutants arose from genetic alterations caused by nuclear war and what made humans to kill, made them stronger mutants. So he sought to turn Russians against Americans against each other to cause the 3rd World War that the mutants could easily succumb to the mutants, which would be the dominant species on Earth. So friends, Charles and Erik start to gather some mutants to use their powers for peaceful purposes and decide to open the School for Gifted Young.Directed by Matthew Vaughn competent (""Stardust (2007)"" and ""Kick Ass (2010)""), the great asset of this latest adventure of the mutants is acclimate the plot in a way and in a credible and realistic scenario to address once again the acceptance of mutants of human and place a political scene of history as background, in this case the missile crisis in Cuba. This more realistic narrative and more threatening to humans on the brink of a war that makes the film so interesting.Vaughn constructs Charles as safe, firm and have full control of his powers already implying right away that would be the natural leader of the X-Men, as seen in previously released movies, Erik shown uncertain of his real ability with Charles help find the right spot so you can have full control of their ability, as Erik needs a better balance he should get some good feeling not to be with his kind with anger already present inside against humanity because he feels If guilty for having lost his mother because of his powers. This fact is probably the main factor that Erik does not believe that mutants can live in harmony with humans, because of this resentment. The comedy is still present, certain fact in other films, but on a smaller scale. The scene shows that's when the young mutants come together to demonstrate their powers, but sarcasm and irreverence Wolverine are not present but its rapid participation is more than special. Also part of these scenes of mood most part of specific training with interesting scenes. The strange thing is that even with one or two mutants attempts before unprepared and to be polished, already dominated masterfully control of his powers, but to give rhythm to the film is even understandable.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are by far the best long attractions and dominate their roles, especially the latter who knew every look pass threat, anger and impressiveness of his character in an excellent interpretation. Besides the two, appear several other interesting mutants, but also get a good highlight is the Mystique / Raven talented and beautiful Jennifer Lawrence who lives the film with the dilemma of whether to accept as mutant and trying not to hide, as it did during all his life. This important and more human conflict that we explains why she chose to stand by Magneto worth mentioning in this script. Conflict that only an actress with such depth as Lawrence could pass. Besides her other characters also go through this conflict tired of prejudice and hide, as the character Hank McCoy ""Beast"" played by Nicholas Hoult, previously seen in older X-Men: The Final Conflict. Kevin Bacon is also noteworthy to us to present a character typically eccentric villain and not so stereotypical. It is he who has the most powerful mutants in principle, the creator of the most dazzling and annihilating idea, a submarine ""hi-tech"" and still have the coldness and sarcasm required in any villain coming from the comics.Excess mutant characters is repeated in this new adaptation, but I do not think in this case they have become loose and contribute to the progress and dramas of the characters. The effects are fantastic and are used sparingly, without exaggeration. The great merit of direction was not to the effects the main attraction, especially for not having the actors of the previous films and have several new talents in front of him. Would try to compensate for the lack of names as well known with an effects show, but it was not the case. The development of the characters happens gradually and well done and the effects are inserted only at key times with extreme competence.But many more fans of the characters noticed and did not like anything more creative liberties taken by the writers and producers to tell the story. However, X-Men: First Class knew to be a fun movie, full of action, adventure, effects and certain mood and mix well all this with a serious drama and existential conflicts over prejudice and ideological with different paths to follow in a world that is not prepared to deal with mutants, in certain times and in an important situation in the context of humanity. Matthew Vaughn delivers the pure entertainment in just over two hours.","

"X-Men: First Class","manendra-lodhi","29 October 2012","Why I have considered this one as the best of all the X-men films, is that the story was the best among all. Other films were concentrated on the conflicts between, the two gangs but this one developed emotions and friendship properly. The franchise has rebooted the series with a prequel. The story is about the early lives of Professor X and Magneto. I must say that Michael fassbender as magneto has looked very authentic. In fact the entire cast has done a wonderful job as far as the acting is considered. The feeling to see magneto and professor X working together was awesome. They would have made an awesome team. The differences were genuine and to me both looked right in their own places. It is full of action.PROS: Raising some thought provoking questions; the film is a piece to watch at least once. If the human race is going to meet some of these mutants in reality than obviously, normal people would fear from them. They have powers with which they are lifting submarines from the sea. How could humans feel safe living with them? This is an important question because humans cannot consider them equal to them and live peacefully. It is imperative that man is an animal in all ways and these mutated people will someday lose sanity and start doing weird things. There is no way of convincing humans that we will be safe forever. On the other sides if we see it from the point of mutants, they are also not wrong in thinking that humans will try to destroy them someday. Professor X plays the role of a saint in this. But it is nearly impossible for him to control everything. I am with Humans on the subject.The visuals are satisfactory and the film is not crowded with them unnecessarily. The story is the backbone of the film. You'll eventually want for more. The cinematography is good especially in the end and all fights. The new characters had proper time based on their capabilities. The film has done true justice to its purpose of introducing the two major characters of the franchise.CONS: The film in the second half seemed to rush a lot. The training and everything was going so fast that it looked to be a race to complete the film. 20 more minutes wouldn't have been a bad idea.MESSAGE: ""Everyone needs friends."" VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""","

"X-Men: First Class","jedi-jones","5 June 2011","You know there's a problem when you start making up MST3K-style gags in the middle of a movie. X5 has a good opening sequence and goes steadily downhill from there. There is some solid acting and a couple of exciting scenes, but the plot gets more implausible and the characters more laughable with each passing moment. Eventually you realize you're not going to see anything new, that this is as predictable as the typical prequel, and that your time is best spent making up jokes.It's not good when the most memorable image from the movie is Kevin Bacon wearing Magneto's helmet. This is not something that longtime X-Fans have been dying to see on the big screen as far as I know. Aside from the decidedly unthreatening helmet, Bacon would have been a better villain if he spoke with a German accent the whole time as he did in the introduction. The filmmakers forgot a basic rule of pulp films which is that foreign accents equal villainy.They also forgot another rule of comic book movies, which is that ""comic panel""-style scenes are stupid, as Ang Lee's Hulk demonstrated. Yeah, we get it, this is based on a comic book. We don't need to be hit over the head with it. They also spent too much time focusing on how the characters' names get made up, a now tiresome comic book movie cliché.Other than Xavier, Magneto and Mystique's story lines, which are largely rehashed from the previous films, there's almost nothing that works as drama here. The march to Nuclear War was as contrived as I've ever seen that done. I honestly think Superman IV did a better job by just having Lex sneak up and push the launch button himself. X5 asks us to believe that all you have to do to start nuclear war is threaten/buy off/seduce two generals (or whoever). As if neither countries' presidents nor other officials have any say in the matter, but are just puppets of these two guys. The powers-that-be then do stuff that's so despicable, Professor X looks like a dolt for continuing to have faith in humanity. It brings to mind Dark Helmet's point about evil always triumphing because good is dumb.More rehashing comes when this movie sloppily shoehorns in a redo of the ""cure"" subplot from X3. Beast claims he can normalize his appearance yet retain his powers. But since his powers are a physical ability caused by his body being in the mutated shape that it is, what he says makes absolutely no sense.First Class also suffers from the old ""Submarine Crew"" problem of having a bunch of characters that are necessary to perform functions in the story, but are woefully underdeveloped. Half the characters here serve no purpose other than to be special effects. I think even Professor X realizes his new recruits are disposable, since he almost kills one of them in some reckless training exercises without giving it a second thought. The movie signals that it doesn't consider the new characters important by putting together an extremely slapdash special effects sequence to introduce them.Then there's the ""Batman Begins"" problem of running out of decent new characters to introduce since they're up to the 5th movie already. Hence we end up with a ""G.I. Joe: The Movie (1987)"" Big Lob-esque mutant who has the strangest, most inexplicable and illogical power since Spider-Man's spider sense...at least the version that was so sensitive it could warn Spidey if he wrote a bad check. His power to basically ""do anything he needs to do when he needs to do it"" strains credibility as much as it induces humor. There's usually something off about new characters written into an adaptation that weren't vetted through the normal channels the pre-existing characters were. If you recall, Big Lob's great military specialty in G.I. Joe was that he could dribble grenades like a basketball, or something.Worse yet, every somewhat interesting new character is dispensed with perfunctorily. Instead of having a big psychic face-off between White Queen and Xavier as a change of pace from shooting, kicking and punching, she's all but forgotten about. Much more could have been made of the human allies of the mutants, but the Bill Richardson-esque CIA agent and Moira basically vanish after they perform their duty in the plot, one of them in the most anticlimactic way since what happened to Xavier in X3.Let's also consider X-Stripper, whose power is that she can give you one hell of a ""buzz"" in the champagne room. She makes me question the strategy of rounding up every single mutant to create this elite task force. Let's say there was a mutant who had the power to pass enough gas to stink up an entire aircraft carrier. Would they want him on the team too?There remain lingering questions. How do the X-Men operate their jet without being shot down? How does Beast single-handedly build the thing in the first place? Exactly what happens to all the energy that one character absorbs at one point? I feel like I was cheated out of a big explosion here. How exactly would Xavier pull off eluding the CIA? Shouldn't he set up shop outside a Pakistani military base to be more inconspicuous?This movie is ridiculous enough that with one slight nudge it could become a raucous comedy. One mistake was not deflating some of the hot air by putting more humor in the movie. There's only one funny line and few attempts to create any kind of comic relief. This series needs to lighten up. Or at least do something different. That didn't happen here. People are going to get sick of comic book movies if they keep showing us the same movie they've already shown us twenty times before (no thanks to you, Harry Potter, for popularizing this idea). It also helps when these movies make sense.","

"X-Men: First Class","SpeedyEric","3 June 2011","Many of you have heard them all; sequels, prequels, spin-offs, remakes, and reboots, but ""X-Men: First Class"" is something different: a refresh.The best description of a refresh I can make is where the film makers take a film series, make a prequel type movie, but make a new continuity while putting in elements audiences can recognize from the original films. Producer Bryan Singer and company did a smart move with ""X-Men: First Class,"" similar but different to what Christopher Nolan did with his Batman films. Even if you haven't seen any to all of the previous films, you won't be left in the dark.Many people would say that 20th Century Fox and Marvel Comics refreshed the film series because the previous 2 films did not meet expectations (even though I like them), but I would agree that this film helped put the franchise back on course. Now I get why they meant when they said that ""The Wolverine"" won't really be a sequel to the 2009 film. I'm hoping the planned sequel in this new series will continue to give us the mutated goods.Marvel has been pretty successful with their 2011 films so far. ""Thor"" was awesome, ""X-Men: First Class"" was genius, and I'm crossing my fingers for ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" I give ""X-Men: First Class"" a solid Roman numeral 10 (if you know what I mean).","

"X-Men: First Class","paperback_wizard","9 June 2011","X-Men: First Class takes us on a strange journey. It takes us back to the land of ""might have been"".The source material has been doing this for years, of course. Alternate timelines, possible Earths, parallel universes are old hat for the X-Men. Heck, some of their members come from such times and places. But the cinematic X-Men have more or less avoided such toys.Until now. Ignoring X-3 and Origins: Wolverine (no. stop. don't. police.), the film postulates and explores missed opportunities. The tragedy of roads not taken. And it does this all without Wolverine hogging the screen! (Not to say that there just might be a cameo of some sort, bub.) By taking this unconventional approach, the franchise has not just been rejuvenated, I believe that it raises the bar for live action super-hero films in general.Magneto and Professor X. They were friends, once. But who was responsible for the creation of whom? Why are they each other's arch-foes? Let's travel back to 1962 and find out, shall we? The young, spoiled Charles Xavier we meet has lived a life of privilege and wealth. His powers are easily hidden. If anything, he's more interested in using them to chase women and score educational opportunities than change the world for the better.Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Erik is systematically traversing the globe, hunting down the men who made his childhood a living hell.Both end up on a collision course when they run afoul of the enigmatic Sebastian Shaw, the self-appointed ""Black King"" of mutantkind, who's rapidly manipulating world events to the point that the Children of the Atom just may be the only living things left.Charles' and Erik's respective arcs consume most of the film, but much focus is also had on Hank McCoy and Raven Darkholme, perhaps better known as Beast and Mystique. Neither can go out in the world without hiding what they truly are. Both long to be normal.But is their freakish appearance truly a curse? Do they need to be ""cured""? Or do they need to be proud? The tragic results of their haphazard experiments with being normal drive the points the film wishes to make home just as powerfully as Erik magnetically drives his points home in certain intense scenes.Don't be mistaken. This movie, despite the teen goofing, 60s spy film cool, and general bright production design gets very dark before the end.And it's unafraid to take this darkness to its logical conclusion.We may mourn for Beast and Mystique's relationship being starcrossed. We may sigh and shake our heads at Charles' foolishness in not understanding just the wrong things to say to a man on the brink.But the irony is, these same failures create hope, and heroism, where before was only hedonism and hidden villainy.The final truth: By having his youthful blinders ripped away, his legs crippled, and his friendship betrayed, Xavier finally understands what a terrible place the world actually is. And this gives him the fire he needs to be a shining light of goodness in it.By damning himself, Erik creates the method by which the world may ultimately be saved.This is deep, mythic story-telling here. It's the sort of fresh start Marvel's mutants needed. Here's looking to much more to follow.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)","

"X-Men: First Class","melgarcia40","5 July 2011","For all people complaining about X-Men: First Class, one must not forget that, first and foremost, it's supposed to be a summer movie, not an art-house one. As Mr McAvoy says it himself, it's not supposed to change the world, it's supposed to be fun and entertaining. And for this, X-Men First Class completely achieves its goal.I'll start with the quibbles: a few crappy lines, characters underused (Havok, Banshee, Darwin...), and some really bad CGI at times (Beast is particularly botched), and some hardcore fans will complain about (very minor) inconsistencies, etc ;but in comparison to the overall greatness of the movie, I can easily close my eyes.The directing is nice, could have been a little more audacious, but fine nonetheless. The script is good, and the setting of the action in the sixties, intertwining mutants and history during the Cold War was a fantastic idea. It gave the opportunity to the set and costume designers to have fun to recreate a James Bond-alike atmosphere, and visuals that are just delicious.The movie cleverly mimics X-Men opening scene, with the young Magneto i AUschwitz, and provides a great back story as well as some witty answers to some of the questions that arose from the first movies (it is important to note that this movies doesn't take the 3rd and 4th ones, which is great since they were both horrendous movies).Now, discussing First Class without mentioning the cast is impossible, since this is really where the movie surpasses all the previous four.Kevin Bacon as a villain is, unsurprisingly, an epic win. As usual, he is a master when it comes to portraying evil sly characters, and he was also great speaking German and Russian in this one (not pitch perfect, OF COURSE, but still, it was great to have him ACTUALLY say the lines and not being dubbed).Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult did a very good job in portraying teenage angst, insecurity and self-loath, they made their subplot really engaging.But it is obviously the two leads, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender that shine during the whole movie, they are just stellar, even if, considering the focus put on the characters, Fassbender is the one the steals most of the show. He is impeccable as Magneto, conveying his anger, sorrow, darkness and desire for revenge with sheer perfection. However, MvAvoy's part was a much subtler one, less showier, but all in nuances, and it's simply a delight to watch his dashing, rubbish-flirt, yet empathic version of the young Xavier. Therefore, when the two share the screen, it's just dynamite: their chemistry and talent irradiate and lift up the whole movie.All in all: this is not a ""great movie"" on a philosophical point of view, but it's a real great moment of entertainment supported by an outstanding cast.","

"X-Men: First Class","BA_Harrison","31 May 2014","A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch).","

It's another origin film designed to show us how the original X-Men came to be and how their founder, Charles Xavier, teamed up with Erik Lehnsherr to thwart a thermonuclear war in 1962. Along the way, we learn about the Erik's inner demons and thirst for revenge and Charles' implacable sensibility. I was interested in seeing this movie not just because I wanted to know how it all began but because I was already emotionally invested in the series, having seen four X-Men movies just in the past decade or so. That's how Hollywood is getting you nowadays, you know. Make a big movie, then make a sequel, then a prequel, then a spin-off, all designed to keep you coming back, because you know each character and recognize a bit of yourself in them as well. Here, you have the dark side (Magneto) and the light side (Professor X) - much like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, right? A classic setup.We learn that Erik, later to become Magneto, is a concentration-camp survivor who saw his mother shot to death when he could not perform his extrasensory powers to the camp commandant under duress. Now he is out to find that commander, some twenty years later. Alternatively, Charles is a ladies' man who's also exceedingly bright, working on a theses about genetics. He's a telepath and wishes to learn more about genetic mutations. His childhood friend Raven has her own mysterious powers - in her true form she is entirely blue with red hair, a striking if possibly unwelcoming figure. The unifying agent that brings Erik (Michael Fassnbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) together is one Sebastian Shaw, played by an oily Kevin Bacon. Shaw's plan is to get the US and the USSR to declare war on one another, thus wiping each other out, thus (apparently) leaving only mutants, who shall inherit the Earth. Erik wants to kill Shaw; Charles simply wants to stop him. They're consistently at odds with each other as they recruit other mutants to their cause in 1962, even as Charles helps Erik break down his own barriers to harness his powers.This gets the CIA involved (Rose Byrne), and then there's a well-done standoff at the US-USSR blockade showdown (you know, the Bay of Pigs) that tests the wills of everyone involved. I liked that; good action.A recurring theme in the X-Men movies is the battle between being who you are (i.e., a mutant) and being accepted by society (i.e., a mutant who looks like everyone else). It's not hard to draw a comparison between being a mutant and being ""different."" Do you want to just fit in, or do you want to be your own person? Raven, aka Mystique (played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't sure, either. Neither are some of the other mutants, leading to a schism that would later show up in each of the other films.First Class isn't really anything special, but it's pleasing to the eye (both in effects and in cast choice) and keeps true to its familiar characters. It fits in fairly seamlessly with the other films. It's easy to follow, of course, and the cast does a very fine job. McAvoy seems to be getting better with each role (good thing, because he was one terrible actor when he started); Fassbender, Lawrence, even January Jones (as Emma Frost) are fine as well.","

"X-Men: First Class","aircprestwork","10 June 2011","OK so first off why make this movie after they made X Men Origins Wolverine? Am I the only one that noticed Professor X walking towards the end of X Men Origins Wolverine? At the end of this film they showed him getting shot and being wheeled around in a wheel chair.I am thoroughly disappointed with Stan Lee and his decision to make this god awful film. And I am appalled at how many fans like this film. If you want to support the X Men stick to the comics at least they have an excuse for messing up the story line by adding whole series and they end up being a dream or something. Like when Wolverine dies my favorite comic by far. Look I cant tell you what to do but before you waste your money on this terrible film think about how upsetting I must be to write this review. I LOVE X Men but not the movies. If you are a true fan you will skip this film and not believe the reviews by other people who are probably getting payed to write them.","

"X-Men: First Class","Eternality","3 June 2011","The X-Men films have seen Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, 1995), the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, 2005), and even Brett Ratner (Rush Hour trilogy, 1998, 2001, 2007) taking on the directorial roles. Now put Matthew Vaughn onto that list. Fresh from the success of Kick-Ass (2010), Vaughn delivers again a blockbuster that effortlessly blends brawn and brains in a motion picture that not only entertains, but provides this summer with a title that is worth remembering. With four quite excellent features to his credit, Vaughn is now surely one of the few aces working in Hollywood.In the universe of X-Men, Vaughn's film is a prequel to all the other films, though it could also be classified as a reboot (or preboot to a reboot?) of a franchise most well-known for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. He does make a funny cameo here, but Vaughn's intention is to show that X- Men is more than just the man with metal claws. In X-Men: First Class, the popular characters are now played by a new set of actors, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender leading the way with their portrayals of Charles Xavier (or Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (or Magneto).The film shows how their characters come into light, and how they evolved into who we know they are today. A large supporting cast is headed by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who plays blue shapeshifter Mystique. Set in the early 1960s when America faced the threat of the Cuban Missile Crisis by the Soviets, First Class chronicles literally the formation of the first batch of X-Men recruits as they battle evil mutants (led by Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw) hell-bent on starting World War III.First Class takes a while to pick up as back stories are told with some detail, but when it does eventually speeds up after about thirty minutes, it becomes tremendously engaging. The film is well-edited, especially a ""recruit training"" sequence midway through that not only makes effective use of alternating split-screens that pump up the adrenaline, but provides a key emotional moment between Charles and Erik that would have far-reaching consequences. The action sequences are visually engrossing, but more importantly, they are directed with clarity so that we know what is happening.Although I feel that Vaughn's film is slightly overrated, I still think it is a pretty decent superhero film. It comes with several flaws though, most notable of which is the lack of character development and motivation of the supporting mutant characters. At a considerable ""long"" runtime of about 135 minutes, I thought there should have been ample time to address this. Another problem is that the setting is a tad too sleek and futuristic for a film set in the 1960s, such that when John F. Kennedy's black-and-white televised speech comes onto the screen, it seems jarring to the eye.While it is too much of a stretch to call First Class a great superhero film, it remains to be one of the better efforts in recent years. With Fassbender finally anchoring a lead role in a major Hollywood film, it is a good opportunity to see how talented the German-Irish actor really is. With news that there could be two sequels to this, I am all for that to happen as long as Vaughn continues to write and direct, with Singer producing.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.","

"X-Men: First Class","dfandrew","5 June 2011","Matthew Vaughn started to shine as a new star on Hollywood's dimly lit sky with Kick Ass. So I was keen on watching this new X-Men prequel, but sadly it was everything what Kick Ass was not. The worst casting ever made for a superhero movie. Imagine Mystique as a fat faced youngster, or Toad in a red costume, looking like a B movie action hero.Poorly written dialogues, 15 year old Visual Effects reminding me of a low budget movie, nonexistent action sequences and a meaningless story makes this a painful experience, you never want to experience again in your life. This is the absolute low end of the X-Men franchise.","

"X-Men: First Class","generationofswine","19 November 2016","I wasn't the biggest fan. I'm not going to say that it is the absolute greatest, or even the greatest X-Men film on earth.Honestly, if you were to ask me, they should have just killed the franchise after the travesty that was X-Men The Last Stand. And killed it in the same way that you put down a beloved yet rabid dog.But clearly they didn't and instead they gave us the oddest reboot I've ever seen.I can't really complain about this one like I do so many others. And I'm inclined to give them some very serious props for how they did it. They effectively killed absolutely every argument I have against reboots and remakes.Most of the time, with reboots and remakes, the complaint is that they are doing it because the originals were popular and made money and want to bank on that success, however they tend to redo it in a way that takes out all the charm that made the first ones so beloved, rewrite the history that fans love in such a way it's insulting, and dumb it down to appeal to the masses whilst upping the special effects in the hopes that no one notices.Usually it's all done with the explanation that ""Millennials don't understand satire and/or dark humor."" At least that is how it went with Robocop, The Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, The Amazing Spider-Man, and so on and so forth.X-Men: First Class seems to break the remake/reboot laws. Rather than re-writing the history (because the first two were really good) and destroying everything that made them so loved...they rebooted the series in the past, recast the actors, and largely left the future chronology in place.And, to reassure audiences that they weren't destroying everything they loved, they added the opening scene of the very first X-Men movie and made sure to add as much Googie architecture as possible while siting well remembered past events to assure us that, yes, what we loved is still alive and present.It shut people like me up. I can't hate on it for being a reboot because it addressed my concerns and moved on nicely.Plus the cast was great. Michael Fassbender was awesome, January Jones, Caleb Landry Jones, and Rose Byrne were outstanding and to add a cherry on top they threw in Kevin Bacon as the Big Bad.Was it because Bacon is awesome or just to give people my age a link to Jennifer Lawrence so we can still play 6 Degrees? Who know? The only problem is that, by rebooting it, they left a lot of the source history completely jumbled. The characters were largely left hanging and, though it worked for a while, the jumbled characters made the reboot franchise kind of fall apart in X-Men: Apocalypse.So 7 of 10 IMDb stars. It was a solid movie and I loved that they took the time to reboot it in a way that would kill all my instant reboot hatred...but had they written it a little tighter, it could have lasted long as a killer franchise.","

"X-Men: First Class","evanston_dad","27 May 2021","This first installment of the second ""X-Men"" trilogy is better than any of the films in the first trilogy.Michael Fassbender and James MacAvoy give much more committed performances than they need to playing younger versions of Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. We get the origin story of the first X-Men clan and learn how they broke into two factions, tidily wrapped around a revisionist version of what actually took place during the Cuban missile crisis.I don't care much for superhero movies as a rule, but on average I enjoy the X-Men movies more than any others. They're not as bloated and self-important as the Avengers or Batman series.And I really envied Michael Fassbender all of his cool leather jackets.Grade: B+","

"X-Men: First Class","drystyx","23 September 2013","As a kid, I collected some comics, mostly ADVENTURE from DC about the Legion of Super Heroes, some Superman, and from Marvel, some Fantastic Four.DC was known as better heroes, while Marvel was known as ""better characters"".In those days, those were about the only two real choices. The India Ink artistry was unbeatable. And it was the days before hacks began drawing pictures which had every hero with a 90 inch chest.So, I'm not a die-hard comic fan, but I'm not a completely free agent, either. I see this film from both sides, roughly, but mostly from the middle.This super hero film has something for everyone, I believe. It seems to stay fairly true to the comics, as I recall, certainly to the emphasis on characters.For non comic fans, it has good characters.The directing, I think, helps a lot. There really seems to be an emphasis on only two characters, with a brief attempt to show glimpses of three other characters, and a very small hint at four other characters at the very most. The others may as well be called ""Extra Number One, Two, and so forth"".Really, it is about two characters. They aren't brothers, but they behave as brothers. They are in the founding father days of a super hero group.Charles is the charismatic one, the one you would expect to be the older brother if they were brothers. He is mature and composed. He even reminds me of my older brother.Alex is the more emotional one. He has a good heart, and has good intentions, but one could say he has a ""dark side"". He isn't evil, but he isn't ""good"". There is one time when I believe he crosses the line. They are teaching a young man how to use his power of vocalization to fly, and Alex pushes him to a certain doom if he doesn't use his voice correctly. In the comic world, it's acceptable as ""sink or swim"", but in ""sink or swim"", you can always toss a line to a drowning man. I suppose here that Alex had a back up plan to use his power to somehow save the poor boy if he ""sank"".At the climax, Alex has a bout with Humanity, in which he seems to want to kill a beautiful young woman for a bullet that hits someone he cares for. He obviously never intends to really kill her, but to coax another character to stop him, as he takes his time. Many of us have been in this ""someone stop me"" situation before.What I think is best is the work done on the five characters they explore. However, I think that's laziness for a full length film to only explore five characters to this degree. Even many of the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are just fillers, basic extras.What I didn't care for were the action scenes. Again, a film has to have something for everyone. And special effects are needed for the geeks. I did like the simplicity of some of them, however. This made it more of a good balance of action and character.The weakest moments were the action moments. At one point, the villains wipe out the self important CIA team and the guards. It wasn't badly done. It was overly done, though. It seems to have been a case of ""lets give the dorks in the audience some more silly bloodthirsty killing scenes"". Fortunately, this was a small part of the film, and looked to be just an effort to appease the dorks.The direction for establishing the two central characters was outstanding, no doubt about it. We get Alex and Charles in reaction to almost everything, sometimes in unison, sometimes in differences.","

"X-Men: First Class","erick_151","30 June 2011","This movie, which is my first to review, was the biggest cinematic let of all time! We have all seen previews that make us think a movie will be something it is not, but that's not even the problem here.The problem lies in the ultimate buildup, which was quite good, with no climax. The movie pitters out midway through and never recovers, in fact it gets worse. It actually feels like they ran out of time and money and were writing the story as it goes. The confrontations are lame and forced.In summary, the first 30 minutes were an 8.8/10. After that the next 20 are about a 6.5 and the final hour is a slow decay from there down to 0 and then negative. You know it's bad when you are in California and nobody even claps at the end of the movie. The fact that this is on the top 250 movie list is insulting to all movies ever made.Final thought: All of the previous X-men movies were better than this junk. I think that people are either paid or film staff is encouraged to write positive reviews when in fact, the movie sucks. That is the only way this has a positive rating.","

"X-Men: First Class","froebusiness","4 June 2011","OK, where do I start? It's hard to imagine that there is an X-Men movie out there that is actually worse than Wolverine Origins, but it exists. Guess which one it is! X-Men: First Class starts off with some promise and then fails so miserably to deliver that I tried to get refunded on my snacks that I bought since they were ingested while I was watching this terrible excuse for a movie. I soon remembered that they were purchased at Stop and Shop, however, and was not able to do so. I don't know what the hell is going on, but for some reason critics are calling this an entertaining summer movie. I think these ""critics"" are either hammered, payed off, or inept. To me, an entertaining movie is one that leaves the viewer with some form of contentment after it ends; characters develop, plots and subplots merge, and there is a cohesive quality to the thing that makes it one whole film and not just a bunch of scenes thrown together in a somewhat logical manner. X-Men: First Class felt like the latter. The acting is sub-par, and the emotions are forced and laughable. Beast looks dumb as hell, and none of the new mutants have any pizazz. The biggest problem this movie has is its severe lack of faith in its audience. For example: when Professor X does telekinetic shenanigans, the camera shoots from his head into another person's head just so that the viewer knows that he is now in that person's head. I mean, that's movie magic people. Come on, you don't have to make a POV mind bullet to let us know what's going on, and you don't need to do a slow zoom in on a character for 3 full seconds to hint at a possible love interest (Mystique).I'm rambling here, but I don't feel like planning out an essay for this review because this movie doesn't deserve it. I'm not sure what's going on in the world because people seem to be mutually accepting of this horrible movie, but please, for the love of God, don't waste your money on this wanna be reboot; it is not worth it. However, if you want to see a bunch of semi-talented actors talk way too much, fight way too little, and clumsily make their way through a terrible re-imagining of the Cuban Missile crisis, be my guest. Hey, you're probably dumb, so you may like it.","

"X-Men: First Class","anaconda-40658","19 June 2015","X-Men: First Class (2011): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, January Jones: A superb action superhero film that addresses the origins of the X-Men characters. Director Matthew Vaughn has scored applause for his work with Stardust and Kick-Ass but this is his best work yet. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier whose younger life had it moments of fun and games but his mind reading ability led to greater expectations. Although he trains the incoming mutants, he also saves Erik's life in an attempt to kill the Nazi who killed his mother. Still, we are given insight as to why Xavier is in a wheelchair. Michael Fassbender steals the film as Erik, whom will become Magneto. His ability to attract or manipulate metal is exploited by the Nazis who shot his mother right in front of him. Years later he seeks vengeance and even Xavier's encouragement cannot prohibit the actions he will take. Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven who can render herself into the red-headed blue babe Mystique. She is uncomfortable with her appearance and seeks a cure that can allow her to appear human. Through Magneto she learns to accept herself thus leading to actions taken in the previous films. Kevin Bacon plays a suitable villain as Nazi Sebastian Shaw who executes Magneto's mother. January Jones makes a great case as Emma Frost particularly when held prisoner and able to easily carve out a circle in the glass. Years later we learn that he too is a mutant and seeks another World War until evil conquers evil. Great insightful setup with first class special effects. Score: 10 / 10","

"X-Men: First Class","rogerdarlington","23 June 2011","Having seen the previous four X-Men movies and in varying degrees enjoyed them all, I wasn't going to miss this fifth outing and by and large I was not disappointed. Like the last three episodes of ""Star Wars"" and the J J Abrams version of ""Star Trek"", this is prequel (as well as something of a reboot) which explains how familiar characters became the ones we know so well. Above all, we meet young versions of Charles Xaxier/Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and learn how the former finished up in a wheelchair, how the latter acquired his helmet, and how the two became mortal enemies.British director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn - who first burst on the scene with ""Layer Cake"" - sets most of the narrative in the early 1960s at the height of the Cold War (although I don't remember skirts being that short then), so we are presented with an alternative vision of the causation and conclusion of the Cuban missile crisis. Lots of mutant powers and special effects are on display which keeps the action moving and the entertainment levels high. Call me weird, but I'm a sucker for a blue-skinned, shape-shifting woman and Jennifer Lawrence is especially appealing as Raven/Mystique.","

"X-Men: First Class","uareariot","4 June 2011","First if you don't know jack about x-men except for the movies that came out. You might like this movie. IF you know anything about the x-men at all then you will hate this movie.First lets go over the list of the original X-Men. Professor X: Check Cyclops: nope Jean Grey: nope Beast: Check Angel: Nope Iceman: NopeSeeing how this is supposed to be the beginning to the movies it's half understandable not to have them in there as they appear later on in the movies that have already come out. However i have issues with the characters they did choose.Magneto: never was an xman yet here he is. Mystique: also never an xman and is also the mother of Nightcrawler. Banshee: Finally someone who was an x-man at some point. He was never a kid when he was with the x-men and also he is from Ireland. No accent in the movie. Beast: Ah, here we have an original x-man. But what's this his mutation is big hand feet until he tries to cure himself? That's stupid. Also this does not even follow the movies where it shows him on t.v. as a normal person not yet transformed to the blue beast we know and love. However, the actor portraying him did a good job so i accept this change for the movie, if only that was the only thing the messed up. Angel: What's this? You said Angel wasn't in the movie! HE ISN'T! Instead some girl with insect wings who shoots crappy like puff balls out of her mouth is here and she calls herself angel cuz that was her stripper name. When she called herself angel i almost walked out of the movie theater. Havok: Cyclops' little brother.... as a teenager in the early 60's which pretty much makes him old enough to be cyclops father according to the xmen movie time line. Isn't this movie supposed to preclude the previous xmen movies??? Inconsistencies with the comic is one thing but with your own movies? Come on you can do better. Professor X: didn't mind how they portrayed him. Darwin: Who? The black guy who they killed off pretty quick.Also many inconsistencies with other characters i won't go in to.All in all this movie is a spit in the face to people who are x-men fans. Good action and good special effects don't make up for that fact.","

I guess I know what I'm going to be doing in the next couple of weeks.I know that this movie is part of a bigger franchise, but this was a GREAT film on its own. Although, it will leave you wanting more. I know I'm dying for another movie. In ""X-Men: First Class"", I don't think there was ever a dull scene. I remember being interested in it all the way. I never felt my attention waver or feel a yawn coming up.Aside from the kick-ass action, this movie had its own share of good humor that doesn't fail. The audience must have laughed out loud together, at least three times. I also especially liked the emotions that were being portrayed to the audience. I could care less about Raven's love life, but I really did love the bromance that Charles and Erik shared.I don't have any other X-Men movies to compare this one to (aside from the spin-off ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), so this may either be a hit or miss with die-hard X-Men fans. But coming from an unbiased viewer, I can say that this was an excellent film. If you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for?!Viewed on: June 11, 2011","

Especially for the first hour or so of it's runtime, ""X-Men First Class"" is disjointed and everywhere - it lacks focus and drags out it's introduction too long. However, by the 2nd half, the movie has settled down and the characters have mostly come together. The strength of the cast, like the older movies, is rightfully with it's 2 leads James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, especially McAvoy who seems to faithfully represent a young and dashing Xavier. I enjoyed almost every scene with him present. Unfortunately though Kevin Bacon's antagonist seems more mischievous than truly malevolent so the movie kind of lacks an arch-villain. Anyway, there are both worse and better superhero movies out there.","

If you are thinking 'Cuban Missile Crisis', then I have your attention. However, before the world got to this predicament, we need to go back to the European theatre of World War II. In a concentration camp at Auschwitz, Occupied Poland, young Erik Lehnsherr witnesses his mother's brutal murder. During this traumatic event and fuelled by anger, Erik unleashes his secret power-much to the amazement of the perpetrator, Doctor Sebastian Shaw. Across the Atlantic, a young Charles Xavier discovers powers of his own. Before long, Xavier is a distinguished academic living with the shape-shifting Raven (who would later renegade and be called Mystique). Dedicating his life to avenging his mother's death, Erik Lehnsherr bumps into Charles Xavier, spawning an instant friendship and powerful bond. Together, and with their mutant friends, they are the CIA's last hope in averting a nuclear crisis that culminates into a spectacular face-off between American and Soviet naval forces.With all due respect, Mathew Vaughn does a phenomenal job as the director of this prequel. But fans of the Marvel comic book and the X-Men franchise will always look back to Bryan Singer for giving us the first two titles: X-Men (2000) and X2: X-Men United (2003). In fact, this installment is almost entirely the handy work of Singer, who not only co-wrote the script, but also produced the film. What he did not do was direct the movie, and that was a last moment decision due to pre-committed schedules for filming Jack the Giant Killer. So, having received the raw materials on a silver platter, all Vaughn had to do was execute it, take for take. In doing so, Vaughn has successfully re-vamped the X-Men franchise with such grandeur, a spin-off trilogy has already found its way to the drawing boards. On the whole, everything works here; from a captivating and intelligent screenplay to exceptional character development to fantastic action sequences. Whether you are a Marvel comic-book fan, X-Men movie fan or an action movie junkie, right from the start, through the 130 minutes to the end, you are sure to be entertained. Visuals are top notch, oozing CGI in many scenes. And to think, Vaughn has pulled this off without the need of those cumbersome 3D Spectacles. As a prequel, the script is pure ingenuity and takes us back to a time before Erik and Charles became the archenemies we know them to be. It is also a time when mutants are discovering and practicing their powers in secret. Aside from the mutant origins, embedded in the script is a parallel history relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis and birth of the Civil Rights Movement. The ingenuity of this is grafting history with fiction and having the audience accept its plausibility without having to state it as based on actual events. Forrest Gump was the first film to have pulled that off. First Class builds on this concept in such a clever way, that the script is studded with historical events. Another aspect of the screenplay also brings to mind a distinct James Bond theme. Maybe it is just the opinion of this reviewer, but chronologically, Bond's cinematic debut (1960s) is around the same time frame scripted for this movie. It is left to be seen if Vaughn intended for this as a mild undertone. Onto star performance, and most notable for his role as the young doctor in The last King of Scotland, James McAvoy is nothing like the Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) we have seen before. McAvoy's Xavier is drastically different, egotistical, brash, and a flirt on the loose. On the other hand, Michael Fassbender dons Sir Ian McKellan's suit as Erik Lehnsherr. Like McAvoy, he too ""paints a fresh canvas"" for the character who would go on to become the ruthless 'Magneto'. Although McAvoy and Fassbender are perfectly cast, I have to say the latter has the edge in terms of drawing you in. In doing so, he never steps on McKellan's toes, but brings out an unseen side of Erik Lehnsherr. When I mentioned James Bond earlier, I was referring to Fassbender; for some reason, his character carries a distinctive MI-6 persona. Another worthy mention should go to Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. I don't want to spoil the surprise, but Bacon's Shaw plays a key role in bringing the world to the brink of war. For the time period portrayed, Kevin Bacon is the only actor whose character dons an accent. In doing so, he almost gets his German and Russian accents to a believable level. Perhaps, Vaughn did not feel the actors needed to work on their accent and that could be why none of the other actors actually bothered with an accent suiting the setting. Aside from McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon, watch out for a plethora of good contributions from January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Zoë kravitz and loads more as newly discovered mutants along with cameos from Oliver Plat, Michael Ironside and you guessed it, Hugh Jackman. For a summer opener, X-Men: First Class does not disappoint. As a prequel, it pushes boundaries, raises the bar and broadens the scope of expanding this franchise. At a time when all we see are sequels and 3D gimmicks, this film is a surefire summer winner. If you have been following the series, you will love First Class. If you haven't, don't worry, Vaughn and Singer have successfully re-booted a dying franchise; there will be more to come.","

"X-Men: First Class","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","13 October 2017","Since its debut in 2000, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise has stood tall as one of the longest-running and generally most successful comic-to-film franchises of all time- currently boasting ten entries and with several more sequels, prequels and follow-ups looming on the horizon. But it hasn't always been a smooth ride as any fan will tell you, and the quality of the individual films has ranged from stellar to sub- par, depending on the entry and the creative team behind them. And this is best exemplified by the first five entries... with the original two films being very fun and well-constructed action- adventures, only to be followed-up by two lackluster let-downs in the form of ""The Last Stand"" and ""Origins.""But then something magical happened. After a two-picture absence, original director Bryan Singer returned to produce and co-write the fifth chapter in the ever-growing saga, with Matthew Vaughn taking the reigns and assembling a talented cast of relative newcomers. And together, these brilliantly creative minds unleashed ""X-Men: First Class"", a quasi-prequel that gives us the previously hinted-at backstory of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr, and how they became the best of friends before turning into bitter enemies. ""First Class"" is a very well assembled and often thrilling installment in the franchise that boasts strong visuals, likable characters and a surprising depth!Haunted by the death of his family and his own exploitation at a Nazi prison camp during his youth, Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) seeks to use his mutant powers of magnetism to strike back against his former tormentor- a twisted man named Sebastian Shaw. (Kevin Bacon) At the same time, young telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his shape-shifting adoptive sister Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) find themselves pulled into the world of the CIA by agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), to be used as consultants working against Shaw. Eventually, the two men meet and form a strong but begrudging friendship, putting together a team of mutants known as the ""X- Men""... But Lensherr's past agony and pain might be too much of a burden on the group, and threatens to tear them apart...The strength of the film lies in the surprisingly thoughtful and complex story that Vaughn and Singer weave, in addition the keen visual direction and highly likable cast. The story is an emotional roller-coaster, with many twists and turns to keep the audience invested all while still grounding the plot in real human relationships. Much of the film is centered on the interpersonal friendships between Erik, Charles and Raven, and they give the story a strong foundation to build upon. At its heart, ""First Class"" is a story about damaged people, and how confronting the past can either save or destroy us. Thankfully, the film avoids being bogged down in constant turmoil through clever humor brought about by the youthful energy of the team, and it strikes a fine balance. It's never too harsh to be entertaining, nor is it ever too fun to be impactful.Vaughn's brilliant eye for composition and flow never ceases to amaze, and ""First Class"" is arguably the most visually arresting film of the franchise. Vaughn's films always have a certain ""hyper-reality"" to them in terms of style and tone, and it mixes well with the series that Singer has established. There's plenty of eye-popping action and subversive thrills to be had, in addition to some subtle and very intimate scenes. It's a very well-made film. And this is only made all the better by the magnificent cast. McAvoy and Fassbender both command the screen with their performances, and are each given many a moment to shine as they go through life-changing experiences. Particularly Fassbender, who is just awe-inspiring as the man who will become Magneto. I also quite enjoyed Lawrence (in her pre-""Hunger Games"" days) and Byrne in their more supportive roles as the women in Xavier's life. Both have unique and clearly defined character arcs and add a lot to the film. Other parts played by the likes of Nicholas Hoult, Lucas Till and Caleb Landry Jones as members of the ""X-Men"" team are pitch- perfect in their casting. And of course, special commendations go to the delightful Kevin Bacon, who does a great job as a scenery- chewing baddie that you'll just love to hate. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a surprise cameo that I won't spoil, but made the entire film for me!Unfortunately, I do have to say that there are some minor problems holding the film back just shy of perfection. While the movie is well-paced and well-structured for much of its run-time, the third act is a bit messy and relies too much on generic clichés to strike home with the same impact as the rest of the film. In addition, the fact that the film is a prequel does rob a lot of the suspense as we know who will live or die and how it will all end. And finally... despite being a prequel, the film makes some rather unorthodox choices that really bugged me and contradict what came before. Yes, it was only ever meant to be a sort-of ""quasi-prequel"" that would bend or change canon and continuity when needed. But the fact it tries so hard to tie into the original trilogy while also incessantly changing key details of the previously-established backstory does genuinely annoy me as an audience member. And that's not spoiling anything, because it happens throughout the entire film.""X-Men: First Class"" might not be a perfect film, and the questionable choices it makes in regards to the canon and continuity of the franchise might alienate some hardcore series fans. But that doesn't change the fact that it boasts a remarkable cast, keen visual direction and an absolutely wonderful storyline filled to burst with emotion and pathos. It's a darned-fine film and overall a fantastic prequel to the excellent original. And I give it a very good 8 out of 10!","

"X-Men: First Class","kgprophet","3 June 2011","Comparisons can be made to Christopher Nolan's reboot of Batman, where scripting and story are refined and the genre is examined. Commonly in these types of films there are scenes of obligatory rivalry, villainy, comedy, exposition, where the dialogue is clunky and the scenario is cliché. A good example of this is the movie ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"". A good measure of a bad script is when your characters end up in a bar. The bar is the place you write your characters when you don't have any original ideas. To my memory, there are only a couple very brief scenes in a bar in XM:FC. And these sparse bar scenes are for mainly for comedic gain.This dense origin script knew what central themes it was examining before it set about to make action sequences. In other words, action scenes don't exist just for the sake of action. Characters have motivations that drive the action. The only place I might fault the storyline is trying to embed itself into the Cuban Missile Crisis. The antagonist seems to have free access to anywhere and can somehow easily convince the powers that be to instigate nuclear war. Fortunately, it doesn't matter since Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. I have never been a big fan of Kevin Bacon, but he shines in certain moments, like in ""Mystic River"" or ""Animal House"". Here he is allowed to be creepy in a very convincing way, almost making the extra aspect of possessing special powers unnecessary.Although there is much buzz about Michael Fassbinder (I raved about him myself in my review of ""Inglorious Basterds""), I was impressed by the performance of James McAvoy. He takes on the persona of a younger Sherlock Holmes. He is convincing when he puts his fingers to his temple in order to project his mind. This type of activity could easily come across as silly if not approached properly. The Magneto character without much surprise is as strong as Darth Vader in screen presence. The audience almost trembles as Magneto occupies the screen, ready to get angry at his past.One thing about this tentpole film is that it resembles the original X Men film, where emphasis was placed on character instead of action. Both these films have limited action sequences. It is actually refreshing to not require some over-the-top CGI to have a good time during the summer blockbuster season. Case in point is the noisy ""Transformers 2"", where it was just meaningless nonstop destruction. The director Matthew Vaughn infused elements of his strong film ""Kick Ass"" into XM:FC. There are scenes where teenagers work out together their issues, sometimes not knowing if their choices are the right answer. Teenage struggles work as a metaphor with having special powers. They struggle with their identity, deal with sexuality, and personal appearance. It takes very dedicated script writing to flesh out the large number of characters being juggled around in this story. Much credit must go to the screenplay writer, even though Bryan Singer wrote the story.The music by Henry Jackman is hardly original, it borrows heavily from the memorable soundtrack of ""Inception"", including the use of guitar to add texture to the pulsing strings, etc. Perhaps big summer films require the wall-to-wall bombastic music to carry the momentum, and I won't deny it works. But you sometimes wonder if this is a situation where the editor puts temp music in, in this case ""Inception"", and the director gets married to it. This diminishes the ability for the soundtrack composer to come up with something unique. It even sounds like Jackman hired Johnny Marr again to do the guitar.As for the direction, there is a lot that could have gone wrong. There is a fine balance with story pacing. You want to keep the momentum going without losing the beats necessary to establish emotion. Again, this is done to perfection in Nolan's Batman series. In XM:FC the intelligence of the main characters comes across with very competent acting. So Vaughn should be commended for getting good performances from his cast. I expect to see this film again, primarily because it has so many characters with their arcs, that I need another viewing to take it all in. All the mutants introduced in this film are given situations that are explored. The special effects are top notch, except for a couple iffy wide shots, but they are not distracting. Speaking of not distracting, I am glad the producers didn't try any hokey 3D conversion for this flick.","

"X-Men: First Class","christiangatefan","20 June 2011","It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie that much! If one looks at it as the reboot part of what it is and looks at it separate from the other movies it's even easier to love. The inconsistencies bothered me a little the first time I watched it, but only at the back of mind. By the time I got home I already wanted to see it again, and by the time I got back to the theater to watch it again this weekend I had decided to accept it fully for what it was and I enjoyed it even more. I had nothing else to do that day and watched two other movies I had never seen before but re-watching First Class was still the highlight of my day. On top of all that, through this movie I've discovered quite the love for James McAvoy. ;) I've spent all week finding and watching everything else he's ever been in! To make a long story a little less long, they would be crazy not to make a sequel to this movie!","

"X-Men: First Class","KineticSeoul","30 March 2013","When I first saw the trailer for this flick I didn't really have that good of an expectation, with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and all. But this one blew my expectation and maybe it's because Bryan Singer had a part in the story for this cool flick. Because the story is just well written and doesn't and the pacing doesn't seem to slow down but goes straight to the point. With actions sequences that blend right into the story. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender plays Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in this flick. And both those actors are freaking awesome with the roles they are given. In fact I couldn't think of any other actors to replace them. McAvoy plays the more young and like to drink, flirt and have fun while being responsible character just so darn well. Both actors are amazing in this but if I had to pick one that stood out slightly more it would have to be Michael Fassbender as Magneto. I don't know maybe I am a sucker for cool and charismatic villains. This time around Magneto it shows more of the development process of Magneto and a bit of his origin and it's just well blended into this story. He stands out way more than all the previous ""X-Men"" movies combined. Sebastian Shaw who is the main villain that is trying to start WW3 by trying to start a war between America and Russia by using his team of mutants and Shaw is played by Kevin Bacon. Let's just say Kevin Bacon is right for this role. Although Shaw isn't a very developed character, Kevin Bacon actually makes this villain somewhat memorable. So yeah, well crafted superheroes story with well developed characters or at least memorable ones with the right actors. Makes this movie a must watch for audiences that enjoy superheroes movies.8.3/10","

"X-Men: First Class","killerkitestrings","3 June 2011","I went in expecting, you know, just another X-men movie, with nothing really exceptional or different happening. What I saw was the best X-Men movie to date. All the actors played their parts well and believably, there was a lot of action in it, and it was just an all around enjoyable movie. There were very few cheesy or useless parts in it. When you watch this movie you are able to feel each character... their motivations, etc. Whether they are a ""good"" or ""bad"" character. In fact, the lines between the good and the bad are a little bit blurred in this movie, which makes it seem more realistic. Different characters have different motivations, which may be beneficial to one group while detrimental to another. Overall, it was a great movie and I hope it does well.","

"X-Men: First Class","oneguyrambling","27 December 2011","Here is why I think the X-Men films are the worst 'superhero-related franchise' in cinema: when you take away the pretty outfits and the cast of 'they're so hot right now' actors, you are left with a bunch of scrawny 20 somethings with the worst superhero *AHEM* mutant powers availableYou can teleport to nearby places and pick up things? Awesome.Oh your ability is to fly and emit high pitched screams? You must be annoying at parties.So you're essentially a giant magnet you say? Well hide the silverware.You have tiny wings and can fly and spit fireballs? Big woop. And you sound just like the screaming guy. You obviously can't go on the same teamThe obvious side-effect of this is that in most circumstances it takes an entire group of X-Men to defeat one foe, one to distract, one to disarm and one to finish the jobThis factor leads to the X-Men being like the grab bag of stuff at the yard sale, ""Look we know this stuff is pretty worthless and a waste of time by itself, but what if we sell you a whole bagful?""(But I would defend to the death Mystique's ability to be covered by little more than a coat of blue paint – even though it serves no purpose other than being able to see her cans.)A few years ago Marvel tried to spin out an origin series from X-Men one film at a time starting with Wolverine – as far as I am concerned the only remotely interesting character in the group (and this film does nothing to change that) – only they PG'd the crap out of what should be an irreverent, violent and aggressive superhero. In short they f*cked the film up.They had one shot at making the cash-in side project work. And they blew it. The XBox game rocked though...Wolverine is in X-Men First Class for less than 30 seconds and from memory he has but one line – two words in fact – the second being 'off'. This most minute of cameos provided me with the only chuckle in the film.So where does that leave X-Men First Class? Well I'll tell you what I watched; a whole array of dumb characters being 'originated' – 100 minutes in fact – before 20 minutes of bland action featuring a tug of war with nuclear missiles that would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that it was supposed to be the climax of a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that I spent money to sit through.The X-Men were not born a team of superheros, they are but genetic abnormalities who are either blessed– or cursed– with unique abilities and traits. Their own attitude to these abilities largely dictates which side they end up on.There are many mutants, and they aren't all good or bad from Day 1. Thankfully there are two Main Guys who seek out others like them and make their choices like a pick up game of basketball, only with a talent pool comprising a bunch of guys and gals that should be confined to the bench.The two 'Team Captains' are Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Charles Xavier (James McElroy). After their respective round-ups from a pool of generally one-skilled mutants the two go about training their teams. Some 'players' change sides over time, some die and some seem on the fence. Some want war, others peace. Some hate humankind, others loathe themselves.Xavier aligns himself with the forces of good by co-operating with the CIA, primarily Agent McTaggert (Rose Byrne), but even the CIA aren't united in their support of mutant-kind, and in fact some would choose genocide over unification.It's all really quite dull actually. So after a while of milling about trading examples of mutations they liven things up by giving each other nicknames and prepping spiffy uniforms, leading to the inevitable face off between sides that culminates in a series of 'oh that's how/why!' moments that dovetail into the character's of the first films.I would also question the choice to interweave a 'costumes and powers' yarn into one of the more important and harrowing tragedies in human history, that being World War 2, more specifically the Nazi genocide of the Polish and Jews, but ultimately I don't think that the core following of X-Men are history buffs at heart, so I'll let it slide Wow that could be another mediocre X-Person! Slidey. They cruise around with the unique ability to slide a bit.Awesome!In fact this film and series are eerily reminiscent of Watchmen, the ridiculously over-hyped and under-realised Zack Snyder stain on cinema that was released a couple years ago. If you re-read the above stuff and replace 'Wolverine' with 'Roarschach' you wont be too far wrong.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. In reality this is passable stuff, but don't try to sell this as blockbuster entertainment. I prefer my superheroes a little more Super.","

"X-Men: First Class","carvercape","30 September 2011","With so many characters and subjects it was probably hell for screenwriter to decide what to include in this part of X-Men. And plus to satisfy comic book fans and those who are not.In general prequels should be banned from movie making. It spoils all good things about sequels.I love X-Men 1 and 2 so having Bryan Singer involved here is only thing that made me watch this movie. But 2 things are starting to get in a way to make these movies better.First is 2nd world war and Cold war inspiration for a plot. Second is unpleasantly weak acting job by James McAvoy. Reason is for such a great mentor he is suppose to be hi is very unconvincing. Remember he is training people with amazing, often lethal powers. He lacks presence authority you can feel. In contrast to that Patric Stewart performed this part perfectly. And as main actor here that is why this movie failed despite the all good things about it. Michael Fassbender is one that did best acting here.All else is good action, effects, even screenplay is surprisingly interesting for Hollywood standards these days. And potential is there. Will see if next one is going to be better as this one feels in no way connected to sequels.","

The movie is a prequel to the other x men movie series but it's not as good as the previous ones. The story line at the beginning is confusing as it is switching from one place to an other, from past to future. However the rest of the story is getting better, and the action scenes are quite good. The performances are good too, especially Fassbender as Magnito. So 5 out of 10, because it is a nice action movie, with some funny parts, but it resembles other action movies.","

"X-Men: First Class","MLeoCasas","21 February 2013","I think the novelty of watching the birth of big names in this story has clouded a lot of peoples judgement. Big storytelling problems:1)The origins of both Magneto and Xavier were really sprinted through at the beginning of the movie. 2)The idea of Mystique being Xavier's foster sister not only isn't as interesting as her comic book origins, but also has absolutely no link in the original movie trilogy that this movie is supposed to precede.3) This being the origin of the war (a war at least as politically, militarily and motivationally complex- and longer- than the historical Cold War) between mutants and humans, there was a lot of opportunity here to showcase more than the development of the school. I get that the complexity of the comic book world can't be compacted into thee films, but while watching the original trilogy I found this fantasy world far more challenging and interesting. 4) Kind of an addition to number 3: Magneto and Xavier's brief discussions about their opposing viewpoints come off so one sided in Charles' favor. The metaphorical subject matter here is oversimplified to a point where there is very little relatability and empathy with Magneto. Even for those of us (the vast majority) who disagree with Magneto, the original films did a far better job of bringing his humanity and personal struggle to light. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the X-men canon is it's realistic reflection of morality. What is morality? Does something have to be right or wrong? Does intent or motivation factor in any way? These questions were present in the comic books and weighed in heavily in the trilogy...they get lost in a Superman-esque depiction of Xavier's moral code pitted against Shaw's psychopathic rampage here in the prequel.5) By having mutants be directly responsible for the entire Cold War (like ALL of it. Like against the will of humans...) a lot of metaphorical resonance is lost in the following story. These historical events helped shape our understanding and analysis of this fantasy world. That they have been ENTIRELY manipulated by the fantasy world itself is somewhat cheapening.6) Almsot every human was very caricatureesque. It was very cartoony and hard to take seriously.FIlmmaking Problems:1) the CGI and special effects were a little lacking for 2011. I;m not sure how this happened, this franchise seems pretty big budget.2) The screenplay was super half-**ss. This movie was scripted so that a blind man could understand every emotional detail. Even then though, the character development is shoddy and tends to leap in some way from one place to another throughout the film. The exceptions here being Magneto and Xavier....who hardly show any development at all. Their Friendship is a foot note, and their characters are at every stage fundamentally the same as the stage before. Too simple for young adult audiences.3) Supposing you're one of those people who are like ""Dude, shut up, I watched this for action, adventure, bad**ss visuals..."" i give you that that's totally part of the magic of the both comics and movies...but were you satisfied with sh*t like banshees lame flight scenes? Or Magento's underwhelming displays of power? Or how about Havok's greatest display of strength being his cutting a statue in half? The one scene with any good edge of your seat action was when Shaw raids the military base. Period.4) The villains, without exception, were hard to watch because they were all acted poorly and given very little exposure.Sidenotes:-The wolverine cameo was stupid and gimmicky.-The beach scene was anticlimactic.Magneto blaming Moira for Charles' injury lasted about 30 seconds and either needed to be elaborated upon or cut entirely.Charles telling Raven to go with Eric was indefensibly stupid, uncharacteristic and again, in no way relevant to the story of the trilogy.-Who chose the lineup of mutants here? Just super underwhelming. And none of them do anything too cool with their powers. It was like watching a b-string circus. I'll admit I'm kind of excited see if Mystique and Azazel's affair and Nightcrawler are incorporated in the future though.Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and James McAvoy gave the only good performances in this movie, and even then (with he exception of McAvoy, who seems to genuinely be trying to squeeze water from a stone here) the performances are brought down by the story, screenplay and generally poor filmmaking.This is a really successful franchise...like really very successful. Who OKed this? How many people were down, read/watched/reviewed this before it's release and were like ""looks good to me."" Seriously. This movie didn't hold up to precedent, and without the novelty, if the comic books and trilogy hadn't been around, it would have flopped very very hard.","

"X-Men: First Class","MihaiSorinToma","4 January 2018","In a world where mutants lived camouflaged among humans, Charles Xavier, a mutant who can read minds, starts recruiting in preparation for an imminent battle with a malicious group who is determined to start World War 3. This movie presents the beginnings of the X-Men, how each of them began to use their powers, their struggle to accommodate with humans and the battle that separates them into two distant factions.It manages to tell its story in an entertaining and thrilling way alongside all the awesomeness generated by the mutants and their powers. It's unexpectedly captivating and the fact that it leaves almost no question unanswered regarding the origins of the mutants makes it even more interesting. I have to admit that one or two aspects of the ""young ones"" are a bit exaggerated and awkward but that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. It was a pleasant surprise from this franchise and I can only hope they will maintain this level in the upcoming titles.","

"X-Men: First Class","Maleplatypus","18 July 2011","When I don't press FFD button while watching, the movie must be good. When I don't pause the movie while watching, for whatever reason, it must be very good. When I recommend it, it must be excellent. This one I recommend. Perfect casting, music, camera, editing, directing, acting, you name it. It is not simple to ""swim"" within the boundaries of a (so to speak) fairy tale (or fiction) and yet remain entertaining and not insulting viewers' intelligence. This movie has it all worth watching more than once. Every bit of it radiates the enthusiasm of the people involved. It provokes emotions. Definitely stands out in ordinary movie industry production. Take your time and watch it. Spend some quality time with yourself/friends. And, of course, have fun as I did.","

"X-Men: First Class","nairtejas","27 October 2013","Prequels always do the wonder and do not have the risks of jinxing. So much that this film marks a reboot rather than the story-telling.The cast is superb, though some characters failed to impress. Their performances are good, too. But, the CGI & VFX & the story are what will send your heart racing because everything gels if you've watched the sequel trilogy. One thing still baffles me about Prof. X, maybe they'l clarify it in 2014.But, the amount of eagerness that got occupied in my heart during the watch can hardly tell the degree of entertainment it delivered. Hence, with a wonderful music backing a strong screenplay, this is a sure 8.1/10.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended for both followers & newbies.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"X-Men: First Class","siderite","21 July 2011","Someone had the idea to cash in the X-Men concept in a series of movies and they did try to follow the comic, adding as much special effects as was computery possible. However, it all backfired when the dated (and often conflicting) general ideas in the graphic novel made the movies little more than casual entertainment. So they did the ""reinventing"" trick. Find some smart people and rewrite stuff so that it matches with the past, but removing the ridiculous part. Kind of like changing the Klingons in StarTrek, another perpetually reinvented franchise.The amazing surprise is that they did a good job. The plot is complex, the characters well defined and in the end you are left wanting more, while understanding why everything happened the way it did. A cast of good (but not unnecessarily shiny) actors ranging from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender to Kevin Bacon and Michael Ironside complemented the well written plot. I even liked the little Wolverine cameo scene, which was funny and subtle, something rarely seen in American movies.Bottom line: I really want more! If they keep up the good work this could really mean a movie renaissance of the X-men idea. Not flashy arrogant super power stars, but people with feelings and complex history behind them and normal except the mutation that is both blessing and curse. In spirit, so much closer to the comic than the other dreadful attempts at putting it in movie form.","

"X-Men: First Class","Coneydogg","4 June 2011","This second go around for the X-Men is as good as the first if not better. I seriously hope this is the start of another trilogy. Sure, they have a lot to live up to but this film seems more sophisticated and has a better story than the very first X-Men movie, which was primarily about setting up this universe. Here, the characters previously introduced are fleshed out in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The cast-selection is perfect, even in the established roles. I had my doubts whether anyone could fill Patrick Stewart's or Ian Mckellen's shoes but that really wasn't the case. These actors just took the younger roles and played it perfectly. I loved the action and the heart of this film and, again, it all perfectly blends with what's come before without relying on it at all. This stuff stands on its own and stands tall.I remember back in May, my friend and I walked out of the theatre after seeing Thor smiling. We loved that film and anointed it the best of the summer. Well, maybe we were a bit hasty in our judgment. I knew this X-Men movie would be better than X3, but I wasn't expecting to walk in and see a classic and a genre-defining movie. Thor still rates right at the top of the summer but right now, X-Men First Class is the best movie of the year. Bring on the sequels!","

"X-Men: First Class","silverfox86","3 June 2011","I thought that the movie was great. Other then the scene where shaw kills magneto's mother, the beginning of the movie starts off a little slow but once Moria mets Xavier, the story starts to pick up. James McAvoy was an awesome Charles Xavier. You see him go from young party guy to a more distinguished man. I wish at the end of the movie they would have explained why he is bald but hopefully we will find out in the sequel. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is prefect. By far the best performance in this film is Fassbender. He is a huge star in the making. I think the movie did a good job with their friendship and showing at the end that they respect each other but they disagree and must go there separate ways. Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw was surprising very good and a great villain. The scenes on the beach are awesome. I was very happy with the movie overall and I am so excited for a sequel. Hopefully they will add Cyclops or Gambit, or at least someone more well known then Banshee or Havok. Matthew Vaughn did a great job. He should direct every X-Men movie for now on. I thought it was one of the best superhero movies that I have seen.","

"X-Men: First Class","t_atzmueller","27 March 2012","The first ""X-Men"" movie from 1999 was one of the few comic-book adaptations that actually worked! The second part, almost as expected, was ""so-so"" and the third, well, best not to loose too many words. Then came the abysmal ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", and pretty much all hope for a dignified continuation of the series was lost. Plus, the current season offered a whole squad of mediocre comic book adaptations; ""Captain America"", ""Thor"", ""The Avengers"", just to name a few of the heart- and soulless CGI-abominations that have come to your cinema these days.So, expectations for a re-boot of ""X-Men"" (which, despite all nods to the original series, it is) weren't all too high; didn't even bother watching it in cinema – which turned out to be a mistake.""X-Men Origins: First Class"" is the first film, that comes anywhere close to the charm of the original. The fan was generally worried about not seeing any of the original characters played, say, by Patrick Steward or Ian McKellan – they need not worry: the chemistry (the magical word in ""X-Men"" 1999) between the cast is first-rate. I didn't like James McAvoy that much in ""The Last King of Scotland"" and hadn't seen much of Michael Fassbender, other than his small role in ""Inglorious Basterds"" – here, as the future Dr. X and Magneto, they're both excellent. And Dr. X isn't even bald! Word had spread among geeks that there would be a guest-appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and the word was right. We might come to expect pretentious, predictable cameos like, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appearing in ""The Expendables"". Rather, Jackman and Romijn appearances combined, last less than 10 seconds, yet are so well placed and timed; it almost made this fan applaud. Chemistry and timing; the director succeeded, where the last three parts have failed.The character of Azazel, the red-skinned demon mutant, is one of the let-downs of the movie. First of all, (considering that Alan Cumming played an excellent Nightcrawler in ""X-Men 2""), there really was no need to create a duplicate in red. Sure, Azazel is Nightcrawlers biological father in the comics, giving rise to potential future story lines, but the supernatural and mutant powers didn't mix so well in on paper, and they do less so-so film.Special praise would go to Kevin Bacon: his arrogant, self-sure Sebastian Shaw character (who, in the comics is often one of the blander villains), works perfect as antagonist of this film – and his demise is actually rather brutal and memorable. Bravo (again, said in a geekish tone – but, as in everything, the geek is capable of finding some faults: Bacons German accent is atrocious).There was even an unexpected bonus: waiting for the extra-scene, that was not to come, I sat through the credits and noticed that the final track is actually quiet an ear-catcher. To my horror, I had to realize that this was a ""Take That"" song – pardon me, it's a Metalhead speaking, who's last words will be ""Black Sabbath Rules"". But yes, the song fit like the proverbial ""butt on the bucket"".So, despite knowing that the future ""X-Men Origins II – Rise of the X-Men"" (or whatever they'll call it), won't live up to ""X-Men Origin: First Class"", I'll probably march into the cinema, hand over my eight bucks and go watch it. Damn you, Hollywood, you've conned this sucker again! 8 out of 10","

"X-Men: First Class","mithilbhoras-103-581296","28 October 2011","I never was much interested in comic book action movies. But Chris Nolan got my attention in the Batman series. Then Mathew Vaughn's Kick-ass became one of my favorites. Then when I heard he was making a x-men prequel, I decided to see the trilogy. And thank god I did... This movie was one of the most stylish, brilliant and cool movie in years. But otherwise, the experience of it was remarkable. Charles Xavier and Erik's character were very well performed(they are my favorite in the entire series). The movie surprisingly is less in action and more in drama and that makes it more powerful. Bryan Singer did a good job on the story. But it somehow doesn't do justice to the original trilogy. But then, who cares? This movie begs to be enjoyed in the highest quality. The music is rocking and has a great feeling about it. The cinematography makes it more clean and sharp. The whole Production is good. Action movies on comics have always been fair. But I think the era is changing now.... X-men is the best comic according to me because it is metaphorically similar to the ""special ones"" in our own human society. And battles did take place for the same reason in reality. X-men First Class depicts this beautifully through the friendship of two mutants who eventually end up as foes. Truly First Class... 9/10 (I took off one star point just because the story has some loop-holes. No spoiler!)","

It gives you the back story of the duo and shows how the X-men came to be! The good stuff: James and Michael do a fantastic job portraying the young Prof X and Magneto. The action sequences are fantastic. The special effects are fantastic. The story is fantastic. It explains how some of the X-men from the other films came to be and answers other questions like why is Prof X in a wheelchair. A great performance from Kevin Bacon and the entire cast!

"X-Men: First Class","evan_harvey","7 June 2011","The latest X-Men movie is okay. The best one is still X-Men 2. #1 was good. #3 sucked. Origins: Wolverine was disappointing, and the latest effort is not too bad. Unfortunately, though, there's nothing really good about it either.Other than charting the rise of Professor X and Magneto, it's all a bit dull, I found. It lacks drive and at times feels more like a rehash of concepts from the first 3 in the series, rather than the exploration of something new.It takes place during the Cold War, which is because it's really the last event after World War 2 that the US wasn't facing unpopular coverage over. Unfortunately, the Cold War, and specifically the Cuban Missle Crisis doesn't really resonate that much anymore.The story was written partly by Bryan Singer (who worked on the first 2 X-Men films before Brett Ratner insulted us with X-Men 3), and it's a little out of sync with both X-Men 3 and Wolverine, not that it matters too much however.The cast all do okay. I was afraid that it was going to descend into a teen flick with all the mutant kiddies, but it managed to steer away from that.Kevin Bacon stars as the antagonist, but he's largely useless (apart from inexplicably going from a German accent to an American accent) and somehow becoming a super-mutant.Overall the script was okay, but lacked a certain something. It's hard to put my finger on it, but it just seemed a bit light and a bit shallow. The mutant powers were all a bit weak on the goodies' side, whilst the baddies had the cool stuff.Overall, 7 out of 10.","

"X-Men: First Class","xamtaro","2 June 2011","X-citing, X-travagent and X-tremely entertaining, X-men First Class explodes into theaters with a coming of age tale that digs deeper than your usual special effects laden blockbuster. Here is a rare creature, a prequel that may easily be one of the few that can hold their own against their original films. If the insipid X-men Origins Wolverine left a bad taste in the mouth, X-men First Class returns to the roots of what made the original X-men such a hit in the comic book world. Roaring adventure tales with lovable characters; epic in scope yet filled with heart and spirit.One complaint against the otherwise excellent X-Men films by Bryan Singer was that it was less of an ""X-men"" film and more like a Wolverine film guest starring the X-men. First Class corrects that mistake and delivers a true ensemble film that gives ample development to all its main characters. Ironic that for the film which perfectly captures the team dynamic and chemistry of ""X-men"", it is not based on any one particular X-men comic title, not even the similarly named series ""X-men: First Class""(the comic).The movie works purely as a prequel set largely during the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. Before becoming Magneto the master of magnetism, Erik Lensherr was a bitter mutant seeking vengeance against the Nazi officer, Sebastian Shaw, who tortured him and killed his mother. Before he was professor X, telepathic Charles Xavier was a suave, wavy haired University graduate who, along with his adopted shape shifting sister, Raven, are put to work by the CIA to track down the infamous leader of the Hellfire club who so happens to be the Sebastian Shaw Erik is seeking. A fateful turn of events brings these unlikely individuals together and the discovery of Shaw's plans of nuclear war inspires the establishment of a team of mutant agents to end this crisis. Together, Xavier, Erik and Raven recruit a team of young adult mutants, each with their own powers, quirks and insecurities about their place in the world.As the film moves along its brisk pace, the motivations, perspectives and unique personalities of each character are adequately fleshed out within a limited period of time. Themes of racism, alienation, extremist idealism and discovering one's calling in life, all themes inherent in the X-men comics and past movies, are explored. Tragic turn of events inevitably lead to questioning of one's allegiance and most courses of action that the characters take come very naturally, their reasons implied through dialogue and subtle cues . Audiences more used to explicit exposition and explanation for characters' motivations might feel that some of the characters' actions made little sense. Rest assured, it is all implied within the narrative but never feel at the forefront due to the film's pace.Already at a whopping 131 minutes, X-men First Class does feel rushed only because it tries too hard to develop all the main characters. While each of them do undergo significant changes and growth by the end, this comes at the price of underdeveloped villains and a story that hops all over the world with no sense of a time frame; one moment, This leads to some avoidable plot holes especially in the middle and later parts of the film. And on the subject of time, this movie is meant to be set in the 1960s. However, aside from some old computers and archival footage of President Kennedy, nothing else feels like it fit in that era. The look of the various locales, the way the characters speak, even the clothing have an obvious 2000s feel.Not that there is anything wrong with how the characters speak. The writers bring a snappy rhythm and youthful beat to the dialogue, enhanced many fold by the excellent performances and impeccable chemistry of the actors. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender who play Charles and Erik respectively manage to channel the nuances of the roles previously played Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. As a result, their characters feel familiar for the long time fans yet fresh to newcomers to the franchise. The only black mark on the script is the mandatory romantic subplot involving Raven, Hank and Erik which felt like it was put in there as an afterthought.After two disappointing X-men movies, ""evolution leaps forward"". Compared to the other X-men films, X-men First Class out shines both X-men 3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine. One could regard this movie as almost on par with the first, delivering pure entertainment in the action but never forgetting its heart in the characters. It is easily accessible to new audiences while those who have watched the previous X-men movies will thrill at the many connections and references made. With a sequel already being planned, the X-men movie franchise is finally getting the jump start it needs.http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/","

"X-Men: First Class","troy-manatunga","11 June 2011","Good action sequences and irregular spikes in character development are always better than not having any. I would not wish to mislead the reader right from the start, since ""X Men: First Class"" is one of those movies that many of us impatiently looked forward to this summer. In a nutshell ""X Men: First Class"" although is not the best in the franchise it does at times manage to reach out and speak to the audience. This movie has been the best in the franchise to some and this movie is also being considered a top notch CGI treat and an astonishing action flick. However to me it threw out mixed signals, although I would watch it again on DVD someday, I would like to make my insight very clear on this. ""X Men: First Class"" is highly overrated and feeble in its plot with lesser focus on character growth which in a prequel is VITAL I think. This is how I prepared myself to watch the supposedly massively entertaining summer blockbuster ""X Men: First Class"". I took the time to watch the entire X men Quadrilogy once again; refreshed my memory and then I made my way to the theatre. I was fresh in my mind and had all the X men facts lined up quite neatly. Is it only me or did anyone else notice the fact that in ""X Men: The Last Stand"" Professor X and Magneto were still close friends and Professor X was still walking when they went to pay a visit to young Jean. Not to mention he was pretty much bald as well at that point of time and also hands out a leaflet of his Xavier's School for the gifted to Jeans parents. Seems like writers didn't want to be very precise on the facts since Professor X is on his cool X Men wheel chair and he has a lovely growth of hair in the greatest prequel said to have been made! Mismatch? Why? This was the cherry on the icing for me to be very stern on my view that ""X Men: First Class"" failed me. Sluggish and slow for over 40 minutes and very slow character developments is one the factors that disheartened me and affected my viewing pleasure. Seem like the great enemies Magneto and Professor X decided to go their own ways for a reason so trivial that it made me laugh in the end. They almost could have wrapped it up as a great movie if all the loose ends would have been given more thought. Speaking on the areas of CGI seems a bit tricky, however I need to be honest and say that a greater part of the movie the CGI was well at average if not even better. A majority of the CGI was very intelligently thought through with the exception of one. The missiles on the beach looked a bit like it came out of a Nintendo 64! Sadly this is all I can share without spoiling it for you readers in case you have not watched the movie yet. If you ever do watch it, pay very close attention to the missiles on the beach and you will see what I mean. At the risk of the cliché every cloud has its silver lining! In a very bland environment, the bond between Professor X and Magneto (Erik) at the soon to be Xavier's school for the gifted reached out to me and I actually felt a strong connection between the two mutants and was most welcomed beautiful experience. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender plays it exceptionally well and really works some magic with their characters despite the fact of the weakly written script that gave them only that much to work on. Kevin Bacon was the ideal villain and he fitted Sebastian Shaw like the perfect leather glove. With such great casting and with some convincing acting its shocking how Matthew Vaughn could not pull this movie to shore. Should one watch it should one not? Since its X MEN I think one should. However I am glad I never purchased a ticket to watch this, I walked in with a free movie pass, so I feel my money was saved! To our intelligent and passionate movie lovers, this one is entirely over to you!","

"X-Men: First Class","BenceHartl","4 September 2011","Everything went wrong with the X-men movies when Bryan Singer decided to stop directing them. The first X-men film was an amazing picture with excellent cast and superb directing despite the lower budget. X2 was even better, larger, deeper than the first one. Then Brett Ratner and the producers managed to screw a great story with just simply wrong timing and cutting and unnecessary rewritings of the script. I don't even mention Wolverine which was a mediocre Hollywood trash on the level of Daredevil or Elektra.The story here in X-men - First Class is not bad, you can feel that Bryan Singer had some ideas during the writing session. But the final result is very, very disappointing. We have a lot of interesting characters here but no time for a reasonable dialog between them. The young versions of our admired heroes are saying the silliest lines - repeatedly! - to each other with harsh, annoying, nonstop score in the background. The viewer has the feeling that it's just a two our long trailer of some summer blockbuster-wannabe - and I know it was meant to be a summer blockbuster but after the first two episodes I was expecting much-much more from this franchise.Matthew Vaughn is an otherwise extremely talented director, I love all his previous movies but this is lack of any of his virtues. Maybe the ironic view or the humor is missing here which he had before in Stardust or Kick/Ass. X-men is probably not that franchise where you can turn things to a grotesque, sarcastic direction, Vaughn tries it a couple of times and he usually fails. (There are some scenes that are supposed to be funny.) Okay, and what about being cool? Layer Cake is one of the coolest movies ever made, but that also can be said about X-men and X2. Well, this movie is unfortunately not cool at all. Maybe it tries too hard to be cool but this huge effort to overdo everything makes it undignified and embarrassing.The cast is superb though. It's nice to see that the producers had some money for the actors too not just for the action sequences. James McAvoy is great as always, Michael Fassbender is a perfect young Magneto, he just has some stupid lines and he can't do anything with them. But we have here the amazing Kevin Bacon, the very talented Jennifer Lawrence (watch Winter's Bone instead of this film), the coolest chick of the picture: January Jones (in a very silly costume - most of the costumes were probably borrowed from the wardrobe of Kick/Ass) and such great actors as Michael Ironside for insignificant tiny roles. Sadly, the script doesn't make an opportunity for any of these great actors to do something memorable.Well, at least the action sequences are pretty spectacular. However, there's nothing you haven't seen before in the earlier movies - or in somewhere else.Briefly: X-men - First Class is a mediocre Hollywood trash with wasted talents, ruined ideas and nice action sequences. Enjoy if you can.","

"X-Men: First Class","EthanBJones_03","11 April 2017","​Plot Overview: As America and the USSR tred closer to thermonuclear war, a mutant by the name of Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon) attempts to ensure the war via missiles in Cuba. It's up to holocaust survivor, Eric Lensher(Michael Fassbender) and genius Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) to build a team of mutants and save humanity.Directed by Matthew VaughnStarring James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Kevin Bacon# NO SPOILERS!Overall: A prequel that is amazing, doesn't suck and restarted a nearly dead franchise? This movie made that dream possible and that is all down to Matthew Vaughn's directing skills and the acting capabilities of McAvoy and Fassbender.The type of people who like this movie are people who enjoyed the original two X-Men movies and like fun, fast paced action.Would Recommend# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!James McAvoy was excellent as Charles Xavier as was Michael Fassbender as Eric Lensher. I love the insight into Eric's past and how his tragic upbringing factors into the movie as a whole. Jennifer Lawrence was, in my opinion, a much better Mystique than Rebecca Romjin. Rose Bryne's performance was alright but I don't understand why she was needed in the movie. January Jones was an alright Emma Frost. Nicholas Hoult was a much better Hank McCoy and Beast compared to Kelsey Grammar. Sebastian Shaw was a very weak villain and Kevin Bacon's performance didn't convince me either.It was a nice and interesting origin story that neatly introduces the past of the X-Men and restarted the entire franchise. An impeccable ending that perfectly finished the film. The way it explores Eric's tragic past and uses that in the story was very interesting. I also adored the setting of the Cuban Missile Crisis and though it was a genius pull for the movie. It doesn't focus on Wolverine which was a pretty prominent flaw for the original trilogy, to me.The cinematography was nice and decent. It worked well.The effects were awesome and badass and really benefited the movie. Some of them also genuinely looked realistic and plausible. The action scenes in this movie were awesome and were just really enjoyable. There was both appropriate humour/foreshadowing and appropriate dramatic scenes that worked really well. This movie also introduces a whole host of new and interesting characters while still remaining a key few and uses them in a juggling act so complex but does it so well.The music was pretty decent. The best moment in this movie was easily the Wolerine cameo that was just a symbol of perfection.Personally, I loved this movie and think it is an origin story done right.8/10","

"X-Men: First Class","emutronix","11 August 2011","Before i saw this movie i rated Wolverine Origins the worst adaptation ever, but now i must say this is even worst!!!For a movie and forgetting the X-men official universe, its actually a pretty good movie, but as an adaptation its terrible...I'm a big fan of this kind of movies so i must say it's not bad in it's category. It as good plot, good actors and decent special effects. But i'm a bigger X-men fan... And i am very disappointed with the way the writers converted my favorite Marvel franchise to the big screen.If you are a X-men fan then i guess you will be as disappointed as me when you see this movie, whoever if you are not a X-men fan or comic book reader and this type of movies is your thing then i think you myth enjoy it and like it.","

"X-Men: First Class","whataker","18 July 2012","Well I'm a fan of X-Men - not in a fanboy way - I've read a few comics, grew up watching their cartoons - so generally am quite forgiving even of the more mediocre x-men films. This film however for me just dropped the ball. The guy playing Xavier was simply awful, not only a bad actor but unpleasantly smug too - a smugness that seeped into the tone of the whole film. Also the film felt strangely low budget and well... grey.. lacking panache.Overall I found it baffling how an X-men film could be so dreary and left me wondering why the film was even made as it seemed to lack any passion or creativity.","

"X-Men: First Class","Keyan-the-Eagle144","29 July 2018","After the debacle that was The Last Stand, I was leery of X-Men films. When I heard there were going to be more, my attention was held. We'd have new cast members and new villains, plus an origin story of Professor X and Magneto. We got James McAvoy of SciFi's Children of Dune and Kevin Bacon (who starred in Tremors and Animal House) and we got an era during the Cold War a decade after the second World War. I don't remember too much of First Class, but it was very entertaining. If you wanted more X-Men but were turned off by The Last Stand, this should be your priority. This movie works as a prequel. And it doesn't suck.","

"X-Men: First Class","tankace","15 June 2016","X-men First Class came out in 2011 and it is a reboot-prequel of the original trilogy who end with the Last Stand ( what a dumb movie) and it is awesome . Until I see X-men Apocalypse I will review the installments of this franchise which with this flick came back from the dead!! To the film itself ,is set in the sixties during the Cuban Missile Crisis and we meet the younger versions of Magneto, Professor X, Mystique and Beast, who try to stop the World War III for happening. To the cast everyone plays his or her role close to excellent with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender stealing the show.What I liked was that they both want the best for their mutant brothers and sisters but the means they prefer are as far as it get ,dispute that their friendship is totally real. Bonus fact Fassbender is the better Magneto than Mackellen and I stand to my view!! To the rest Jennifer Lawrence ,before becoming Katniss ,plays Mystique and she rocks, you totally believe that she wants nothing more than to fill part of a bigger team ,the same goes for the Beast, who is my favorite character of the X-men since I can remember myself and his depiction here redeemed the character from his first appearance in the Last Stand. The only character that felt a little shallow were the team of the villain of the story, apart from Kevin Bacon who was the epitome of an arrogant, mad scientist,but it was not so bad to break the movie.Now to the theme, because every superhero no matter who great ,over the top or Strange( for Dr Strange :)) he or she is has a theme ,which is the fuel for the actions that they do. Spiderman's is responsibility ,Batman's is justice, Punisher's is vengeance and so on. To the X-men the theme is as I previously wrote to find somewhere to belong and face the racism of the rest of the society because of their powers. And here we get it and then some ,with Magneto been the Malcom X and Professor been the Martin Luther King of this universe and in the end their view are both right!! ( Although personally team Magneto) In summary the movie is great and its only weaknesses , which to find you must nit pick, it is the the villains ,except from the leader and their plan .But its strong parts is the rest characters , the action, the setting ( in 1963 the first X-men comic was published so they literally return back to the basic) and the alternate history from our own ,which the creators of the movie made. I like it due to it answer indirectly a big question ,what would the world today be like if heroes like that of the myths walk among us!!A thing of Beauty!! You should definitely see it if you have not already.","

"X-Men: First Class","tl12","12 September 2011","Was WWII started by Canada? It probably was in this What?-Men series. Many old graphic novels have gone through a ""reboot"" but none that I know of totally abandoned the original story with such absolute disrespect.This a a total abandonment of the original X-Men story/ies. At the least it could have been an alternate world X-Men story. Unfortunately it seems Marvel has failed to see the wisdom in the DC Batman reboot that still kept the roots of the original story and updated it with two of the best graphic novel movie adaptations that have been made.I do not care about the people in this story because I do not know them and there is not enough background to get me to care about these unknown or totally changed characters. Does this make me a HATER as earlier posters have said. NO, rather it makes me a lover of fully fleshed out characters. If you want to make a story about brand new characters then don't try to sucker a loyal audience that knows the X-Men and their history and try to pawn it off as the ""ORIGINAL"" X-men. We have more intelligence than that and more love for the real story.By the way did you know that Superman originally came from Scranton, PA and Spiderman got his ability because he sat in some spider droppings? Watch for these movies next in the Orwellian world that rewrites the history of all things.","

"X-Men: First Class","mattmaclean","13 August 2011","I have to say I made this account simply for reviewing this tile. I was shock to see that it had an 8/10 on this site. I can certainly see how the movie could be entertaining, but good? No. For me this ruined much of the mystery of Charles and Erik's relationship.So these two 'friends' only knew each other for a couple days/weeks before they became enemies. I got the impression their relationship was much more extensive than this.I enjoyed all the other x-men movies, the first being my favourite. I am not a huge x-men fan, I really only know the movies so I have no idea if they match up with the original works, but I can say for certain that first class doesn't match up with the first three films at all. This thing had more gaping plot holes then a shotgun wound. And if it wasn't supposed to connected to the other films why was there a Wolverine cameo?The breakdown:Acting: Decent, but nothing spectacular. I found the scenes where Charles helps the other mutants with training extremely hard to stomach.Plot: The idea of this was something I had interest in. Seeing how it began, but after seeing the first preview I was thinking it looked very bad. But I was disappointed because it turned out to be much worse. It seems like a bad attempt to quickly show the history between Erik and Charles. And again, so many plot holes with regard to the other films.CGI/special effects: I thought they were done well. Though beasts face was horrible, I love the way they did it in last stand.Action: I felt myself yawning during these parts. I didn't really enjoy a single action sequence in the whole film.Casting: Not bad actors, but I felt no one was really into it.Final thoughts: Basically watching this movie and then thinking about it made me a little angry. If you like superhero movie you'll probably see this no matter what I say, I suppose I would too.","

"X-Men: First Class","pod-927-362493","5 June 2011","Firstly, this was the first X Men film I have seen. And boy, after watching it in the cinema, it sure did deliver beyond expectations. For some reason which I'm still not certain of, the X Men films never really did attract me, maybe because I thought it would just fall into the stereotype of traditional over rated Marvel releases that have you falling asleep because you feel like your watching the film for the sake of it. Back to the point, this film had me walking out of that cinema with a smile on my face so wide, the grand canyon would be put to shame. This wasn't a smile of ""oh that really entertained me"", no, because films are not for entertaining, but for gripping you and pulling you into that screen. This sure did that. Box ticked for sure. Lets start with the cast, and wow, just brilliant. The relationship between each and every single member of the cast was just astonishing. This was because you could feel it, not just see it. I loved James McAvoy's performance of a dry sense of reserved humour backed up with that Oxford knowledge, which I believe gave him the edge over Michael Fassbender, who I must say should not be left in the dark. The sense of emotion was beaming from Magneto, maybe he does actually have magnetic powers, because he sure did attract me to his sense of feeling for those whose his character had lost. But of course, me being me, I do like a villain! Therefore I say, take a bow Kevin Bacon. For me, Kevin was my personal favourite from the film. His edge of darkness and sly character really carried a strong performance throughout. He really took centre stage with this and did not hold back on anything, his movement, voice and charisma just had me grinning all the way. He had everything a marvel bad guy should have. An evil background, arrogance, slyness, and of course, a really cool costume. Well, a really cool helmet which was taken from the latest NASA space shuttle. Next, what else gripped me from this film was of course, the Directing of the cast. For this, I take my hat off to Matthew Vaughn. And from some reliable sources, ""he should have done the others"". And after seeing First Class, you can clearly see why. As the saying goes, he did exactly what it says on the tin, he did a first class job! This was because he did not play it out like the good guy catching the bad guy, he added levels which had the mind ticking over constantly. I found myself asking myself, what happens next, oh my gosh where will it go now, and stating I was not expecting that. And that is what a brilliant director does, he reaches out beyond that fourth wall and draws in the audience, making them feel a part of the story, getting them to look in all directions, keeping them guessing until that final scene.Overall, I'm not a film critic. All of the above probably has no sense in it. I'm just trying to give an honest cinema going opinion of what I saw. And what I did see, was simply, amazing. It blew beyond all expectations, had me transfixed for the entire journey, had me smiling, wondering and enjoying. The choice of cast, which was strengthened by the bond of the young uniting to take down evil, lead with expert knowledge, took this film to the max. The screenplay with the thrilling and jaw dropping battle scenes in comparison to the one on one scenes which were intense yet heart felt had me feeling like this was worth the money. For a first time X Men viewer, this is a feature that is worthy of any audience and does everyone who took part proud, it is an outstanding achievement in the industry of film. Just brilliant.","

"X-Men: First Class","redbud211","22 November 2011","Totally agree with the review by wally_greeneyes_dee (posted in June). This movie did not stay true to any of the characters of X-Men at all, in any fashion.If you go into the movie knowing anything about the X-Men and their relationships going forward, nothing in this movie parallels. Professor Xavier is not as controlled and stoic, but more of a loose cannon. None of the characters act in any resemblance to their comic-book persona.The dialogue is cheesy (although we can allow for some of that, being based on comic characters). It is hard to explain in detail everything that is exactly off about this movie, but overall it is just wrong in so many ways that at the end you feel very let down.","

"X-Men: First Class","GeorgeRoots","16 November 2013","Now this is where the ""X-Men"" franchise, totally begins to redeem itself. After ""The Last Stand"" (2006) and ""Wolverine: Origins"" (2009) had disappointed me, I was so happy as well as confused to hear about the beginning of a new ""X-Men"" trilogy. But then upon hearing it was going to be based on one of the more recent mini-series ""First Class"", hype necessarily followed. When also considering the abundance of super-hero movies coming out this year, ""X-Men: First Class"" was the only one I was really looking forward too.Though people seemed frustrated due to the fact that a majority of recognisable characters were missing from this story, I was really happy for this movies opportunity to feature all these virtually unknown characters who are brilliant and played by confident, unknown actors.The only minor problem I had was that it did not follow the ""First Class"" comic storyline, but 10 minutes in I stopped caring because the 1960's aesthetic they went for is the equivalent of a James Bond movie. The friendships plus differences between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier & Magneto are so engaging to watch, while Kevin Bacon was an astounding villain (Was it me or does January Jones scream ""Fembot""). Overall, the story worked well and the characters and themes the ""X-Men"" were originally made for were very present. Fear of mutants (Originally a shot at Communism), and the ingenious idea of ""Mutant-Warfare"" used during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Final Verdict: Though we still got to get through ""Green Lantern"" and ""Captain America"" this year, ""X-Men"" is literally first class. 8/10.","

"X-Men: First Class","lewiskendell","13 June 2011","""I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.""Congrats to Matthew Vaughn for getting the X-Men franchise back on track after the spiraling quality of X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First Class is an exciting prequel that changes the tone drastically from the other X-men movies, takes some risks, and delivers a movie that stands with X2 as the best in the franchise. The positives start with the cast, which is almost universally great. You might think that some of the lesser known characters heavily featured in this installment might be a detriment, but it really gives an opportunity to focus on the most important characters: Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lenhsherr (Michael Fassbender), Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence), and Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, clearly having a ball). The story is tight and interesting throughout. Real life events are weaved through the X-Men universe, grounding the plot in reality in a way that really works. It's easy to follow for newcomers, while there are tons of little things that will leave those familiar with X-Men lore with quick grins on their faces. The movie isn't perfect, however. The plethora of B-characters occasionally lead to clunky action scenes because of the nature of their powers, and some repeated abilities result in sequences that are perhaps a little too reminiscent of precious movies. The film is actually better when it focuses less on big action set-pieces, which is odd for a superhero flick but indicative of how well-written the script is. I also had a problem with Beast, who started out as a great addition to the movie and ended up as somewhat of misfire because of a really poor costume job. It just looked bad. All the other costumes and special effects were fantastic, though.First Class is a total success, in my book. Entertaining throughout, full of memorable moments, and cast exceptionally well. It doesn't feel like the previous X-Men films, but that's not a bad thing. First Class stands on its own despite its prequel status, and turns the franchise around with some timely and fresh ideas.","

"X-Men: First Class","virindra","1 October 2011","I liked the x-men movies and I still do. What I didn't liked was that James McAvoi was in this new movie. I didn't like him a an actor, but he changed my mind with participating in this movie. McAvoi Has learned to act in a mature way, he did it very good. Many actors can learn from him, and I never thought I would say that.Overall acting was good, great action. I liked Kevin Bacon, I always have liked him as an actor. What was I surprised to see him. And also Michael Ironside who gained a lot of weight over the years. I'll never forget his role in Total Recall. It was a pity he got a small part in this movie, but still was great to see him acting.Special effects were great. It is very tricky to make a prequel, especially when it has a trilogy behind of it. After seeing a new movie, it is always easy to say that this is the best x-men movie ever. That this movie is better that the previous three. But still, without the previous movies, this movie would never been made.Background music was awesome, it sounded a bit like the music from Inception. It suited great with the movie.(Oh yes, I forgot mentioning Hugh Jackman).","

"X-Men: First Class","cdjh-81125","13 January 2017","X Men is one of my favourite franchises of all time I've liked most of them but I wasn't entirely sure if this film was going to be my cup of tea but I could not have been more far off and could not have loved it more. The whole plot of this film revolves around the friendship between Xavier and Eric, even though we knew that they were eventually going to fall out the filmmakers could not have done a better job at portraying their friendship. They are very well set up as very different characters and feel as if they can both achieve what they want through each other. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender was amazing and it helped to make the film much more investing. Jennifer Lawrence was also fantastic in this movie as Mystique she real carried her characters conflicted nature throughout. The villains in this film were also fantastic, ill admit their motivations were a bit conventional but it terms of pure threat level and back story they were done just right and set up as the perfect opposing force to the mutants. Another thing that I loved about this movie is that all the characters contribute something to the plot whether it be through there abilities or opinions it proves that the X Men franchise is much more than just pure superhero entertainment but thought provoking drama that in some ways mirrors real life. We got to see things in this film that we have never seen in any of the other films in this series, for one we see younger more relatable versions of Professor X and Magneto, we see Charles as a young bachelor and his humble beginnings, we see a vulnerable and in some ways reckless Magneto and it not only adds something to this film but to the franchise itself. Another thing we saw in this film that we've never seen in any other X Men films is he actual recruitment and training of the mutants, we get to see just how Xavier did it and lived up to all expectations. When we eventually see the fall out of Magneto and Professor X it's heartbreaking, we see just how similar yet different both of them are and it really helps to give context to the rest of the franchise. This film was not only a gift to all fans of X Men but a very entertaining, thought provoking drama that builds up and gives context to a lot of events that we've heard about in the other films. All the casting was perfect, McAvoy and Fassbender have absolutely amazing chemistry and is easily one of this franchises best instalments. 100%/A+","

"X-Men: First Class","mardalsfossen01","3 January 2019","So this movie does great actually, it shows us the background of our known mutants of X-Men, X2 and The Last Stand and I think they did a great job here. But I think it's questionable what they focused on in X-Men and X2 and therefore this is what they had to deal with in this prequel.
The whole X-Men saga has a bit too much of a teen feeling around it imo, so it's watchable for the brighter masses and younger people and I'm not a huge fan of it. I like the special effects and parts of it and the X-Men universe has great potential, but I'm not fully sold on the whole franchise yet. I actually think Origins:Wolverine was one of the best X-Men movies since it felt more mature. I yet have to watch all of the franchise, still missing some of the puzzles. I have hopes in 'Logan' !","

"X-Men: First Class","axlrhodes","16 May 2012","After three X-Men films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for Wolverine in a film of the same name, i might be forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours and watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise. Turns out, contrary to my expectations, i had a great time. This is an origins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down with exposition. The film is surprisingly light on it's feet and has many fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy performances. Michael Fassbender shines for the good guys as Magneto while Kevin Bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his role as a bad guy. My only disappointment was the performance of James McAvoy, i found his character hard to believe and more importantly, hard to like. Something just seemed a little forced. Full credit must go to Matthew Vaughn for pulling this off. I was a huge fan of Kick Ass and if it weren't for how much i loved that film, i may never have tried this. I'm glad i did.","

"X-Men: First Class","slowcando","11 August 2023","I haven't seen any X-Men before but seen as I'm enjoying a 3D-Bluray phase I decided to put Days of Future Past in my shopping basket (supposedly one of the best superhero movies, and great 3D showcase).After a bit of googling turns out I can't just watch that on its own, I should check out First Class beforehand. So I did....X-Men: First Class (2D version) is a bogstandard uninspired superhero action flick with simple genre-cliché plotting & cheap dated-looking CGI - and generally too much CGI for things that are better suited with practical FX, like ship-models. Dramatically, the film feels like it has a few missed opportunities which might've given it some edge.Fassbender is nicely watchable, the rest of the cast so-so. Kevin Bacon's villain isn't convincing or intimidating. The set-pieces didn't feel particularly 'epic'. Dialogue overall is pretty basic. Camera-work quite dull, some sweeps were clearly computer-generated.Still, I was mildly entertained...not bored and didn't skip. Certainly not a bad movie...that's hardly a recommendation, tho'.Here's hoping the 3D-wow effect (and hopefully better FX) of Days of Future Past will provide more spectacle than First Class...as it is it's borderline I'm still willing to check it out.","

"X-Men: First Class","toastandcereal","19 September 2011","I haven't read the comics (though I plan to) but I have watched all movies and enjoyed all of them. I was so looking forward to watching this movie, one of my friends who is a movie buff loved it a lot and understandably I wanted to see it as soon as I could.I wish I hadn't wasted those two hours of my life. The whole movie feels like a Bond film, just like a lot of other people here have said. There's the classic Bond villain who wants to kill everyone without an actual explanation, his blonde sidekick who does everything he tells her to and looks like a Bond girl. The submarine with the hidden room is horribly Bond-like too. I can understand why Magneto wants to kill Shaw so much, anyone would want revenge, but this movie is just stupid. The movie cuts from Magneto being 12 years old in the war to 30 years old. What happened all that time? Was he just getting high, and steadily angrier about his mother's death? Also, I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this, but why did Magneto have to keep changing from English to American to German, and then randomly at the end, IRISH? I HATED the way Mystique just left her best friend who has loved her and cared for her most of her life, with a bullet in his spine, to go off and have adventures with Magneto. Just because you get bullied for being a 'freak' doesn't mean you leave your best friend on the floor potentially dying. It just goes to show how much the director of this film doesn't 'get' the X-Men story. The women in this film are all exploited as sexual animals, constantly in underwear or tight fitting clothes or short skirts. They all have to look perfect. I also didn't appreciate the comment one of the FBI men say at the end after the female FBI agent tells them about Xavier's kiss. He says 'This is why women shouldn't be allowed in the FBI' or something like that.I hated the whole film, I truly feel like I've wasted 2 hours of my life. If you like this movie, you're an idiot. Simple as. It wasn't even boring, it's just that it was so bad that I wanted to throw my laptop at the wall. Download it for free if you're going to watch this crap.","

"X-Men: First Class","IndyMan_88","1 June 2011","Saw this on the day it came out. The local Cinema was packed with audiences, though sadly not for this but perhaps fans of Pirates and Kung Fu Panda 2. Which is a shame as this more darkly comic, brutal and engaging sequel is more than what the 4th instalment of the Pirates' films has promised.This film has the subtle whit, the daring and brutal action (coin scene), emotion, character development and welded plot that is required from these types of superhero/comic films. This film succeeds where the rushed complexion of X3 and Wolverine: X-Men Origins left us feeling hollow.This film is most on par with X2 (X-Men 2/X-Men United), exceeding X1 and surely exceeding X3 and Wolverine combined. The real stars are James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the brilliant Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and elusive Erik Lensherr (Magneto) respectively. They play the parts will similar presence and calibre of their former counterparts Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. They reinvigorate the characters adding further depth, energy and a likability which allows us to develop an affection for them and we become sympathetic to Magneto especially as he deals with internal demons and the power he releases. Kevin Bacon' Sebastian Shaw as the central villain really is a surprise. He pulls it off excellently with good amount of Machiavellian manipulation and power, which stems the actions of Magneto. He doesn't do internal monologues or make some small evil scheme feel like a grandiose escapade, to quote a beloved character from ""The Dark Knight"", 'some men, just want to watch the world burn' by initiating WW3. As well as being a period piece, the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the intense climate of fear and paranoia driving the countries leaders is well told. Very much akin to Alan Moore's Watchmen and subsequent 2008 film by Zack Snyder. Additional to him is the femme fatale, right-hand woman, January Jones' Emma Frost who can rival Prof. X. She provides an excellent performance, chivalry is definitely not dead. The young mutant cast is an ensemble of likable, learning kids who get thrown into the mix very early on. The key themes identified were Acceptance and Dominance; Prof X and Magneto. Conflicting ideals that sometimes meet head on and diverge violently. Matthew Vaughn didn't herald much of the creative ideas of this film, as the hand of Bryan Singer is felt in the control of plot and character development. But regardless, there IS character development! Dir. Matthew Vaughn has pulled off a excellent superhero summer action film with enough endeavours and allegorical metaphors to keep us busy. It doesn't feel too Bryan Singer-esqe but it feels rejuvenated with a much more mature sense of style. Overall - 8.5/10I have to watch this again.","

The rest of the cast members were solid, but these three stood out far beyond my expectations, which were high to begin with.Although there might be some mythological errors in terms of the comics being adapted to the big screen, it's definitely something that can easily be over-looked.The CGI, dialogue, action, acting, and script were in perfect unison.There really isn't much more you could ask for from this film, except another one just like it to keep the X-Men franchise as strong as it can and should be.","

Yes, there is some ropey effects at time, and Michael Fassbender's Irish brogue comes out in the last 20 minutes of the film, and that's the only reason I didn't rate this a 10! Even so, the film is tightly directly, brilliantly filmed and scored; the plot is engaging and exciting, and the central performances are superb. I didn't think I say this, but: Sir Ian who? Sir Patrick who? (N.b. they are still brilliant, but McAvoy and Fassbender are too)I won't go overboard, but the film had me on the edge of my seat a lot and I was SO happy to see what I wanted: a real bad-ass Magneto. Erik, as he is here, is like a proto-Bond with superpowers and a bad attitude. I loved the re-use (and subtle re-filming) of the original concentration camp opening, and the subsequent rage shown by Erik when his mother dies. Nazi helmets never looked so figure hugging... and Michael Fassbender steals every scene he's in (in my opinion). Oh yes, and there's a brilliant cameo from a certain hairy actor who delivers the film's ""f-bomb"". In summary, a exciting reinvigoration that I will see again and again, ignoring the tiny tiny flaws.","

Perfectly cast, brilliantly paced with great humor and lovely surprises thrown in for good measure. All the actors were great and truly brought the characters to life. They captured their essence and watching their stories unfold was very entertaining.The entire team behind this movie deserves a standing ovation for pulling off a reboot to the franchise so flawlessly.Any comic book fan is bound to enjoy it. Enough reading, go see it if you haven't already. It's time well spent!","

"X-Men: First Class","Zeta-One","25 May 2015","For a 2011 film, I believe this was simply amazing. It was because of this particular film that I grew interested in the X-Men- before that, I never really thought they were interesting, with the exception of Wolverine and Deadpool and others.This film had a fantastic storyline, starting with Charles Xavier and Raven's backstory and Erik Lensherr's backstory. From there, they became full-grown adults, or mutants, and will soon meet each other and create a team to help the government.The acting in this film was simply spectacular, primarily Micheal Fassbender as Magneto. I loved his acting, and it gave a nice, menacing feel that a villain should have.The effects in this film was over-the-top, and there was a adequate amount of action. The scenes were just right for its age group, it was not too violent. At the same time, the scenes were awesome, especially those with Micheal Fassbender and James McAvoy.Over all, this film is one of the best X-Men movies to date. The actors truly gave it their all. If you're a X-Men fan and like a good action and sci-fi film, do yourself a favor and watch this.","

"X-Men: First Class","Emmanuel_S","30 October 2014","A revealing prequel to the X-Men saga. Unlike any movie of the trilogy, this one has a decent plot and good characters development. Indeed, it allows us to discover how everything unfolded and why the characters are in the predicaments that they are in the trilogy. Many of the characters that we have in the X-men trilogy are replaced by younger actors in order to fit the story which is happening in the past. For instance, James McAvoy has taken over Patrick Steward as Professor Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as a young Magneto. Together they both offer a different and new perspective on the rivalry those two characters have towards one another. Highly Recommended!","

"X-Men: First Class","Samiam3","11 September 2011","Although not underwhelming, There is something missing from X-Men first class. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough. As an origin story X-Men first class did an adequate job of getting the characters where they need to be without too much contrivance, As an action film, it's coherent and competent, often visually stimulating, but the story was a bit scrappy. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough.Michael Fassbender may have second billing but the movie belongs to him. The majority of the drama in the film surrounds him, and subsequently his performance was the best. James MacAvoy doesn't quite have Fassbender's commanding presence but he brings a nice slyness to the picture. Jennifer Lawrence meanwhile is just a waste of talent in a role that is surprisingly under defined, and as Raven, she looked a little clunky.As I said, the film is a little slow to get going but the climax was strong enough. I was impressed with the camera work, and the overall assembly was nice, The appearance of Michael Ironside was a cute touch My only comments would be that Beast looks too much like Cookie monster, and Kevin Bacon spends a bit to much time in a Greek helmet that looks rather big on him.Looking back on the experience, I'll say that X-Men first class has skill but the product is incomplete. It's a body that needs a little more flesh on it.","

"X-Men: First Class","jmcginn174","16 June 2011","Like many people was hesitant about a new X-Men movie that was part prequel part reboot. I have a fondness toward the first three X-Men movies. And Unlike many people out there I really enjoyed X-MEN 3 and think it is a really underrated movie. Sure Brett Ratner's directing wasn't great but the story was good and so was the action. I also love how they weren't afraid to kill off the main characters. My biggest problem with the movie was the over abundance of characters the threw into the movie. I know it sounds like I'm giving a review for X-Men: The Last Stand but I wanted to make it clear I really like the previous films and wasn't sure about a reboot/prequel just like I'm nervous about the new Spiderman movie. Though after seeing this movie I view it more as a prequel.Now I was wrong X-MEN: First Class is a great movie and will probably be the best comic book movie of the summer. With the already underwhelming THOR. THE GREEN LANTERN which in all honesty doesn't look that good and CAPTAIN America which I really hope is good.One of the first things I need to talk about is the actors and many people may not recognize or remember. First Kevin Bacon who hasn't been in a lot of movies recently steals the movie as Sebastian Shaw as he brings such live and zeal to the character and I'm disappointed he won't be around for the enviable sequels. Then there's James McAvoy who hasn't done anything recognizable outside of Wanted. He plays Charles Xavior who I will always remember as Patrick Steward. He was the perfect Professor X. Still McAvoy did a good job as a you Xavior. Michael Fassbender as Magneto I had never heard of and again I had a fondness for the excellent actor Ian McKellen. I thought Michael did a excellent job as a young tortured Magneto and he even looks like a young Mckellen. Next I need to give a shout out to the movie great movie SUNSHINE and the actress Rose Byrne(Moira MacTaggert) who has been in many good movies and is a great actress. Then there are two supporting characters who I don't think had any lines but were great. The two are Riptide(Álex González) and Azazel(Jason Flemyng) who stole the show from the young X-MEN which include Havok, Mystique, Beast, and Banshee. That was one of the small flaws with this movie was them. I just didn't care that much about them. It felt like they were taking space from the more important characters like the relationship between Xavior and Magneto. One last thing I always like to give a shout out to actors who don't get enough work and aren't well recognized. The first is Oliver Platt who character has no name in this movie but plays a high ranking agent in the CIA. Oliver Platt is a fun actor who doesn't get enough work. The last person is Michael Ironside who plays a Captain of a American Navy ship. Michael Ironside isn't a star but a great supporting actor who's had great supporting roles in such movies such as Total Recall, Top Gun, Starship Troopers and others. Though you might recognize his voice more as he's done work for The Splinter Cell game series as the lead Sam Fisher, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League / Justice League Unlimited to name a few.The story that was blended into actual history was done really well. Especially Sebastian Shaw using the Cuba Missile Crisis for his own end was well done. The biggest problem I had with the story was the pacing of the movie. It's a small flaw but I wish they had edited out the scenes where the new X-Men students were training. I just thought they weren't really necessary but I think I might be nit picking with that. The action was really great especially in the middle of the movie when Shaw invades a CIA base. The climax was really good but they could have edited a few seconds out of it but again I think I'm nit picking with that when the action was really great.The directing by Matthew Vaughn was really well done but he's had practice with his three earlier films in Layer Cake, Stardust, and Kickass which were all good films. Again the only flaw I had his directing was the pacing of the film and editing.Oh yes the two cameos by actors from the first films which confirmed for me that this movies and the ones that follows are prequels. The first and longer scene was with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine though he probably hasn't been taken by the government yet. That scene was great and funny. Then there was the quick appearance of Rebecca Romijn which I though was nice.Overall this movie was great and out does any of the previous films which were good and I can't wait for the next film.","

"X-Men: First Class","nogodnomasters","25 May 2019","The movie gives you some quick backgrounds on 4 of the characters, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The rest you have to guess at. And if you are like me, and have never read the comics, you are clueless and sit back and enjoy all the women in lingerie. It boils down to a good vs. evil scenario, which I can understand.The good guys create a machine that will locate other mutants. Charles is able to cleverly locate all the mutants during a single music montage. Meanwhile Kevin Bacon wants to start an all out nuclear war so the radiation will kill all the humans and only leave the mutants. This is remake of the history of the Cuban missile crisis.As always, great special effects. Background knowledge of the characters and other movies would be a plus, such as cameo by Hugh Jackman or Rebecca Romijn, but not necessary to enjoy the film.The nuclear reactor controls on the submarine were totally bogus for any era. Favorite line: ""I have been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.""F-bomb (thanks Hugh for the F.O.) sexual situations and ""Avatar"" nudity. Excellent prequel.","

"X-Men: First Class","paul_haakonsen","9 July 2011","Now, I am writing this review as a person who is not overly fan over superheroes in general and not a fan of the x-men movies as per se. Sure the first four x-men movies were entertain, even for a casual non-fan as myself, but this ""X-Men: First Class"" was a step up from the previous movies.Not being super familiar with the story and origins of the characters portrayed in ""X-Men: First Class"", then I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the comic books. But for someone who have read only a handful of the comics, then this movie proved to be rather interesting and exciting. And I do believe that you were given a fair and meaningful enough background story as to whom these mutants are and what drives them.The effects in the movie were quite cool and nice to look at. And the movie is carried by a good solid story and lots of action. Plus you have a bunch of character building going on as well, so this really worked well for the movie. But of course a movie is nothing without a good ensemble of cast. And they had managed to put together quite a good selection of people for ""X-Men: First Class"". Kevin Bacon really did a good job in portraying Sebastian Shaw, the villain of the movie. But he was not alone to carry the movie, actually I think that James McAvoy (playing Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (playing Magneto), Nicholas Hoult (playing Beast) and Jason Flemyng (playing Azazel) also helped the movie along quite nicely.""X-Men: First Class"" is, in my opinion, a good supplement to the X-Men movies series. And it is filled with action from start till end. And for a non-fan of X-Men, the movie provides good entertainment and also provides you with lots of background story for the X-Men universe. Which, in my case, really made me want to sit down and watch the previous X-Men movies again, just for the sheer fun of it.One thing did puzzle me though, the advanced level of technology that was available in the 1960s. Come on. It was a bit too much. That was the only thing about the movie the was a downer.Thumbs up, way up, for ""X-Men: First Class"".","

"X-Men: First Class","brando647","28 September 2011","We haven't had a good X-Men film since Bryan Singer left the franchise, and I was ready to give up hope on the whole deal after that Wolverine catastrophe. Word of development on a prequel arrived and all I could think was, ""This isn't going to end well."" Even with director Matthew Vaughn attached, I couldn't get excited. The trailer grabbed my attention but did nothing to quell my fears. I mean, another origin story (strike one) with teenage characters (strike 2) and only one member of the original comic line-up? How could this possibly end in anything but cinematic disaster? Well, I was wrong to doubt Vaughn and this movie quickly became one of my favorite movies of 2011. The film is set in the early 60s and establishes the friendship of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Former Nazi and current head of the Hellfire Club Sebastian Shaw is involved with both the United States and Russia with plans of pushing the global superpowers towards nuclear war. Xavier is recruited by the C.I.A. to assemble a team of mutants to combat Shaw and his team of mutant henchmen, while Lehnsherr has plans of his own. He and Shaw have a history going back to young Lehnsherr's imprisonment in a concentration camp during World War II where Shaw killed his mother, and Lehnsherr wants revenge.Sadly, Fox has an established movie canon for the X-Men series so they weren't able to use the original comic team (Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, and Angel) and instead we're left with sort of an X-Men B-team with a handful of characters that probably wouldn't have been more than a cameo in any other X-film. Hank McCoy/Beast is the only member of the original team who makes it into the film and, while Nicholas Hoult did a fine job as the socially awkward scientist on a personal mission to rid himself of his visible deformities, it's the actual appearance of Beast that doesn't sit too well with me. The Beast effects in THE LAST STAND were actually pretty cool in my opinion and probably the best we'd get without going CG. In FIRST CLASS, Beast looks like someone took an old-fashioned Wolfman costume and soaked it in blue dye. I eventually got over it, but it was a bit of a distraction. The rest of the team is filled out with Banshee, Angel (not the original Angel, but actually Tempest from a later X-Men comic series), Havok, Mystique, and Darwin. You can see they were reaching a bit when finding characters to fill out their movie, but the team comes together better than I expected. The fact that we've got a younger team does lead to some corny moments; the scene in which the team assigns themselves their ""codenames"" feels forced, but I guess it had to happen if we want to start recognizing them as Havok, Banshee, and Angel instead of Alex, Sean, anduhAngel.The big three in this film are James McAvoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Lehnsherr), and Kevin Bacon (Shaw). McAvoy and Fassbender didn't necessarily try to mimic the performances of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan from the original trilogy. These characters really feel as if the actors tried to make it their own, but it worked out so well that it feels as if they'd later develop into the Stewart/McKellan incarnations. Since this film really focuses on Xavier and Lehnsherr, it's important that the two had such great chemistry as it depicts the strength of their relationship and how their views on mutant/human relations eventually drove them apart. And Kevin Bacon continues the comeback he started in the wicked indie superhero-wannabe film SUPER. Bacon is awesome as Shaw. He just makes a great villain; he knows how to play evil and he comes across as so cool that it's hard to totally hate the man. It just sucks his team didn't live up to his level. January Jones is bland as Emma Frost, and both Azazel and Riptide (I actually had to check the credits to find this character's name) are nothing more than muscle with no development. I really hope Azazel gets some more attention in future films.I was surprised this film didn't do better at the box office. It was easily the best superhero movie of 2011 but it couldn't make the same cash as the other 2011 Marvel films. I loved how this film focused just as much on the characters as it did the action. There's plenty of great action in the movie, but we also get a great balance of scenes with the characters themselves: training the team, strengthening the Xavier/Lehnsherr bond, etc. Even with so much attention paid to the story, this movie never slows down and the 60s atmosphere gave the film a retro vibe that I couldn't get enough of. It's a lot of fun and I can honestly say I think it's at least as good as X2, possibly better. Matthew Vaughn has done what I'd begun thinking was impossible: creating an awesome new X-Men film.","

"X-Men: First Class","TxMike","26 August 2012","It is interesting how this movie came about, as the other X-Men movies were being made th writer/director/actors often had to make a reference to what might have happened in earlier years, in the time when the characters were younger. Thus ""X-Men Origins"" was made. There is a good explanation of the process in the DVD extras.While this story actually begins in the 1940s during the Nazi suppression of the Jews, most of it takes place in 1962 when the characters would have been in their 20s. In fact, to take advantage of real historical elements, the climax of this movie is the October 1962 Cuban Missle crisis, and the young X-Men have a role in its outcome.James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lehnsherr, who becomes known as Magneto. This story shows how they were friends, and started out on the same side of justice. It also shows what contributed to their going in different directions, and how Xavier ended up wheelchair bound. The most evil character is Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, intent on facilitating a Third World War. Jennifer Lawrence of most recently ""Hunger Games"" fame as Katniss, is Raven here, eventually becoming known as Mystique. We see how she showed up at Xavier's home as a 10-year-old and was befriended by him.All in all a good movie, with incredible and incredulous action in the final scenes.","

"X-Men: First Class","athena24","25 May 2014","Matthew Vaughn doesn't have the class of Brian Singer. X-men: first class is not the worst installment (I would honor X-Men origins: Wolverine with this title) but considering the standards set by the first two X-Men movies, it is quite a flop.Aside from repetitive patterned script, stupid moments and inconsistencies regarding the previous installments it tried to close all loose ends and to explain everything. It seems that the writers (one of which is the director) didn't have the long vision. They didn't think about spanning some of the events on several movies, building relationships so when they break them, it would be believable. Instead, everything is thrown at once. How Charles and Erik meet, how Erik/Magneto becomes the bad guy, Charles' injury (and more pieces on Beast and Mystique). So, considering the plot and the large portion of action, there is not much depth in the friendship of Erik and Charles. And worst of all is that half of these loose end closing occurs at the last 10 minutes. So it seemed very rushed and unbelievable.The bright spot is the majority of the cast. McAvoy and January Jones were very good. Fassbender is absolutely fantastic.","

Matthew Vaughn has sealed his credibility as a solid storyteller who weaves poignant character developments with fun action sequences. The set pieces, balance, pacing and cameos are well crafted. I had reservation about the choices of mutants before watching the movie but now I understand that they were selected for the right reasons. And that is to present the audience with a prequel that not only raises the bar for the franchise but also revives my faith in the series. X-Men 3 and Wolverine were short of disasters, but here the cast and crews have managed to breath a new life into a series that was getting near to downright embarrassment. Even though the movie is set as a prequel it never failed to deliver a mature performance unmarred by asinine silliness that often haunts action/superheroes genre when majority of the cast involves adolescents.The movie is largely based on the New X-Men saga by Grant Morrison, but it's not considered canon because it sits between the main and the Ultimate timelines. The stage is set, the quality is astounding so let's bring on the rest of the sequels.","

Is everyone against everyone? In this movie you get to learn how some mutants got their names and how war began between mutants and humans. The mutants in this movie are awesome and original. They have some very interesting abilities, especially the villains. There is a decent amount of action, however I would've liked to have seen more - The acting is decent but not great. I feel as though Kevin Bacon's role could've been better - I have seen him do better. The ending seemed a bit rushed, however, this movie left possibility for a new and even more interesting X-Men franchise.","

The mutants have yet to make themselves public, but when the ruthless villain Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon),in 1962, connives the Russians to move missiles into Cuba, Xavier and Magneto gather the small band of mutants as a covert CIA operation to use their powers to stop what would be known as the Cuban Missile Crises. Formidable skills make for a masterful climax as the world escapes a nuclear Armageddon. I am not actually an X-Men fan, but I am a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the mutant named Raven.

"X-Men: First Class","SeussMeTub","2 June 2011","Bryan Singer needs to stop destroying the X-Men franchise.It's bad enough that this movie throws continuity out the window (well, the previous X-Men movies already did that so it's not like its a new thing...) but what's even worse is that it recycles the EXACT SAME MESSAGE that occurred in the first three X-Men movies: yes, we know mutants are different, yes we know mutants have dangerous powers, yes we know there are good and bad mutants but... ENOUGH ALREADY!!! People are sick and tired of being pounded over the head with the same theme; this one-trick pony has had it's day. If you look at the X-Men comic books they fought a wide variety of villains, each with their own different agenda- unfortunately in this movie every villain has the same agenda just as before- destroy the human race- like, how many times has that been done? Why not just watch the first 3 X-Men movies? Why bother with this? Prof X (James McAvoy) now is younger, can walk and has hair and is a free-loving hipster in the 60's while Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is a suave, James Bond-like assassin. Director Matt Vaughn tries a new retro look for a 60's era reboot of the franchise but unfortunately it falls back to the same clichés that screwed up the franchise in the first place- namely that the movies are totally different than the comic books they are based on. If you look at the best comic book movie adaptations such as Raimi's Spider Man or Nolan's Batman movies they are very faithful to the source material.The X-Men franchise is almost totally different from its roots: with the exception of Beast this X-Men team is completely different from the X-Men's first class of the comic books (Havok is supposed to be Cyclop's younger brother but here it seems he is more like his father and his powers are completely different- and inexplicable and not to mention that his back story is never revealed so you don't even know how he fits in to all of it)- there are even massive logic gaps in continuity (in one scene the entire US government knows about the existence of Xavier and his mutants and towards the ending it seems only one CIA agent is aware of it and in another scene a secret agent spies on a mutant telepath in the other room and the mutant is completely unaware of it even though she's suppose to be able to read minds). With the exception of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) all the other characters in the movie are nothing more than plot pieces and exist solely as gimmicks. This points out to another weakness in the franchise: too many mutant characters and not enough script to develop their personalities so this means you hardly notice or care about them if they die.Sure, the 60's retro look set pieces are nice and the special effects are up to par but the rest of it just isn't there.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","saadgkhan","28 August 2011","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS – CATCH IT ( A- ) X-Men: First Class introducing into the friendship of Professor-X and Magneto. The movie starts with their childhood, where we see how one lives a perfect life and other tormented. We have been aware of story and believes of Professor X and Magneto. They have been clearly showed in previous X movies. The X-Men:First Class is a really good movie which some great action sequences specially in the end and where all young mutants get attacked by Sebastian Shaw and his disciples. The movie did a really decent job in presenting each mutant and its talent plus in bringing variety of youngsters all together. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbeder complemented each other to the fullest. Though, I felt we didn't get to see them spending much quality time which indicate the true friendship. Michael Fassbender has this power to adopt every role, this man never disappoints. He shines through his roles. James McAvoy was a perfect choice to play Mr.Nice & Naughty Professor-X. after the lead mutants, Jennifer Lawrance Aka. Raven Aka. Mystique got the best scope in showing her adjustment with being BLUE. Stepping into Hot shoes of Rebecca Romijn is a huge deal. We have been seeing Mystique unique, tall and sexy. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like her but she sue is great actress. I think she was better human than Mystique in this movie. Nicholas Hoult is charming as geek but as Beast, well he was more of a wolf than a Beast. Lucas Till is stunning in swinging flames. I just love his heavy voice since Hanna Montana. Zoe Kravitz is sweet little sultry Angel. Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee is cool, he get to do some amazing stunts. Edi Gathegi as Darwin, Jason Flemyng as Azazel, Álex González as Riptide were good. Now lets talk about other cast Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert is top on the weird CIA Agent. Oliver Platt as The Man in Black was right out of ""The Big C"". Kevin Beccon as Sebastian Shaw is pretty good. He wasn't as strong but he was wicked. January Jones as Emma Frost is Ice-Cold and apparently if too be believed she is Ice Cold in real life too. I think it won't be wrong to say that this girl has become the 2nd most hated actress in Hollywood after Katherine heigl. Their imagine in media is not shaping good. Anyways just like in Unknown she was Ice cold in this movie too and luckily she was the Perfect choice. So, the X-Men: First Class is almost perfect movie with some great action and performances but still their was something missing just like in Thor. There is something missing in movies that has not been able to made them A 101% Perfect Roller coaster ride.

'First Class' is, indeed, first class, and returns the X-Men name back to cinematic glory.One of the key ingredients for this movie's success is the emotional resonance that the audience gleans from the characters. The screenwriters, producers, and director seem to fully connect with the X-Men mythos, and while this movie is not 100% true to the events in the comics, the emotional resonance is intact, and that's really what matters most.Another key ingredient is the cast, which is practically devoid of A-list actors. These actors put their best foot forward, even at the risk of being typecast, which in my view, is very honourably. It goes to show how much respect the material is garnered.As an example, Michael Fassbender has to be the most intense actor in recent memory. His performance in Inglourious Basterds only hints at the intensity that he displays in this film. His Erik is at times sympathetic, other times morally reprehensible, but we as an audience fully understand the reasons behind his actions, almost like we can put ourselves in his shoes if we experienced the same trauma he experienced. This creates as close to an Oscar-worthy performance as one can possibly hope to achieve. To not get a nomination would be a crime.James McAvoy's excellent performance as the future Professor Xavier is the other side of the coin to Erik's intensity; he initially represents conformity to the homo sapien ideal rather than homo superior. He uses his gift as more of a means to pick up women rather than more noble and heroic pursuits. It's not until Moira McTaggert enters his life that he acts on those pursuits, even if he's initially compelled by the CIA to do so.Xavier's initial meeting with Mr. Lehnsherr is a life-changing moment; he went from being pacifist to activist after knowing first-hand what Erik went through during the Holocaust. This, in turn, leads to an understanding between the two that develops into a deep friendship that will be tested later in the film.The accompanying cast holds their own; Jennifer Lawrence as Raven makes a complete character metamorphesis from someone who's eager to please in order to conform, to someone who's fully comfortable with who she is. Conformity vs free-will is a component that is examined time and again throughout the film at pivotal moments to great effect.I haven't even touched on the time period when the movie takes place, which has about as much to do with the plot as everything else. Another well thought-out component.I highly recommend this film if you are into the X-Men, or just into really good movies. You will *not* be disappointed.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","Bunuel1976","18 July 2011","The X-MEN series is surely among the more consistent superhero franchises out there: despite the blot that was X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), the film-makers went on and gave us the back-story of Professor X, Magneto and, to a lesser extent, Mystique. Having been impressed with all of director Vaughn's previous efforts and particularly the similar KICK-ASS (2010), I was looking forward to this being, at least, miles ahead of WOLVERINE (another apparently solo effort of whom is being prepped for next year!) – which it certainly proved to be.Since we had already been given glimpses into Magneto's childhood in the very first entry, Vaughn (and producer Bryan Singer, who had directed the original) expands upon it, while also presenting us with the friendship – that would eventually turn into deadly animosity – between the two polar leaders of the future Mutant struggle (Mystique, too, had been 'adopted' by Charles Xavier but eventually changed allegiance to serve his nemesis Magneto). This element here, however, lands the film into problems of logic: of course, you might say that, if one is willing to accept such a fantastic concept to begin with, why bother with the details – but I am sure that, if these had been better thought out, the film would have emerged an even stronger outing. Anyway, here goes: since both Xavier and Mystique are depicted as quite young at this stage, why is it that in the original series, he is seen as a bald and white-haired figure while she can still pass muster as a stunning femme fatale (incidentally, Rebecca Romijn puts in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo when her incarnation here, Jennifer Lawrence, ages to womanhood in the wake of Magneto's mocking of her excessive youth!). In the same breadth, while recruiting mutants, Professor X and Magneto (then still Eric Lehnsherr) happen upon the irascible Logan, Wolverine himself – but, rather than being played by a younger counterpart, Hugh Jackman already essays the part...so, then, why does it take Professor X some 30 years (during which time the former has not aged at all!) to bring him around to his way of thinking?!Typically, with a film concerning numerous superheroes or, to put it more aptly, gifted persons, some are allowed to shine more than others (in both good and evil camps, mind you); it was a mistake, however, to sideline Mystique's character as just one of the teens, since she had been part of the team from the very start (even before Eric!). Most of the others, in fact, come across as mere show-offs (despite Xavier's diligence in harnessing their individual power) – with Beast's complete transformation evoking uneasy parallels to the TEEN WOLF movies from the 1980s! The real villain here, then, is Kevin Bacon who progresses from Nazi associate to big-time industrialist to Mutant megalomaniac (when he is prevented from unleashing World War III, by making judicious use of stock footage pertaining to the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s, he decides to turn himself into a one-man thermo-nuclear reactor!). Also, while the presence of CIA agent and nominal heroine Rose Byrne does not really come to bear on the central plot, she eventually proves a pivotal pawn in Xavier's crippling accident – which definitely severs his ties with Eric (then again, Mystique ought to have been more considerate towards her mentor at this particularly difficult moment!).In the end, the film's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of the two leads and, thankfully, both James McAvoy as Xavier and especially Michael Fassbender (incidentally, both he and Bacon are made to speak in a variety of languages throughout!) as Eric deliver the goods. For the record, the film's most awe-inspiring moment/special effect is the one where Magneto 'compels' Bacon's sub out of the sea (in full view of dumb-founded American and Russian battleship personnel!) and brings it to land on a sandy beach – where the ultimate battle (at least of this 'new' first entry) is raged. By the way, it was also nice to see the likes of Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade Sherbedgia in minor roles.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","martinrobertson300482","5 June 2011","First off, I'm truly glad that this franchise hasn't chickened out too the current ""reboot"" trend. ""X-men - first class"" is all the better for acting out as a prequel too the original trilogy (all 3 films off which I liked) and in being set in the 60's, still manages too stand alone and feel like a fresh take on the entire superhero thing.Perhaps the poorly received ""Wolverine"" adds too the awesomeness off this one. I went in not really knowing if the film was going too be any good or not, so was so overly happy when it rocked! I had my doubts about some off the cast, and off course, the characters being used here aren't as cool as the better ones already used in the first 3 films. But the flicks crammed with great moments, is fast paced, has riveting action, and has excellent turns from Michael Fassbender and Kevin Bacon amongst others.The best thing in the film though is Fassbender. Who'd off thought anyone could top Iain McKellon as Magneto? But here Fassbender is superb, making the character his own. Seeing the character as young as he is here makes him far more bad-ass too, which is ultimately what makes him the stand out star off the movie. I wanted too cheer at almost every scene Fassbender had as this truly awesome villain.Still not sure about James McAvoy as Charles Xavier though. OK he pulls it off. But I can't help but feel he just doesn't suit the part, least off all because off that mass off dark he has. Also, out off all the fairly forgettable continuity errors in the movie (Spoiler alert ahead!) his character ending up in his wheelchair at the end is perhaps the only one I find hard too over look. Considering we seen Patrick Stewart standing in flashbacks presumably set after this in earlier films.Not sure about the girl who played Mystic either too be honest, although it was cool too see who is probably one off the most interesting characters from the ""x-men"" in amongst this lot too.All the ravings about this being the best one since ""x-men 2"" are totally true though. More ""first class"" x-men movies please!",NA
"X-Men: First Class","jack_face","3 June 2011","The movie starts by introducing young Erik and Charles. Erik in the concentration camps, Charles meeting a young Mystique for the first time. What's not explained is where Charles was or why Mystique was even there to begin with. Was it an early school for mutants? Was she an intruder? Nothing was explained other than showing Charles to be a gentle soul and that would carry over throughout the rest of the flick with the exception of him using the same pickup line to hit on chicks in bars. No trailer advertised Kevin Bacon to be in the movie at all so there was that reaction from the audience when people recognized him. It was kinda like seeing Sigourney Weaver and even Michelle Rodriguez in Avatar. The best bit of acting in the whole movie? Bill Milner's, who played young Erik, facial expressions after seeing his mother shot in front of him.Despite the large cast of characters, this is a plot-driven movie. It all revolves around the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis. In this case, you know there's a twist and it ain't a bad one but the execution was weak. I like how they took a real life event and used it as a backdrop for the growing mutant phenomena. I don't like how almost everything was watered down. I don't have much for complaints about the acting but this is essentially a war movie that focuses on things going on outside of the main conflict, mainly the mutants.Mutants are introduced slowly but surely and X team members are given code names along the way. Reminds me a lot of G.I. Joe Renegades but that's a very well written cartoon. The script here isn't bad. The direction is what's lacking. It just doesn't come across as serious enough and I can understand why considering the franchise. There are those emotional, crying moments but not enough hardcore, violent ones. Nothing to make you really wanna hate the protagonist (Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw). Shaw's ideals are like those of the primates in the Planet of the Apes movies (minus Aldo) where mutant shall not kill mutant. Can't hate the guy for that, can you?Lots to like but let's look at the characters and how the lack of attention in that department hurts the movie. First off, during the gentleman's club scene, they show a lot of scantily clad chicks. Where's the problem with that, you ask? The movie is based in 1962. Chicks didn't look then the way they do now so it was bad casting on that front. It's like casting Olivia Wilde in Cowboys & Aliens; a movie based in the 1800's.The hair styles are another issue. Alex Summers has a pretty modern do along with the Angel character. Emma Frost's hair, and emotionless characterization, was atrocious. It looked like she was wearing a wig with a whole can of mousse in it. Just terrible. Speaking of Angel, considering her real life heritage and skin color in the movie, would she really be openly employed as a stripper in a predominately white club in the 60's? And with tattoos? Redbone's got it bad enough these days, imagine how it must have been back then? And being a 60's based movie, it didn't have a 60's feel at all.And my biggest complaint is the characterization. X-fans know who the Darwin character is. The way he was killed didn't make sense considering that he constantly evolves to survive. That includes becoming pure energy as proved in the comics. I'm surprised they even used Darwin in this movie. The actor who played him looked the part perfectly, I'll admit that. But why they always gotta kill the black guy first?There were some issues with nationalities but you don't hear anyone complaining about it like whitewashing in movies like The Last Airbender. Moira's supposed to be Scottish. Banshee Irish. Does Magneto really look or sound Jewish to you? He was underpowered when the movie started but suddenly has greater control and levitation abilities at the end. Charles' influence certainly couldn't have been the cause of that level of change so quickly. Script issue! That's when Magneto goes villain but it wasn't on the level of Hulk Hogan going Hollywood at Bash at the Beach '96. What could have been this great cinematic moment didn't have enough behind it to matter which is exactly how the overall viewing experience can be described.You'd think the ending of the movie with all the special effects like the raised submarine would be totally epic but it's not. The problem there IS the special effects. The submarine crash looks just as bad as the plane crash scene in Air Force One. They should have hired the people who did the plane crash scene in Knowing because that looked very realistic. Is there sequel potential here? I'd say there's definitely room for more X movies but they should stand alone like the James Bond flicks.The movie checked in at just over 2 hours. Didn't feel like it was too long or too short. The movie was entertaining but it's too simple for my taste. I like my movies with more depth and a less comic-book style ending than the one it presented. I give this 5.5 out of 10 stars. Nothing special or memorable really happens and it's not worth paying any amount of money for but if you're an X-fan, you're gonna see it anyway. You're better off waiting for the DVD because you'll be disappointed shelling out the dough at a movie theater for this. Then again, some are more easily impressed than others. I'm part of the others. Don't bother sticking around after the credits. Nothing happens to the verbal dismay of those who stuck around hoping for something.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","CinemaSerf","3 December 2022","If it's not sacrilegious for a Brit, I found this outing for the ""X-Men"" to be far better without the presence of the two elderly thespians who usually underpin these adventures. James McCoy takes on the mantle of the younger ""Xavier"" with Michael Fassbender introducing us to the role of ""Erik"". The former has the ability to read minds, his friend to manipulate metal. By means of flashbacks, we learn the back story for both of these characters, illustrating how they met and started to work together to ensure that their kind were safe and sound in an increasingly hostile world of human paranoia and suspicion. They are making progress until the re-emergence of ""Shaw"" (Kevin Bacon). Now he and ""Erik"" have a past - and the latter blames the other for leading atrocities carried out by the Nazis on his Polish family during WWII. His determination to seek revenge causes a rift between the two friends, and soon they - and their respective followers - are at loggerheads whilst a dangerous nuclear war looms for an humanity caught up in a devious cross-fire. Bacon isn't at his best here, he isn't remotely menacing - but the others, including Jennifer Lawrence's ""Raven"" and Nicholas Hoult's geeky ""Hank"" work well to give us quite an action-packed flavour of the birth of ""Magneto"" and of the foundations of his later hostilities with the ""X-Men"". The visual effects deliver well and the underlying narrative actually offers us a bit to think about - forgiveness, vengeance, fear and intolerance are all touched upon with a superior script that doesn't entirely rely on the effects and pyrotechnics to make it's point. This film works better on a big screen, these stories never really thrive on the television, and is easily - for my money - the best of the franchise I've yet seen.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","zell-rainbow","17 July 2011","The good things: good special/virtual effectsThe bad things: I have to say... for a long time fan of X-Men this is by far the worst movie yet.The call it First Class, when actually only one of the original X-Men is there (Beast) and poorly characterized... Magneto for once never had his powers as a child, he developed them later on on his adulthood on account of disease. Xavier was not crippled by a stupid ricochet but by the physical consequences of an astral battle with the King of shadows. Havok, now there's a kicker... him appearing way before his brother Alex. Are you serious!? And again with the diamond form of Emma Frost... Sebastian Shaw the absolute bad guy!? well played there, but he was for a long time an underling of Magneto, and does not die from a ""coin disorder"" -.-' he's immortal (yes one of the X-Eternals like Sam Guthrie)!!!And Xavier and Mystique's brotherly love!? really!?Please stop ruining these characters... how does Stan Lee uphold this is beyond my capability of understanding...

"X-Men: First Class","ollie1939-97-957994","4 July 2011","This is by far my favorite of the X Men movies. This is the most interesting of all the series and probably my favorite superhero movie based off any Marvel comic book. I never read the comics so my only experience with the X Men were the movies. Apart from X men 2 which I thought was a fun movie, all the previous X Men movies were average summer blockbusters. This one is far better than all of them mostly because of the cast.James McAvoy and Michael Fassebender do the best performances in the film as Professor Xavier and Magneto. Fassebender in particular does a good job as he has to show himself as a tortured soul who will later become the main villain of the Xmen series. The other actor also do a good job like Kevin Bacon as the mad Sebastion Shaw. Hugh Jackman also has a great cameo as Wolverine. The only bad performance I could think of was January Jones as Emma Frost as her performance is pretty wooden. Otherwise this is the best film to come out of this summer so far and one of the best superhero films ever.",NA

Director Matthew Vaughn (once previously slated to helm a chapter of the series) balances the fantastic visual effects set pieces (i.e. Magneto lifting a submarine out of the ocean) and allows his young cast of gifted actors (the aforementioned protagonists and Lawrence too as Mystique) to bring some depth with an undercurrent of darkness much needed for the showcase of mutants being recruited to both sides of good and evil.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","Wuchakk","2 December 2016","Released in 2011 and directed by Matthew Vaughn, ""X-Men: First Class"" chronicles the origins of the mutant superheroes and super-villains in 1962 when the US government decides to enlist the talents of people with superhuman abilities. This is before Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) took the names Professor X and Magneto and were friends rather than arch-nemeses. They and their teen team must stop the diabolical Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) from using the Cuban Missile Crisis to start a nuclear war to increase his power. Jennifer Lawrence appears as Mystique and Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert. Nicholas Hoult is on hand as Hank McCoy/Beast.It's interesting to go back to the early 60s when Xavier and Erik were friends and observe how the team got started, not to mention the eventual rift (the story deviates from the comic, of course, although there are some similarities). McAvoy easily carries the movie as Xavier; and Fassbender is effective as Magneto (and more fitting than Ian McKellen). I prefer Lawrence to Rebecca Romijn simply because she's curvier and cuter. There's a cameo with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and it's hilarious.Most of the movie is decent espionage akin to James Bond, albeit with super-powers. Where the film shines is the entire last act and epilogue. The sequences on the island shore are very well done. Just remember: The brother always dies first.ADDITIONAL CAST: Oliver Platt appears as a Fed who organizes the team; January Jones as Emma Frost; Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee; Zoë Kravitz as Angel; Jason Flemyng as Azazel; Álex González as Riptide; Lucas Till as Havok; and Edi Gathegi as Darwin.The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Englefield House, Berkshire, England (Xavier's school); London (Swiss bank); other parts of England; Hatley Castle, Colwood, British Columbia; Los Angeles (dock scenes); Villa La Angostura, Neuquén, Argentina; and Jekyll Island, Georgia (climatic island scenes).GRADE: B",NA
"X-Men: First Class","CowherPowerForever","22 May 2014","So in the year 2011 X-Men got a prequel movie, once thought to be a reboot, but as we now know the upcoming Days of Future Past takes place in the same timeline as the original X-Men films. To me that is a cop out because First Class didn't so as well as it could have at the box office. Moving on to talk about this film, First Class in its prequel nature is amazing, well acted, great action, and just downright fun. In my opinion it is the best prequel or reboot so far in the superhero genre.The film was directed by Matthew Vaughn who had just finished up filming the 2010 smash hit, Kick Ass. Vaughn brings amazing skills to this film. Usually in a film like like the CG is overused. Not so much in in this film in my opinion. Sure there are uses of CG in the bigger scene, but that is expected in a film like this. However this film is a more character driven story so the CG was toned down nicely for the film. While this film lacks that amazing battle scene this genre is use to seeing it doesn't really bring down the film. Prequel films can be slower, and while that is true of this film, you cannot help but love the characters. The acting makes that all stick. From the top to the bottom this film is very well acted. Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr(later becomes Magneto) steals every scene he is in. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier is a delight to see as this character. He makes the role his own no doubt about it. The only real down spot of the acting is of course the average at best actress, January Jones. Thankfully her scenes are short, not to mention her character is rather cold, and she is best at playing those types of roles.The film was written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn. All of these writers had past experience writing in the superhero genre. As I mention above this story is character driven and doesn't really rely on too much action. Yet surprisingly they were able to keep your attention so amazingly. The back story on Erik Lensherr, which drives the main storyline, is so deep and done perfectly. Without Fassbender and Bacon, I'm not quite sure how well this story would have played out. Lensherr's parents are put in a Nazi concentration camp while he is just a young boy, and Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) kills his mother right in front of him so he got angry enough to show off his mutant skills. This back story, as I just said is just fantastic to watch play out throughout the entire film. The writers deserve much respect for writing such a fantastic film.The film was composed by Henry Jackman who just recently scored the smash hit Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He also scored Kick Ass 1 & 2. While I did enjoy the score, it wasn't amazing. The last piece we hear as the films goes to dark is just amazing stuff to hear. Frankly though the rest is just about forgettable. His score in the 2014 summer blockbuster Captain America was much better.Overall this is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. The acting and the characters are perfect. Matthew Vaughn works the camera perfectly even though we do not see the normal usage of action scenes for a film like this. So with the newest X-Men movie coming out just hours from the time this review hits the internet, this is a must see movie for any fan of this genre, and all those people itching too see X-Men: Days of Future Past.9/10",NA
"X-Men: First Class","AaronCapenBanner","15 December 2013","Mathew Vaughn directed this second prequel(though fifth entry) in the franchise, set mostly in 1962, where young mutants Charles Xavier(played by James McAvoy) and Erik Lansherr(played by Michael Fassbender) are enlisted by the U.S. government to organize fellow mutants they locate through the use of the Cerebro, through which Charles uses his telepathic powers. Once together, they are attacked by evil mutant leader Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) who has a past with Erik(from WWII) that puts them on a collision course that will determine the future events that turn Erik into Magneto and lead his anti-human brotherhood of mutants. Surprisingly good film does a fine job filling in the back stories of key X-Men characters, who are well cast with younger actors. Lots of big-scale action scenes helped by a thoughtful script, and authentic recreation of the early 1960's.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","matt_hew","4 December 2011","If Matthew Vaughn was ordering desert he would order everything on the menu as well as wanting what the guy on the next table was having... and ending up with a overindulgent mess which has its nice bits but doesn't work as a dish.Unfortunately he applies these methods when trying to direct movies. With Layer Cake he tried to direct a gangland film like his mate Guy Ritchie (noted he was the producer for Lock, Stock & Snatch) and just created an indulgent carbon copy. Both Stardust (which was an interesting movie) and KickAss were overindulgent and crammed full of too many elements, characters and themes trying to tick too many boxes and please anything & everything.This has unfortunately been applied to X-Men: First Class.So how can you mess up an X-Men movie? Given that with any comic book movie those involved have been given the story (of multiples of from the different universes etc) in both written and pictorial form it would seem all thats required is to redirect this onto the screen. Problem is that due to the rich source material available to those in movieland they seem obsessed with taking too many elements and fusing them with their own spin with the result always being a mess of a movie.Throw Vaughn into the mix and its a big old mess of a movie trying too hard to be exceptional with what seems to be a very limited budget. Character choice and acting is weak with too many 'in-house' jokes about wheelchairs, going bald and an unnecessary cameo from Hugh Jackman.Given that the movie stands alone and shouldn't be considered a true prequel to the X-Men movies as it is a different 'take' on the X-Men it still tries to fit into the franchise (ie. with the Jackson cameo) which again is an unnecessary try hard addition.The movie trundles along jumping from one timeframe to the next –whilst at the same time jumping from one location to next with very little development in story or character leading to a disappointing conclusion (the paralysis of Prof.X which is thrown in at the end as both underwhelming afterthought which is neither accurate or required).All this said it is not a bad movie – and tries harder than the lazy Wolverine Movie, however unfortunately this movie tries too hard and Vaughn needs to give it up before he ruins anymore movies.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","mego_spillane1234","3 June 2011","Okay when treking to the cinema to see this please bear in mind that it was the third time i'd been in a week. I needed something to do so off I treked to see x-men. I thought the first two in the series were good but come on the last stand was actually shameful and wolverine wasn't exactly a masterpiece. So although I expected to enjoy it I wasn't expecting that much..The film was far better than I expected, I mean i should have guessed really Vaughn is a pretty good director (stardust is a secret fave of mine). Its refreshing to have wolverine out of the way with only a quick cameo, I mean what is everyones obsession with him anyway! James Macavoy is charming, I found myself dreading the moment when he loses the power to walk far more than I should have.Fassbender is also great, and both men make you forget that two of the worlds greatest actors have previously played them. The action is intense and there's more than enough to satisfy anyone. The effects were also pretty good especially when the beast becomes full on blue, as much as I missed Hoults incredibly cute face, he also looked great in blue.The standout for me was Lawerence as Mystique, she was great and brang substance to an important role. I've never really liked the character before but now I'm seeing her in a different light. Bacon is a crafty villain with a cool white interiored submarine but I seriously thought he was going to start dancing (i recently watched footloose for about the 50th time).Okay the films not perfect but its pretty good, Jones as Emma Frost was underused and the screen felt a bit overcrowded at times because there literally tons of mutants. But I'd say it's one of my fave so far this year, well way better than water for elephants thats for sure! btw i have spent a lot of time since i saw this movie attempting to move various metal objects with my hands and have sadly failed.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","tha_mongoose","1 June 2011","I'll preface this by being completely blunt. After watching the last X- Men, Rattner's bastard child, I was skeptic about another potential waste of my time.However, what made X-Men: The Last Stand mediocre made First Class splendid. First we have the cast. Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman are both questionable actors. Add Famke Jansen and Ana Paquin and you're heading for disaster. Which is what The Last Stand was. Even Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart couldn't save it, surrounded as they were.Fast forward to First Class and the quality already begins with the choice of director. It was inevitable that the man that brought us Layer Cake (and then showed his hand in the super-hero milieu with Kick-Ass) could somehow pull a decent X-Men movie off. No easy feat considering our expectations after what we'd seen before.The fresh set of actors selected for First Class was its crowning achievement. Fassbender and McAvoy are sublime together. Bacon's chemistry with Magneto is dynamite. Another phenomenon was present: even seemingly redundant (in their secondariness) roles were played by solid actors (such as the American and Russian ship commanders, and their politician counterparts). January Jones' good looks were put to their proper use, even if there was no palpable difference between her character Emma Frost and Cadence Flaherty, and Byrne showed heretofore unseen ability, if a little tame in comparison with the others present. Nicholas Hoult, after playing such a different person in Skins, was a pleasant surprise.First Class is another of Vaughn's marvelous brand of superhero movies. What we'd already seen in Kick-Ass we see here: the acting is so believable, and the story so carefully and craftily woven, that the end- result is more than just popcorn entertainment.You can usually tell how good a movie is when its length imposes no boundaries on your viewing of it. Well, First Class's 2 hours passed by in 5 minutes. There wasn't a single frame too many of cheese, the strings played in the right moments, and it seamlessly integrated first- rate action with an engaging plot.This is what movie-making is all about. Other directors should learn from Mr. Vaughn. He is an exquisite picture-maker. Hats off to you sir! 8/10.",NA

Superb entertainment delivered by Matthew Vaughn of Kick-ass fame, directing an engaging and dynamic cast. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are entirely convincing at Xavier and Lehnsherr, and they have strong support throughout a well-constructed story from both A-listers and up-and-coming young stars alike. Jennifer Lawrence is again worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled Mystique and January Jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs. Kevin Bacon has no trouble convincing as the personification of evil and the action hinges around his hideous masterplan, which is straightforward in its scope, but as usual with X-men it's the personal relationships where most of the real fireworks are flying. Great stuff - essential viewing for hero fans.",NA

This leads us to the second thing (or better make it thingS)...Visually poor, looking cheap (Banshee's little dress with ""wings"" anyone?!, Magneto's helmet at the end of the movie?!), boring, lame acting, childish, naive, soundtrack sucks, lacks smart and witty humour, lack of idea, McAvoy as Xavier -NO, the list goes on. In short - not something one would expect from an X-MEN movie.At the other hand Michael Fassbender has made a great role, Kevin Bacon is cool as he always is, Rose Byrne is cute and did a good job as CIA agent, Zoe Kravitz had a first role in major movie and it is a good thing for her career. Well, that is all...At the end, maybe I was subjective a bit, since I expected much more from the director of one of my favourite movies - Stardust!",NA
"X-Men: First Class","FeastMode","30 June 2019","I'm in love with this movie. I'm in love with director matthew vaughn. I'm in love with musical composer henry jackman. I'm in love with actors james mcavoy, michael fassbender and rose byrn (and MANY others that i really like. What a cast).BEASTLY movie. Other than being an awesome entertaining superhero movie, i think it was a very well-made movie overall. Lots of good characters with arcs and emotional moments that make you feel what they are feeling. Awesome dialogue and debating (every conversation between charles and erik was great).Emotionally powerful, some great and creative scenes. Lots of memorable moments. One of my all-time favorite musical score. This movie made Magneto my favorite super villain. (7 viewings, 4/8/2021)SPOILERSA really great origin story for how the x-men first started, as well as the origins of magneto, professor x and mystique. This movie made me tear up multiple times, due to a combination of directing, storytelling and phenomenal acting performances. The scene where charles gives erik his old memory, and the scene when charles is shot. Wow it gets me good. And the final shot of the movie where magneto announces his name gives me the business.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","johnnymacbest","18 June 2011","Just came back from seeing X-Men: First Class and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement. More than impressed. I was invigorated and excited at the same time; mainly due to the fact that Matthew Vaugn has done a remarkable job on the characterizations of the heroes and villains of this wondrous comic-book flick. This film wipes all of the crude and horrid memories of X-Men: The Last Stand. A much more focused and character-driven piece of epic cinema, X-Men: First Class rightfully deserves all the credit it gets from mainstream audiences and comic-book fans alike.I'm not quite sure why there would be an uproar on the costumes that our heroes wear, but it really works; especially in the context in which the story is set that spans from the early days of World War 2 to the turbulent 1960's. Although some of the scenes play out like a certain spy series, nevertheless First Class has it's own vibe, tone, and mood. Already I'm pumped to see the next installment of the X-Men's early days of fighting for a world that once accepted them as saviors of a international crisis, but a dark cloud awaits them all, hero and villain alike.So is First Class better than The Last Stand? The answer is an overwhelmingly exuberant YES!!!! Miles ahead of Brett Ratner's schlock at what Bryan Singer accomplished. Matthew Vaugn has brought an integrity, dignity, and most important of all: heart. A true testament of the spirit of the X-Men comics that encompasses a wide variety of issues plaguing mankind that exists in this day and age. First Class is first rate entertainment for not only just the action, but also the brain. See it. It's worth every penny.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","paulclaassen","22 April 2019","So, this is where it all began. This prequel shows us how Professor Xavier (and others) came to be. It's no secret, I'm no superhero movie fan, but I do enjoy the X-Men films and characters. I enjoy the way the characters can be humble, vulnerable and emotional. It sets itself apart from other superhero movies in that respect.Michael Fassbender steals the show as young Erik, who would become Magneto. He simply is sensational in this film. James McAvoy stars as Charles Xavier and does the character justice, as well. The film's visual effects are amazing!The film might not be as action-packed as the original Trilogy, but it is nevertheless entertaining and very exciting. 'First Class' also sends out a very strong message of acceptance in society.",NA

"X-Men: First Class","facebook-124-955845","4 August 2011","A long-time collector of comic books, my expectations were high when Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' came out. Happily, my expectations were met and I enjoyed the movie. Singer's 'X2: X-Men United' blew me away, taking superhero films to a new level. Singer then left to make the disappointing 'Superman Returns"", leaving Brett Ratner ('Rush Hour"" trilogy) to direct the extremely disappointing 'X-Men: The Last Stand', which was followed by Gavin Hood's ('Rendition') 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'; which was also a letdown. After 10 years and 4 movies, the X-Men franchise had run its course. To usher in a new era, Bryan Singer was brought in as a producer and Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass') as director of 'X-Men: First Class'. There was belief that a prequel movie was the way to go; and the script put together was first class, like it's title.'X-Men: First Class"" is the story of two boys, who become men, and the moments in their lives that defined them. Erik Lensherr (Bill Milner, Michael Fassbender), grows up in war torn, Nazi occupied Poland. Torn from his parents and then being used as a test subject due to his ability to control metal, by the diabolical Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon), Erik spends much of his young adult life trying to find and get revenge on the evil Doctor. Simultaneously in Westchester, NY, Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher/James McAvoy) discovers a girl, a shape-shifter disguised as his mother, in his kitchen searching for food. As Charles grows, along with his adopted sister, the shape-shifter named Raven, he graduates from Oxford University as an expert in Genetic Studies. The CIA, thanks to Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) recruits Charles to help in capturing the terrorist organization known as the Hellfire Club; Emma Frost (January Jones), Riptide (Álex González), and Azazel (Jason Flemyng), led by Sebastian Shawn formerly Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon). As the CIA and Erik converge on Shaw/Schmidt, Charles saves Erik. As their friendship grows, they are organized with putting together a team to track down the Hellfire Club. Along with scientist, and fellow mutant Hank McCoy's (Nicholas Hoult) creation Cerebro, Charles is able to locate and enlist a team of young mutants, along with Raven to help their cause. Joining them in the fight is: Angel (Zoë Kravitz), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Darwin (Edi Gathegi) and Havoc (Lucas Till). Things escalate as the team must work together to not only stop Shaw and the Hellfire Club and save the world from a nuclear war but show that although they are different, they are still human.'X-Men: First Class' is about revenge, war, and prejudice. Although the movie is about super powered individuals, it's predominantly story driven. There's action, but not loud, intolerable explosions or gunshots we've grown accustomed to in summer movies. There's CGI, but it's done within the story and doesn't feel like it's overwhelming. The ensemble cast wasn't full of A-list actors, but the casting was solid and each performance was memorable. Kevin Bacon's Dr. Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw was campy, but not overdone and January Jones' Emma Frost is absolutely stunning. The relationship between Xavier and Raven was convincingly genuine. Michael Fassbender made Erik/Magneto a very conflicted character, and made the role his own. Overall, 'X-Men: First Class' graduates with the highest of honors, and a Masters degree in entertainment.Summer movie Grade: A+ (My favorite movie of the summer so far!)

"X-Men: First Class","mergatroid-1","14 September 2011","I'm sorry if I'm sexist or something, but Emma Frost in this movie is nowhere near as sexy as she is in the comics and cartoons. Also, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique was a really poor choice. She just doesn't do it for me. She has this little chubby baby face, the makeup on here wasn't anywhere near as well done as the first 3 movies, her acting wasn't the greatest and, again I'm sorry, but she didn't come close to Rebecca Romijn in the first three movies. Not for makeup, not for acting, not for the action sequences and not for her sexiness. I feel she was a very poor choice for this roll.But hey, other than that it was a good movie. Great story, good actors, script and effects were well done. No other complaints about it.I loved Logan's small roll in this flick. Perfect.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","robert-kaleta","17 July 2011","As I am a huge X-Men fan, having read the comics and watched the animated series many, many, many times, I eagerly waited for the ""First Class"". I hoped the writers would stick to the comic story-line, as they mostly did in previous movies. But after couple of minutes, I was already thinking - ""This can't be good"". First, Xavier's and Mystique's friendship - where that come from? I think it was done purposely, so Mystique could be in the movie at all - joining Magneto at the end and making legitimate ground for her character. Than there's the scene, when Magneto's mother is killed - why on Earth Erik didn't kill Shaw then, instead of crushing tables and cabinets? And most of all - team. Havok and Banshee were OK, but the girl with wings who looked more like Wasp from Avengers? What happened to Bobby Drake or Warren Worthington? Oh, I now what. ""We have shown Iceman as a teenager in X-Men (1), so he can't possibly be alive in 1960's"". That's the biggest plot hole in the whole X-Men film universe - by messing around with characters age (not mentioning lack of characteristic Scottish accent of Moira MacTaggart), it caused weird time continuum where some heroes are already mature and battle-ready, and some are never mentioned (Cyclops, Jean). Adding to that, some things weren't explained in the film at all, like: who's Emma Frost? What is she doing with Shaw? What's a Hellfire Club? Who the heck are these guys helping Shaw? And why? And there's plenty of more such things. On the positive side I have to say that fight scenes are pretty damn good - quick and well made. So as for actors - they are quite good at portraying comic book heroes and villains; and brief Wolverine cameo was worth every second of it :) As for the plot, my feelings are that it was a tool to establish a starting point for a future exploitation, and not a material for the movie itself. The whole movie looked like it's only goal was to make Professor X handicapped, Magneto an evil mutant and Mystique his accomplice. The Cuban crisis idea was neat, but because of all that, it served only as a battlefield for good and bad guys. Summing it up, I have to say, that it was a good movie if you just want to watch some nice special effects sequences, but for a real X-Men fan, this film's story is too much stretched form the original to give a eyes feast.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","cherold","2 December 2011","I've have really liked the other X-Men movies, but somehow I never felt as excited as I thought I should feel. But I found this movie incredibly exciting. I love the ingenuity of the back story. I love the cool special effects, especially the way Mystique's scales ripple as she changes and the way Azazel appears and disappears (an effect that is used in some really exciting ways). I love the speed and the wit and the performances.The movie is not perfect. One character switches sides with absolutely no insight from the script as to why, and I thought that was an unfortunate and lazy choice. But overall this is a terrific movie that is everything I wanted it to be.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","thesouthfamily2-552-707097","27 May 2014","A franchise reboot reminiscent of the franchise that had been going downhill since The Last Stand, here comes a movie that is still fast, fresh and fun. At the heart of First Class is the story of how close friends become bitter enemies and of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto. This is the highlight of the movie as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) meet, become friends, and then turn against each other due to their different ideologies.As for the supporting cast... it was pretty promising (for the most part). Kevin Bacon brings his acting chops to the test, and he delivers almost every scene with charm, personality and charisma. Bacon makes effortless a larger-than-life role that evolves from guffawing Nazi sadist to slick Bondian baddie. Jennifer Lawrence adds vulnerability to the character who would become Mystique, as well as Nicholas Hoult as a pre-mature Beast. These two had great chemistry together. Rose Bryne as Moira, a CIA agent that helps the mutants, also does a great job in being a human interacting with mutants. And lastly, January Jones as Emma Frost, was a great addition to the team. While comic book purists may not like her character, in my opinion, she did a great job in being a part of the villains. Strangely, it's the rest of the supporting cast who feel underplayed. The rest of the mutants are denied a back-story - and in the cases, any real dialogue between the rest of characters. They are defined by their powers, and not by their characters.Fortunately, there's a lot more going on than character development. I really liked that it was a mixture of a spy movie and an action/adventure movie. The action is pretty crisp and clean, and I was actually invested in it. The climax is a lot of fun, especially with what they can get away with, showing all the mutants and the powers they have learned to control.This movie reminds me a lot of why I liked the Singer films (who is back in the fold as producer). Marvel and mixes it with Bond and Batman, bromance and coming-of-age angst to create a cool, character-driven actioner with a social conscience that's something to be proud of.Final Verdict: It's a classy addition to the X-series that expertly establishes a hoard of characters, navigates a Cold War plot and squeezes a tear for a friendship failed. Dream-team casting and quality FX make this a great movie.",NA
"X-Men: First Class","Smells_Like_Cheese","1 July 2011","At last, I finally saw X-Men: First Class, seemed to take forever. I grew up with the cartoon X-Men, the good ol' 90's, how fun they were. When they made the movies, it seemed like we actually had great comic book films as well. The thing that makes X-Men so wonderful is that growing up, a lot of us feel different and X-Men was a way of saying that it's cool to be different and to embrace yourself. Everyone knows the characters and we each have our favorite. But to see where it all began was what I really wanted to know, what was the friendship between Charles and Erik like before their feud started? It's pretty much the equivalent of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, two men who had the same principles , but different concepts and how to execute their plans. Also this movie for me at least seemed to be a mixture of X-Men and the Bond films, I know this can't be just me, because a lot of the styles were similar and the villains seemed really inspired. X-Men: First Class could have been a sell out film for the summer, but turned into a really great film.In 1962, Erik Lensherr is tracking down Schmidt to take revenge for killing his parents. In England, Oxford University graduate Charles Xavier is publishing his thesis on mutation; Raven, his foster sister, lives with him. A man named MacTaggert is seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, convinces him and Raven to join her at the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. The CIA executives sponsor the mutants and invites them to the CIA's secret ""Division X"" facility. Xavier locates Shaw, arriving in time to stop Lensherr, who had attacked Shaw, from drowning as Shaw escapes. Xavier brings Lensherr to Division X, where they meet scientist Hank McCoy, a prehensile-footed mutant whom Xavier inadvertently outs as a mutant. Xavier uses a mutant-locating device to find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw. He and Lensherr find other mutants and now vow to stop Schmidt from taking over the Cold War and making it into WWIII.The effects are very CGI at times, but every Magneto effect was killer, especially him lifting the submarine out of the water, it looked incredible. The powers for the newbies were cool and a lot of fun to choose which one I would rather have, I think I want each power for a different day. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender had great chemistry and their friendship was extremely strong on camera. The scene between them where Xavier is telling Erik how to control his powers was extremely moving, no pun intended. My only complaint being is that the film is a bit long and does drag on a bit, it seems like every film released in the theater is over 2 hours long. If the film carries on well, I'm perfectly fine with it, but in this case, the film could have been trimmed down a bit. But still, the movie is definitely worth the watch, it's a great summer blockbuster and in general a good movie that was a worthy addition to a terrific series of movies.8/10",NA
"X-Men: First Class","southdavid","4 June 2019","Prep for ""Dark Phoenix"" begins with the first of the prequel films for the main X-men series.Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) discovered his magnetic mutant powers under extreme duress as Sebastian Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) exploits the Nazi's reign of terror to instigate his own experiments. 12 years later, the now renamed Sebastian Shaw is interfering in both the Military and political landscapes in the US and the USSR, which brings him to the attention of the CIA, who contact Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) an expert on genetic mutations to assist them. But Lensherr has not forgotten the terrors of his youth, and is looking for revenge.It was interesting to watch ""First Class"" again after all these years. In a few aspects, particularly from a visual standpoint, CGI has moved on quite a lot in just the 8 years since and a few of the effects don't stand up that well. There's no ""weight"" to a lot of them and a few specific examples, Beast running with Xavier as one, just look awful. Away from those concerns though, the film is pretty solid. It has one of the most straightforward and logical plotlines of film in this series, I understood the motivations for each of character and only really found that Mystique's ""accepting who she really is"" turnaround came without sufficient motivation. It's got quite a lot of humorous moments and a few references to the wider series, McAvoy talking about losing his fair, the Stryker family making their first appearance, what looks like a young Storm, Cameos from Rebecca Romjin and, of course, Hugh Jackman.There are issues beyond the CGI. Michael Fassbender's accent wavers throughout and he's very Irish in the scenes towards the end. It's a little odd to see Mystique throw herself at both Beast and Magneto at a couple of points, you feel like they wouldn't make those choices were the film being made today. Minor quibbles in a very entertaining additional to the franchise.",NA
