"Top_Dawg_Critic","11 July 2017","I don't want to give much away, but of all of the X-Men ever made, this is one of my favorites!The additional cast was concerning, but overall actually added to this film.Of course the rest of the usual cast were on point as usual, but what made this movie different than the others, was not the battle of good vs evil, but the timeline differences and the new cast's involvement.A great addition to the X-Men franchise, and a 9/10 from me!","

"thepriceofpayne","10 June 2019","By brilliantly combining the original cast and our new first class crew, all while telling a classic comic book storyline and giving it JUSTICE. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" gives us everything we love about this franchise and more, with great performances all around and giving us a magnificent hybrid conclusion/beginning that sets the stage for what's yet to come.","

"TheLittleSongbird","27 July 2014","The first X-Men was a good, fun, well-made start to the series, though with a yet-to-find-its-feet feel. That was found with X2, which turned out to be bigger, darker and even better. X-Men The Last Stand I didn't find quite as terrible as its reputed to be but it was very disappointing and a big step-down, it had its moments like the visuals, some good performances and the action but suffered from too much going on, a script that was sorely lacking and too many characters that were largely underdeveloped and out of character. X Men Origins: Wolverine was just as disappointing and with very similar pros and cons to The Last Stand. The Wolverine was a definite improvement but still had a fair share of flaws. And First Class was excellent. I was hugely excited for Days of Future Past because the cast is such a good one and the return of Bryan Singer promised much. And Days of Future Past didn't disappoint at all. It is a visually very stylish film that has an even darker and more audacious feel than the rest of the films in the series, the special effects are of great quality and everything looks very slick. The score is the best since the one for X2 in terms of memorability and how it fits and the script is the sharpest since X2 as well and is probably the best and most well-balanced script of all the X-Men films put together. There's a bit of humour that is subtle and genuinely funny, not feeling overly-broad or overkill, while there are plenty of suspenseful and emotional parts. Bryan Singer makes a triumphant come-back, the action sequences really thrill especially the battle between past and future X-Men to stop annihilation while the drama resonates. Great also was the quietly powerful tete-a-tete between the two Xaviers. There is a fair bit going on and there are a lot of characters, but the solid pacing, chemistry between the characters/actors and how well everything's balanced in the writing makes the story thrilling yet with plenty of space to allow you to feel emotion, and for the amount of characters there are here a vast majority of the characters have real personality and soul(plus they're treated with respect), something which Last Stand and Origins did not do. The cast are spot on, Hugh Jackman is grizzled and charismatic while bringing the subdued quality he brought to The Wolverine and Jennifer Lawrence is surprisingly good as Mystique(blue is definitely not the warmest colour with her), the transformation sequences are as eye-popping as they were in X2. James McAvoy gives one of his better performances here and Michael Fassbender is suave and calculating. As the older versions of Professor X and Magneto, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen make a welcome return, Stewart is cool and McKellen is menacing yet with a sympathetic quality, Magneto is much more than a one-dimensional villain(a mistake Last Stand made and that the first two films did not). Evan Peters is excellent too as Quicksilver, like how Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler almost stole the show in X2 Peters' Quicksilver almost did here, a definite scene stealer. Nicholas Hoult is fine as Beast and is very well made-up, but Kelsey Grammar for me was a touch better, and Halle Berry gives her, by far, best performance of the series(the only time she really made an impression as Storm, who's also developed best). My only complaint for Days of Future Past is the cop-out ending(outside of the action), other than that it was a brilliant film that was not only the best X-Men film since the second but a big contender for the best of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"SnoopyStyle","4 February 2015","In the future, the world is devastated by constant war. Sentinels are robots created to hunt mutants. Xavier and Magneto team up with a plan to change history. Kitty Pryde sends Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) 50 years into the past to 1973. He has to find Xavier (James McAvoy), free Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and recruit them in a mission to stop the Sentinel program before it starts. They have to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who tries to kill weapons designer Trask (Peter Dinklage).This is a compelling sci-fi thriller achieving one of the most seamless transition from an old cast to the new. The story is terrific. It introduces Quicksilver as a fresh injection of fun. That's probably the only minor complaint. It needs a bit more fun to offset the serious tones. It's not really a complaint. OK! Forget about it. The new cast is set to take off in place of the old.","

"gogoschka-1","11 May 2014","I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/","

"shawneofthedead","16 May 2014","With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.","

"Hitchcoc","30 May 2014","I've seen them all because my son and I like to go to these big movies. Every time one comes out, I've forgotten who's who and what's what. This is of a different generation. What I see here is masterful storytelling, dynamic characters whose purpose isn't just to beat to a pulp or incinerate their opponents, but a culture that has developed around mutations at war with the people for whom they are saviors. Time travel can be quite touchy and this needs to be treated with kid gloves. The story begins in the present where things have gone badly for the recurring characters and their ilk. A race of killer robots has been launched against them and it becomes necessary for them to find a way to mutate time in order to prevent the killing of a man who has used the DNA a of Mystique to create these devils. Wolverine is chosen to go back because he is the one most capable of withstanding the perils of the trip. He must get a group the mutants to act on faith since they have no idea who he is. So much has been written, so what I will say that what follows is an amazing series of scenes filled with tension, humor, and clever intricacies of plot. There is a scene where a football stadium is uprooted and brought down around the White House (Nixon's White House) and used a prison enclosure. I will leave the long dramatic explanations of events to others. I really enjoyed this film.","

"IPyaarCinema","8 March 2021","Review By Kamal KQuite possibly the best of the X-Men franchise, both original and prequel reboots. The acting was amazing for a Sci-fi movie. James McAvoy's performance here was really good. The McAvoy/Stewart scene was pretty epic. I wish this was the last of the X-Men movies cause it was such a great bookend...but sadly they made more...crappy ones. Fight scenes were very good. Showcasing different powers were done well. Seeing the old X-men was very nostalgic and seeing their fates at the end was very heartbreaking if you ever watched the previous movies before the prequels.","

"CalRhys","5 June 2014","2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film.","

"bob the moo","5 October 2014","I don't remember being overly taken by the previous X-Men film, although I may be wrong because it has mostly slipped from my memory after it took quite some time for me to get around to watching it in the first place. Days of Future Past came out in a busy summer season and it did strike me as just another superhero blockbuster in a very crowded marketplace. Although it of course has much in common with other superhero films, X-Men doesn't directly take them on at their own game and, although it has the odd touch here and there, it deliberately avoids the knockabout comedy that The Avengers film and some of its offshoots has. Instead we get a darker plot that begins in the future where mutants are either enslaved or killed by robots designed specifically for that purpose. The plot device that triggers the time-travel is as easy to accept as anything else in the film, and it is delivered fairly straight which also helps. This gives us a plot where we know the stakes and the film plays it very well to keep things dramatic.Having very recently been disappointed by the superficial thrills of Godzilla, I pleased to find that Days of Future Past was an engaging and satisfying film to watch – although I personally think that its current very high rating on IMDb is partially down to an overreaction to low expectations set by First Class. The plot has some good twists and turns and it connects the future and present well. Special effects are well used throughout, with plenty going on that is visible (I'm looking at you Godzilla) and most importantly, is connected to the plot; so yes the film has spectacle, but it is spectacle that the viewer cares about rather than passively watches.The cast helps give the material some weight and, although some of them have comparatively little to do, they all do well enough with what they are given. Jackman is as good as presence as ever and there is a reason he and this character remain so constant through the series. Fassbender and McAvoy have good material to work with and they engage and convince as to their connection to their future castings of Stewart and McKellen. Lawrence is surprisingly good and although she seems a bit out of place at first, it is her performance that makes her character work. Dinklage is always watchable and he fits in well amongst a cast that includes many famous faces in roles small and big. The balance of all these names and faces is down to how enjoyable the script is, because even though we barely see some people, it makes sense within the context of the story being told, so doesn't feel like they are wasted (although I could have done with a few fewer in the final scenes).Days of Future Past is perhaps not as amazing as the high IMDb rating suggests, but it is an enjoyable and satisfying superhero movie with good edge and seriousness in the plot, which is all played straight aside from a few moments, helping it carry it off and keep the viewer engaged.","

"Amari-Sali","24 May 2014","My love for the X-Men was not born due to the comics, or even the cartoons, it was the video games. So, off the bat, let me say while I may know characters faces, and a bit about their background, largely I am quite oblivious to the various universes and stories. So walking in I didn't know much besides fairly recent news stories dealing with Rogue's part being cut, to Kitty seemingly being the one who was supposed to go to the past. Outside of that though, I was a clean slate. Making the movie quite the experience, even if sometimes confusing and surely with details lacking.Characters & StorySometime in the future, the sentinels have almost completed a genocide of not only living mutants, but those who would be the mothers/ fathers, or even grandparents of them. Not only that, mutant allies are killed. But, there remains hope. Said hope is entrusted in Logan/ Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who, through Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), is sent 50 years back in time to try to make the reconciliation of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy/ Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender/ Ian McKellen) happen far before both are senior citizens.Along this journey though, there is a need to address Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) position in all that happens, as she seems integral in either the destruction, or salvation, of mutant kind. All because of her interactions with one man: Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). The precursor to William Stryker (Josh Helman), who may not hate mutants, but surely is aware that with their rise comes mankind becoming obsolete, or downsized in the grand scheme of things. So, live or die, that is Mystque's decision, and with Logan having a limited time to change the past, catching and changing the mind of a highly illusive woman, with Xavier's help of course, is quite the task.PraiseWith this being a Marvel movie, especially X-Men, the biggest bit of praise first has to go to the special effects team. Between the fights against the sentinels, the transformations of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Mystque, as well as watching all mutants involved exhibiting their powers to varying degrees, it left me in awe enough to forget to take down notes at times. Also, as most Marvel movies have, there is a good use of humor, though it unfortunately isn't seen throughout but only in certain sections. Quicksilver (Evan Peters), for example, probably left the biggest impression on me because his interactions with Logan, Magneto and Xavier were hilarious, and definitely a highlight of the film. Peters way of delivering lines almost seemed Deadpool like.But, if you were to focus just on the story, and set aside the special effects and jokes, I'm slightly sad to say that the veterans do a far better job at bringing some sense of emotion to the story than the newcomers. Naturally, the genuine friendship between Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart makes the Magneto/ Professor X saga more than some re-imagined Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr. Their complicated history is masterfully crafted by McKellan and Stewart to the point they eclipse the other actors for their performances have various degrees of emotion, while everyone else seemingly only exhibit fear or self- loathing.CriticismAnd with that said, being someone who increasingly has watched Marvel films, I have to say I found it odd that the film with the largest amount of misfits, and those that have suffered, didn't lead to stronger performances. Which isn't to say they weren't good, though more so adequate, but perhaps with McKellen and Stewart there, using their veteran experience on how you could get a point, or feeling, across without overdoing it, in comparison it just makes the other actors look just good enough. Take for example the two major relationships in the movie: Young Xavier and Magneto, and Young Xavier and Mystique. Considering all that happens in the past is what is supposed to build toward the future, be it lost chemistry, or perhaps too many special effects to take into consideration, I found it hard to get lost in characters interacting and sensing a serious connection between them. Making it where the film leaped from past to present, it was like dealing with a bright enough light bulb to one which was luminous.Which to me was weird since in First Class there was good chemistry. But in this film there lacks consistency. Like a flickering light bulb you know you just put in, you know what should happen, and that it worked in the past, but don't understand why things aren't working now. And while I must note time constraints make it so long heart to hearts aren't possible in the film, I do feel like this was perhaps one of the few Marvel films, for me, which probably focused more the action and effects than it did characters and the story.Overall: Worth SeeingThough I must admit I felt a bit disappointed that the movie lacked a sense of heart, the drama of impending doom, watching Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart interact, as well as seeing all my favorite mutants, push this toward being a ""Worth Seeing."". For really, what comic book movie is really trying to aim for Oscar nominations? They are purely aimed at entertaining and keeping the franchise's name out there. And while I feel this film may not inspire someone to develop further knowledge of the X-Men universe to spoil the sequel, it is certainly good enough to keep you loyal.","

"edgereviews","28 May 2014","X-Men: Days Of Future Past' serves as a sequel to both 'X-Men: First Class' (which is excellent) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (which is pretty bad). Now, I used to be a pretty big X-Men fan a few years ago, but after the disappointments of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I kind of just stopped caring about the franchise, even though the subsequent two movies were actually very good (the aforementioned 'X-Men: First Class' and then 'The Wolverine'). That being said, I was still looking forward to 'Days Of Future Past', what with it being the return of the old 'X-Men' crew, and I was also moderately familiar with the 'Days Of Future Past' comic. I was just expecting it to be good though, but it turns out not only is 'Days Of Future Past' the best X-Men movie yet, it's also one of the best comic-book movies ever made.In 'Days Of Future Past', the X-Men of the future are facing extinction due to the sentinels which threaten to wipe them all out. They send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must recruit Professor X, Magneto and Mystique in order to change the course of history so that the X-Men may survive.First things first, this is a time travel movie, and time travel movies normally either go very well or very badly. 'Days Of Future Past' marks an occasion where it goes very well, as the time travel logic in this movie is very well thought out and makes perfect sense, I can't pick any holes in it. This movie even manages to validate 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which is something that I thought could never be done. It even feels weird just saying that, because righting the wrongs that those movies made is a huge, monumental task, yet this movie pulls it off perfectly.For a movie that's crowded with so many characters, it's surprising that all of the characters included feel meaningful and aren't shoehorned in. We have Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, and there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said. He is Wolverine, the role is made for him and he absolutely owns it. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr respectively, their characters have an amazing relationship and the two of them are just phenomenal at pulling it off. We also have the future X-Men cast with the like of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Ellen Page, and while they have a lot less screen time they're still great. I was surprised at how prominent a role Jennifer Lawrence had as Mystique, over the past few months I've had a growing dislike towards Jennifer Lawrence but I can't deny that she is great in this role. Then we have all of the new characters, like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), all of whom are great. But there is one new character who is greater than all, and that character is Quicksilver.Quicksilver in this movie is perfect. In fact, it's worth seeing this movie just for him. He doesn't have a huge amount of screen time and it comes fairly early on in the movie, but he is the best part of this film by far. There is one particular sequence with him in a kitchen, and it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The visuals in the scene are gorgeous, the music is perfect, and it's both hilarious and stunning. The way that Quicksilver's super speed effect has been done is amazing. Some people thought the costume looked goofy, but I think it works perfectly well considering the time period and the personality of the character. I've been a big fan of Evan Peters for a while, and he is great in the role, he is very entertaining and has a great screen presence. I never thought I'd be saying this, but I doubt Marvel will be able to produce a better Quicksilver in 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' than the one that's on display here.But you know what I think all this great quality comes down to? Bryan Singer. I'm pretty sure Bryan Singer is just the perfect X-Men director. Even though up until now I thought 'X-Men: First Class' was the best of the X-Men franchise, it didn't really feel like the X-Men in the way that 'X-Men' and 'X2′ did. 'Days Of Future Past' nails that X-Men dynamic while still being an exceptionally good movie. Part of that X-Men dynamic comes from John Ottman's amazing score, as it's so good to finally hear his X-Men theme again.The action scenes are incredible, especially the opening one which uses some of the new mutant powers phenomenally, especially Blink's. The movie is very well paced, I never grew bored and I didn't want it to end.'Days Of Future Past' also surprisingly has a lot of very funny humour in it, but it's not humour that's just forced in for the sake of it, it all feel natural and within the confines of these characters. This film nails the comic book movie aspect; it has a plot which is clearly very serious yet it is still silly enough to remain a comic book film, unlike movies like 'Man Of Steel' and 'The Dark Knight' which go so dark that they just completely ditch the comic book aspect. There are also a few nice references that fans of the comics will get, which is just a small example of the great fan service this movie does for readers of the 'X-Men' comics.'Days Of Future Past' made me remember why I was such a big X-Men fan. It rekindled my love for the characters and story lines, and like I said above, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made.","

"eddie_baggins","21 October 2014","The X-Men series has been with us now for well over a decade and in that time we have been witness to some truly great examples of the comic book genre (X-Men 2, First Class) and some truly forgettable examples of the genre (X-Men 3, X-Men Origins) and in an instance where things seem to have come full circle with the reappearance of the series original helmer Bryan Singer, this latest X-Men falls somewhere in between the others, despite it being arguably at certain times the most entertaining entry into the series to date.With a convoluted story line that even the slightest thought into will display its many flaws, Days of Future Past for the first 90 or so minutes displays an incredible ability to be fun, frenetic, original and engaging with one of the year's best singular scenes taking place in the Pentagon and a whole lot of creative banter taking place between everyone's favourite mutton chop sporting superhero and the younger more sombre Professor X and his loyal sidekick Beast. Time fly's by as the action takes place in the 70's, full of camcorder action, 70's ditties and enough old school fashion to outrival American Hustle, the jaunt back in time really takes X-Men to places we have not yet been and with a fantastic cast, all feels steadily on song to become the quintessential adventure in the series so far but then low and behold like so many before it, this superhero adventure gets lost in its third act.Days of Future Past seemingly went all out to create a 3rd act not content with one time frame but multiple ones, and it becomes a mess of a million different ideas flying about the screen all at once. There's mutants v humans, sentinels vs mutants (in the future!), President Nixon and Tyrion Lannister verse our hero's and a raft of other subplots and ideas to boot. It's a real shame, but the finale to the film feels like a major step down from what had been building before it and it feels less spectacle and more preaching, which in this genre never seems to completely work. While the ending is a huge anticlimax the acting by the large is fantastic with Fassbender and McAvoy in particular continuing on their fine turns and the direction of Singer is often highly inventive, therefore the film feels frequently fresh.This newest entry into the X-Men cannon has been highly regarded by critics and audiences alike and with a large haul at the Box Office the world over it looks likely that many will be waiting Apocalypse's arrival with baited breathe. There is a lot to like in this journey and there are some inspired ideas that sadly culminate in an unsatisfactory and overblown finale. It's hard to agree with all the praise and love given to this film that in the end is nothing more than an enjoyable romp in the universe that is Marvel, but I guess we should all be thankful, it's like those horrible Wolverine movies never happened.3 and a half floating stadiums out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","

"ironhorse_iv","24 May 2014","From all the X-Men story lines that comic fans could see; they finally pick the one that most fans wanted to see. Directed by X-Men movie founder, Bryan Singer; the movie is based on the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline ""Days of Future Past"" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Most fans might remember the 1990's animated cartoon series, that feature this Sentinels storyline, but the movie really did improve of the concept. The only problem is that the movie is trying so hard to tie in all the X-Men film series with this storyline idea that left a lot of plot-holes, missing exposition, and huge changes to certain character's look and history. A lot of hardcore fans will probably rant about that from the unexplained Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) coming back from the death from the events of 2006's X-Men: Last Stand or how the Days of Future Past's 1973's doesn't match up with the 1973's settling of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I like to think that movie is trying to erase both the badly made movies events from history. With any time travel movie, there will be a lot of complex paradoxes. So let's just say this film is one of the many multiverse to save time. Since, it's also a comic book movie, you have to suspense your disbelief really hard to enjoy this movie. So, I wouldn't nitpick the movie so much, but I do have to say, the minor differs between the comic version and the movie version are not that big of a deal. I don't mind the artist license, they took, as much as some die-hard fan of the comics, because I really did find it, entertaining. As the film serve as sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. Much of the continuous story comes from those two movies, but you can see hints of all seven movies in this. This movie marks Hugh Jackman's seventh portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He will be the only actor to appear in the entire X-Men film series. That's insane, how big Wolverine has become. That's what the fans wanted. No wonder, why he took over Kitty Pryce (Ellen Page) place in the story. Without spoiling too much of it, if you haven't readt the comic. In the dystopian future of 2023, sentient robots known as Sentinels are exterminating both mutants and humans. The only way to stop them is for Kitty Pryce to send Wolverine back into time to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing their founder, Bolivar Trask, (Peter Dinklage) that lead to the upgrade the Sentinels needed to take down, the mutants. While, the movie makes Wolverine, the all-time hero, the movie gives as least, some more character arch to others such as young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique, giving them the room to grow. Great acting from all three. The cast for this film is really large, and I think for the most part, they gave enough screen-time for most of the minor characters. Still, I would had love to see Rogue (Anna Paquin) in a bigger role. Also, don't be surprise to find out, that some of the 2011's First Class characters introduce in that film, are now dead and few dead characters from the other movies returns. I think the addition of Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver was fun to watch. I really love his scenes. It's weird that he slated to appear in Disney's 2015: Avengers: Age of Ultron. The legal complexities over the license of the character just odd. Disney Marvel and Fox Studios had resolution to the previous legal issues, which had Quicksilver appear in this film as well as an Avengers sequel, though under certain parameters: no reference to Quicksilver's membership in the Avengers or X-Men can be mention in both films. It gets weirder when the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014 had a scene from this movie, making it look like Sony and Fox would team up, do a Spider-Man/ X-Men crossover. Once again, legal issues prevent that of ever happening. Peter Dinklage seem odd choice for Boliver Trask, due to his dwarfism, but I think its gives a way more self-loathing characteristic to Trask that wasn't there, before. Still, a lot of his scenes do feel weird. At less, pulling him in the film the assassination plot, makes more sense than Senator Kelly. Also makes sure, to check out after the credits for a certain cameo from another X-Men villain. I found the movie makes new Deus ex machine as it goes kinda annoying. One thing, I really did find offending is the outrageous story of the JFK assassination controversy. Not only, wasn't it explore in great detail, it felt like a throw away plot, just to have more action scenes of Magneto escaping the jail cell. Don't get me wrong, I love all the action scenes and found the Sentinels to be a great threat. I just wish the Sentinels were little bigger. I do have to say, the CGI for the most part was great, but the CGI for the 1973's Sentinels were pretty bad. Watch the train scene to understand, what I'm talking about. The soundtrack was epic. The movie was pretty dark for a PG-13 film. It was pretty gruesome at times. Lots of dead bodies, and limps being rip apart. This movie might not be for all children. There is a few surprising nude scenes that the ladies would like. Don't worry, men. Mystique is still look pretty naked in this film. Better than her look in First Class. The language is bit harsh. The humor was funny as hell. Lots of inside jokes, and winks to the comic book fans. Lots of symbolism metaphor messages ranging from civil rights to gay rights that people can debate on. Overall: In my opinion, the best X-Men in the film series so far.","

"anthonymora2","2 June 2014","Talk about a rise and fall and rebirth of a franchise. If you're around my age than the big superhero franchises that we soaked in were the Raimi's Spider-Man films, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and of course the X-Men movies. Overall, I can honestly say that I really love this series. Origins: Wolverine, is certainly a low point and while The Last Stand was no where near the awesomeness and greatness that was Bryan Singer's first 2 films, it's still a fairly entertaining action movie. First Class was (before yesterday) my favorite X-Men movie, and even THE Wolverine was an awesome and gritty and much needed different take on an X-Men story. I literally grew up with this movie franchise, so I guess you can say I was extremely hyped when I sat down in the theater for DOFP.You start off with a Terminator like intro, the first 10 minutes of this movie had some of the strongest and haunting scenes I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Humans AND mutants are on a losing side of a tragic war against the genocidal, Sentinels. A group of X-Men, led by Patrick Stewart's, Prof. X and Ian McKellen's, Magneto. They have a last hope idea of sending someone back to the point in time, where these Sentinel's were created. With his ability to heal and agelessness, Wolverine offers his services to travel back to 1972, to try to reunite the torn friendship between young Magneto and Prof. X, and band together to prevent this horrible war from happening.My god, what a rush this movie was. I don't think I had this sense of wonder watching a comic book movie since The Dark Knight Rises premiered. The eerie opening got me by surprise, but it worked. It perfectly showed us the audience, just how serious and catastrophic this battle with The Sentinels is. So from the start I'm hooked, then we get into this crazy plan hatched up that sends Wolverine to the 70's and get a bit more lighter, but then we see James McAvoy in a terrific performance as young and troubled Charles Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence being as hot and more bad ass than ever as Mystique, and of course Michael Fassbender as the multi-layered Magneto. Everyone's performance in this movie was utilized so good. Oscar winner Halle Berry has minimal dialog, but her presence was felt, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, and Evan Peters all aren't front and center a lot, but they give it their all every minute they're on screen, which makes the dramatic tension so powerful especially when you see certain characters die or get injured. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine as usual, but in a different way, as opposed to past films. Here, Wolverine is a much more centered guy, who really wants to help everyone. He even agrees to think happy thoughts to keep his mind from bursting by traveling through space-time. You would think a movie THIS packed with story, characters, and action, that'd the movie would get lost and tumble over it's own weight and I can't tell you happy I am that it doesn't. You're never once lost as to what's going on, what needs to be done, and how everything got to where it is. The story is played out rather well. Each character and actor has the perfect amount of screen time for what it is their character's are needed for. Quicksilver is a perfect example, he stole every scene he was in, and while he's here and gone pretty swiftly, it gives other more important characters their time to shine. You gotta give it up to the writers and the absolutely terrific direction of Mr. Bryan Singer. Just hearing the X-Men theme song playing during the begging made my eyes tear, this movie really brought the X-Men back to greatness. The special effects were spot on, my favorite scene even outshining the big stadium scene was, Quicksilver's kitchen run. The combination of music, humor, effects, and practical effects worked to summer blockbuster perfection. The design on the Sentinel's were OK, I wasn't blown away by them as they reminded me a lot of the giant robot guard from the first Thor movie. The setting of 1970's Washington makes for some pretty nice looking sets and sequences and the future scenes were awesome. The action is filmed so well and the powers of the mutants make the action just the kind of jaw dropping eye candy I've been wanting. This is one of the best movie I've seen all year, it may have even beaten out Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my favorite comic book movie of the year. The action, acting, and story are exceeded my expectations. I really believe the hype and I see why people are rushing back for another viewing, this is a fantastic movie and I give it my highest recommendation. This movie was a Cineadventure.","

"BrentHankins","21 May 2014","After the disappointing and directionless X3: The Last Stand and the 
 abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prospects for the continuation of the 
 franchise had gone from great to grim in just a few short years. 
 Desperate to breathe life back into the series, 20th Century Fox turned 
 to director Bryan Singer to help right the ship, and although Singer 
 didn't return to the director's chair, he oversaw production of X-Men: 
 First Class, an origin story centered on the friendship between Charles 
 Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) in their 
 early years.
 
 A critical and commercial success, First Class set the stage for an 
 expanded X-Men universe featuring younger versions of the mutant 
 superheroes, but many fans still clamored for more adventures featuring 
 the original cast. With Singer back at the helm, X-Men: Days of Future 
 Past aims to balance precariously between the two, giving the original 
 on screen mutants one last chance to shine, while simultaneously 
 pushing the younger generation forward, and fixing a few glaring 
 continuity errors along the way.
 
 The film opens with a tremendous action sequence in the near future, 
 where an army of mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels have driven the 
 X-Men underground. This sequence of events was set into motion some 50 
 years earlier, when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Bolivar 
 Trask, a military scientist and anti-mutant activist whose experimental 
 Sentinel program would only be accelerated by his untimely demise.
 
 With only a handful of their kind remaining, and their numbers 
 dwindling seemingly by the second, the elder Xavier (Patrick Stewart) 
 and Magneto (Ian McKellan) discover that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has 
 the ability to transport a person's consciousness into their younger 
 self. It's a painful experience, one that Xavier is far too fragile to 
 withstand, but thanks to his innate healing ability, Wolverine (Hugh 
 Jackman) is the perfect candidate to be sent back to alter the events 
 that led to the destruction of the mutant race.
 
 Waking up in his 1973 body, Wolverine is tasked with tracking down and 
 reuniting Xavier and Lensherr to stop the assassination of Trask. Easy 
 enough, right? Unfortunately, Xavier has become a bitter, reclusive 
 alcoholic, wasting away in his mansion with his only remaining friend, 
 Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), while Lensherr is incarcerated in the most 
 secure building in the United States after being implicated in the 
 death of President Kennedy. After all, as Xavier puts it, ""who else 
 could curve a bullet?""
 
 Getting Lensherr out of trouble is a seemingly impossible task, but 
 Wolverine knows a guy. That guy is the young Pietro Maximoff, better 
 known as Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and his handful of scenes are some 
 of the most entertaining moments in the film, particularly an escape 
 sequence that conveys his super-speed abilities by shooting at 3000 
 frames per second. There have been glimpses of this moment during the 
 film's trailers, but the scene as a whole is staggeringly beautiful, 
 and the character's bizarre sense of humor provides a sense of joy and 
 playfulness that are noticeably absent from the rest of the film.
 
 That's not to say X-Men: Days of Future Past is not enjoyable - on the 
 contrary, it's a thrilling experience from start to finish, with plenty 
 of emotional resonance to go along with all the action and special 
 effects. Jackman's performance is less growling menace and more wise 
 mediator, adding yet another dimension to an already complex character. 
 McAvoy and Fassbender still have remarkable chemistry, but the film 
 truly belongs to Lawrence, whose ability to emote through layers of 
 body paint and prosthetics makes Mystique more relatable than ever 
 before.
 
 While it's a shame that most of the original X-Men cast are relegated 
 to cameos, those minor appearances tend to come during jaw-dropping 
 action scenes. The futuristic battles between the Sentinels and the 
 last remaining mutants are a joy to behold, with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) 
 finally using his abilities in ways that fans have always wanted to 
 see, and newcomers like Blink (Fan Bingbing) and Bishop (Omar Sy) 
 getting an opportunity to kick ass alongside the veterans.
 
 There are also plenty of references to the previous X-Men films, as 
 Days of Future Past attempts to bridge the gap between the original 
 trilogy and the reboot. William Stryker (Josh Helman) is a looming 
 presence throughout the film, with his work evoking images of the 
 Weapon X program, and the final moments are full of fan service cameos 
 that effectively close the book on the original characters. For the 
 most part, it succeeds, and while there are still a few questions 
 remaining, there's so much to love here that the minor details no 
 longer feel relevant.
 
 X-Men: Days of Future Past is a return to form for Singer, whose 
 directorial efforts since the first two films have been rather poorly 
 received. His emotional connection to the material and his love for the 
 characters has never been more evident, and the X-Men have never been 
 more compelling or entertaining. This latest installment proves there's 
 still plenty of life left in the franchise, and we can't wait to see 
 what comes next when the mutants return in 2016.

"billygoat1071","23 May 2014","The timeline of the X-Men movie franchise has been troubling ever since the supposedly conclusion of the series, X-Men: The Last Stand. The studio continues to make more of these by telling each of the mutants' origin stories, but it wasn't quite a success due to leading to a grope of making two awful Wolverine movies and a main prequel that doesn't know where to go afterwards. A solution to fix this is simply time-travel. With all the space time continuum and stuff, it finally has the chance to amend the universe and unhappen the unwanted events of the last movies. In that way, X-Men: Days of Future Past triumphs. The movie itself does need to be a little economical in its exposition, but as a blockbuster it is quite a solid entertainment.The plot isn't actually a big of an adventure as it sounds. This fact may blind the audience by the vast amount of references from the past films, astounding action scenes, and extended character work. Take all of that away, you'll just get a breezy little mission that just walks in to historic periods and places. Not saying this is a bad thing; the action scenes are in fact a huge benefit of providing real momentum, and the pathos of the main characters are also worth exploring. It's a real joy just seeing these mutants get back together again. But the weakness here is it's too drawn to nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, it is fun remembering the best parts of the old X-Men, and as a time travel movie, this is absolutely essential, but only few become helpful to the plot. The rest of them is just a fan service which doesn't always elevate the overall story.Then again, the real pleasures are the basic appeal of the series. Most X-Men movies are usually more focused on Wolverine than anyone else, and this sequel might do the same. Surprisingly, it was able to juxtapose each of the major character's arc. The young Professor X and Mystique remain the most intriguing among, the script doesn't always give enough detail to it, but their actors bring the gravity they deserve. The action, once again, is pretty well done. Besides of the future scenes, it provides more than just explosions. There is a real direction going on to these sequences and the camera perfectly shows its every action which makes it totally entertaining.X-Men: Days of Future Past stands as perfect as a fan service. What exactly matters in this installment is to erase what was messed up by the last few movies by taking the concept of time-travel, butterfly effect, etc. The whole film is still too burdened by the past which sometimes hinders the plot, it would have been a much compelling movie if it goes deeper within its intriguing subtext. In the end, the film still succeeds in their goal, and it is a simple one which comic book fans will definitely appreciate. Therefore congratulations, this sequel just saved this franchise's future.","

"michaelRokeefe","14 October 2018","A real delight for dyed-in-the-wool comics fans. The massive cast lends to confusing newbie X-Men fans; but there are enough flashbacks to get you in the thick of things. The X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) into the past with the simple assignment to change history by preventing an event that could lead to a grim future for mutants and humanity. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique, to me, stole the show. For anyone, who lives for super hero and action movies, this is a ""don't miss"".Bryan Singer directs this action packed adventure. Special effects are superior. A star filled cast also features: James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hoult, Peter Dinklage and Patrick Stewart.","

"evanston_dad","21 June 2021","Groovy sequel to ""X Men: First Class"" set about ten years later in the 1970s. Cue self-reverential period costumes, decor, and references (like lava lamps) that keeps the film cheeky. Some cheek is needed as a break from the mopey characters played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. And fans of Hugh Jackman's butt will be pleased to hear that it makes an appearance in this film, as does his hirsute chest (many times), making up for the fact that Wolverine had only a brief cameo in the first film.""X Men: Days of Future Past"" has probably the best special effects yet in the series, so no wonder it received an Oscar nomination in that category. My favorite set piece was probably the one where the mutant kid who can run really fast freezes time and we see him rearrange an action shot mid-frame so that a bunch of bullets that otherwise would have killed our main characters end up missing their targets.Grade: B+","

"mikeymcdo","4 June 2014","I always thought the X-Men were the real deal. When everyone was praising the brilliance of The Avengers I was more preoccupied in the compelling dynamic between the 2 leads, Xavier and Magneto in X-men First Class. Despite loving ""Earths Mightiest Heroes"" the story hasn't got a lot of grit to it and is rather zany. X-Men on the other hand I find to be a lot more compelling especially through it's sub-text of societies prejudice on minorities these are highlighted specifically well in First Class and X2. By taking the principal characters from both these films and bringing them together into a desperate attempt to warn the past of the atrocities of the future in Days of Future Past is a work of genius. Days of Future Past is loaded full of exceptional performances James McAvoy is superb as a young Professor who has lost his way and has withdrawn from offering guidance. Michael Fassbender's performance is magnetic quite literally...but figuratively it is a fascinating portrayal of a man determined to get his way yet still showing respect for his old friend Charles Xavier. This dynamic that has carried on from First Class really fascinates me. Yes the action scenes with the mutant side characters like Blink and Storm are very impressive but the conflicting principals of these 2 characters is the big draw to me.Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian's interpretation of these characters is a much welcome return adding an element of class to the rowdiness of there youthful selves. However I wanted to see more of the desperate survival within the post apocalyptic future. A whole movie could've been done on establishing the bleak future of a world ruled by Sentinels. The big poster characters of these movies Wolverine and Mystique are also great. Wolverine is a bit of a bore in his solo outings. Having him function within a team is infinitely more compelling. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has many poignant scenes with the story hinging on her actions entirely which really raise the stakes. With such an expansive cast all having a chance to shine it is a massive shame that Bryan Singer didn't direct the major let down that was X-Men 3 and Origins. It's nice that the characters act like the events never happened but it's a shame that I can't. As a standalone entry to the series X-Men Days of Future Past has a thoughtful script that doesn't rely on mindless action sequences to keep your attention. Along with it's stellar cast, this is a truly amazing installment to a messy franchise that now has a chance to develop.","

"nerdingsince1996","21 May 2014","simply said it was well directed and well acted with good pacing,great cgi effects and epic soundtrack. what more can you expect from a superhero movie? X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except wolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all star movie with a good director (everything not related to professionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least a decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really surpassed my expectation.I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It already had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by professor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I didn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that annoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very well. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes put me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was appropriate and subtle,just what I like.They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie doesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always about fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always about self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)","

"C22Man","5 June 2016","X-Men: Days of Future Past saw Bryan Singer return to the director's chair for the film series that he helped spark, having something of a mixed legacy since he chose not to direct The Last Stand. Following on from the effortlessly entertaining and swaggering First Class was never going to be an easy feat, especially with director Matthew Vaughn deciding not to return. However, a smart decision was made with Days of Future Past to craft a time-leaping plot with the political and social uncertainty of 1970's United States. Singer's familiarity with the character shines through which leads to an inventive and exciting entry to the series.Story: In an apocalyptic future both humans and mutants are hunted by Sentinels, originally created in the 1970's to hunt mutants. Wolverine is forced to go back in time and prevent the assassination of the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, in order to stop this future from happening. This story works perfectly in both creating a thrilling journey and in merging the old cast with the new. Sending Wolverine into the past to meet the younger Xavier and Magneto creates its own amusing outcomes, but it also allows for loose ends to be tied up. We find out how many of these characters came to be and how they're links to the X-Men were formed. The film also manages to expertly capture the feeling of unrest after the end of the Vietnam War and of the political paranoia found in many 70's thrillers.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is a great lead once again as Wolverine takes centre stage. By this point he has all of the characters intricacies down perfectly and provides plenty of energy as well as humour. James McAvoy is excellent as a much more vulnerable Xavier who struggles to embrace his power and his arc throughout the film is carried off well, while Patrick Stewart makes a welcomed return as the older Xavier.Villains: Michael Fassbender impresses again as Magneto. Showing that the characters conflict began early is a clever move and Fassbender makes his struggle feel so believable. Ian McKellen is also good fun in his return to the role. Peter Dinklage is superb in an understated performance as Trask. Making the character a dwarf is a nice subtle contrast to the mutants, but outside of that Dinklage gives the dialogue weight and provides a reserved intensity that works fantastically.Support: Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique plays a much larger role in the plot here. She being the one who attempts the assassination and the character's DNA being used to craft the Sentinels. Lawrence is simply okay in the role. Nicholas Hoult does standout as Beast, giving the role are geekiness without overdoing it.Action: The action scenes are as slick and stylish as ever before, with the emphasis on the scope of the sequences rather than the physicality. Arguably the highlight scene is breaking Magneto out of the Pentagon. Featuring super speedster Quicksilver, the editing is fantastic and the sheer inventiveness of the scene is a joy to behold. The climax involving the White House is also very creative.Music: John Ottman's score is very Hans Zimmer like. There's a lot of throbbing synths and bombastic brass that can get distracting. That said, his more restrained pieces are very effective and work well as a backdrop to the drama.Production: The visuals in the film are great and Singer shows that he can still make things look classy. As stated, what impressed me the most was that ability to capture the 1970's so effectively, with the film strongly invoking thrillers such as 'Marathon Man' and 'All the President's Men' for its era of paranoia. Switching these social and political issues over to the mutants was handled with grace. The effects were flawless for the most part, with the Sentinels looking unique as well as intimidating and images like Magneto lifting a football stadium looking spectacular. The story and character writings are a strength, with the film doing a really impressive job in explaining all of the motivations behind the characters decisions. I think Mystique lacks mystery, but her struggle between good and evil is played out well. I think the films main flaws lie in comparison to the earlier films in that I think at times it lacks the fluidity of X2 and the enthusiasm of First Class despite its intelligent story-telling.Conclusion: Days of Future Past is another strong entry in the X-Men series, simultaneously developing its universes past whilst building onto its characters futures. There's a great deal fleshed out here and the story never loses focus, which is all the more impressive when you realise just how much is going on. We're at a point now where we really understand these characters and their personalities, so going into the past is actual a good logical choice. There is almost nothing to fault from a technical, action and acting standpoint, while Singer directs as if he's never been away. The film works on both levels, providing an entertaining action trip and for offering some interesting social commentary from that period.","

"claudio_carvalho","21 September 2014","In the future, the mutants and the humans that help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel. Will he succeed in stopping Mystique and the Sentinel Program and save the mutants and their human friends from annihilation? The screenplay of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is confused in the beginning of the story but soon there is the explanation of what is happening. The special effects are top-notch and the excellent cast completes this great adventure of the X-Men. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Dias de um Futuro Esquecido"" (""X-Men: Days of the Forgotten Future"")","

"PennyReviews","1 September 2014","X-men, days of future past takes us into the future, when humans have created robots that they can adapt to mutant powers and destroy them. There for Professor X and Magnito send Wolverine back in time, to worn their young selves and help them prevent the creation of the robots. To be honest, I was a little bit scared by the very bad Wolverine sequel, that I didn't expect the the new x-men would be any good. However, the movie is great. The back and forth in time doesn't confuse the audience, fortunately, and the story doesn't get boring or gets you tired because of the too many action scenes. There are of course some questions that the film leaves unsolved in the end, but I guess we will have to wait for x-men Apocalypse to find out. An other thing that I didn't like, was the scenes that where shoot by a ""vintige"" camera as to show the time of the action, but they where too many, so less of them would have been better. Good performances, well most of them at least and nice costumes, very 70's. So, 7 out of 10, because it is enjoyable and interesting.","

"bthivet","13 May 2014","As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true). Anyway, after seeing it, with 2500 X-Men fan in Paris, I was divided. In fact, I expected something else entirely. There is some plot holes, monotonous parts However, after thought a lot about it, I have to say that is a masterpiece in super heroes' movies. Why? Because it is very different from what we see today, we are not waiting for a finale with explosions, characters just keep moving so the finale do not overdo it but is still very impressive visually. Plus, this movie is very human paradoxically: it speaks about usual mutants themes, but the very point of the movie is can we change, whether it be the past or our vision of the present. The intelligence of the movie is not to focus on changing the past but on writing the present. But the most important thing that makes this movie great is that Bryan Singer loves this franchise and more than making a great blockbuster, he wanted to make a great movie relying on the characters. He was convinced of making the best movie ever and even if it is not the case, I felt it, so despite all is defaults, X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST is a great movie, maybe, one of the best super-hero movies ever made. I advise you to stay till the end of the credits, the scene is just awesome.","

"bandobutt","20 May 2014","Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of most alleged blockbusters.This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any X-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly hit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to behold. The cast-selection is still perfect.Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time.","

"MovieSonic","25 September 2014","My general summary is that this is a 'good' film with lots of action, 'some' great acting and is overall well worth watching.Unfortunately, I can't give this more than a 7 (much as I would like to as I love X-Men) because for me, this was as good/disappointing as the Breaking Bad finale.The good:Obviously the 'real' leads: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Gripping acting from them as per usual. I liked the Sentinels. And Peter Dinklage.That's about it.The bad:I'm not sure there's any point in listing the plot holes and inconsistencies because I'm not very observant so I'm sure people will spot way more than I did and the internet has lots of hilarious pages dedicated to finding the faults. Also, I don't usually care about plot holes but inconsistencies really wind me up because it's so lazy. Decide if you're following the comics or not. If not, make damn sure you follow the events of the previous films. You have to reckon that even if the writers had never heard of X-Men before, 'someone' at some point would have seen the script and gone ""noooo, that can't happen because..."" but no. All the way through this film I was rolling my eyes and groaning and shouting and asking ""HOW??"", ""WHY??"" and the millions of inconsistencies kept taking me out of the film and ruined the experience for me (hence the 7).Jennifer Lawrence. I was never on the bandwagon and I don't hate her either so (that proves?!) this criticism is genuinely an honest opinion: really bad casting. The original Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) moved like a serpent (I mean that in a good way) and had a low sultry voice but Jennifer just looks and sounds like a sulky teenager in most of her scenes. James and Michael are so convincing in part because they nail the accents. Jennifer doesn't even attempt to change her accent or voice. The first time she played Mystique I could overlook it because she was just playing 'the kid version' and wasn't the real Mystique in my eyes but now that she's played her twice, I feel like they want us to think of her as much as being the real Mystique as we do of James and Michael being the real Professor and Eric...but that won't happen until Jennifer drastically improves her acting. She needs to work on her voice and body language.The choreography and costumes: sorry to pick on Jennifer, this is probably wardrobe's fault but maybe the actress requested it? She is blatantly wearing a leotard! Like, 'blatantly'!!! If you're going to play such a proud and distinguished character, you should do it properly and just have the body paint. Isn't she supposed to be naked? i.e. refusing to disguise herself in any way? I've never read the comics but Jennifer's Mystique looks so fake and again, it's distracting. Instead of going for a big name, why not go for an actress who's willing to play the part right?Regarding the choreography throughout the film: There were loads of fight scenes that felt rushed or unfinished or poorly edited...not sure which. Like the sound effects weren't properly added. They weren't always convincing.Why can Kitty Pryde (ridiculous name) send people back in time?? How did the Professor get his body back?? Why is it suddenly acceptable to provide important plot points in DVD commentary? NO, NO, NO! Plot points essential to the development of a story MUST be provided in the film otherwise your film is SH*T!!Tangent: Someone online explained the theory i.e. 'not spoiler' that the Professor got his body back by using the paraplegic's who happened to be his identical twin brother (I don't remember them being identical from the news story in the other film but whatever) and that his twin was in a coma because the Professor's psychic abilities overwhelmed his brother's mind in the womb. Two things wrong with that explanation: 1- The Professor states in this film that he only developed his powers at around 9(ish). A foetus would almost certainly not have reached puberty and would therefore not have been exhibiting any mutant abilities. 2- Even if there was some weird 'developing-foetus glitch' and the Professor did in fact manage to exhibit mutant abilities so powerful it knocked his twin into a coma: 2b- Why has his twin been kept on life support for the last 60 years or so since birth?? 2c- Would that even happen in real life?? 2d- Given that his twin also has to have the exact same abilities otherwise the Professor would now be in a non-mutant body without powers, why would his twin be affected if he has the same genetics and same psychic abilities? I suppose it's possible he just wasn't having a developing-foetus glitch that day like his brother. Unfortunate for him.The point is that if you take over a project and disagree with the death of someone, bring them back in a way that makes sense and also: ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT !!The ending was great on the one hand because of a reason I can't say but disappointing because it reminded me of the happily ever after of Breaking Bad. Also: that's how you could have brought the Professor back. But whatever.If it wasn't for James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, I would have given this a 6. Just FYI.7/10(I have to ask: why couldn't Bobby/Iceman fly them all away on his ice skateboard whilst Logan was off fixing the past? Or at least just Kitty and Logan?)","

"tomgillespie2002","18 October 2014","After Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class (2011) injected a bit of life back into the X-Men franchise, any further instalments faced the headache of what to do with a bunch of fantastic actors playing the same characters decades apart. Inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X- Men comic of the same name, Days of Future Past switches between a nightmarish, dystopian future overrun by giant sentinels, and the boogie nights of the 1970's. We get the best of both worlds, and thankfully, in his seventh appearance over the course of 14 years as his most recognisable character, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine inhabits them both.After narrowly escaping a sentinel attack in the near-future, a band of mutants including the returning Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) meet up with Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Magento (Ian McKellen), Storm (Halle Berry) et al to hatch a plan before the next inevitable attack. Kitty transfers the mind of Wolverine back to 1973, where a young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is soon to assassinate Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), setting off a chain of events that could result in the apocalypse. The only problem is, the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is depressed and mansion-bound, still struggling to deal with his powers and the loss of the use of his legs. They also need to help of Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who is imprisoned in a plastic cell for allegedly assassinating John F. Kennedy.For all it's time-travelling gobbledegook, Days of Future Past doesn't spend too much time trying to explain the mechanics behind it. Like Rian Johnson's mind-bending Looper (2012), it recognises the folly in attempting to spell it out for you. When you look at it under a microscope, time-travel makes little sense in movies as it is, so it's best to accept what you're seeing and move on. McAvoy's Xavier even dismisses Wolverine's ramblings as 'future-s***e'. This frees up more time in an already packed movie to concentrate on the damaged Xavier, brought to life by another fantastic performance from McAvoy. If First Class was Magneto's origins, this is Professor X's, showing a scared, conflicted and broken man and how he became the father to mutants he is when embodied by Patrick Stewart.Of all the many mutants on show, some are not given as much time as their name would suggest. Storm, Anna Paquin's Rogue, and most notably, Ian McKellen's Magneto are somewhat left out to dry, while Nicholas Hoult's Beast, Kitty Pride, and a first appearance for Evan Peters' Quicksilver, are more prominent, and thrive in their larger roles. Trask, a rather fascinating villain thanks to the performance of Dinklage, is left undeveloped. We glimpse into his mind and ambitions, but there's little clarity given to his motivation. But with a film this packed with characters, it would take four hours or more to explore them all, and some inspired set-pieces pepper the film at the points where you start to think the plot will make your head explode. The (possibly) plot-hole laden climax aside, it seems like the franchise is as good as it was at the end of X2 (2003), seemingly serving to delete all the poor decisions made in returning director Bryan Singer's absence. Now, the wait for X-Men: Apocalypse.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"bkrauser-81-311064","25 May 2014","Many things occurred in the year 2000 that changed the way we look at the world. Known as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, the beginning of the millennium saw the first year of Vladimir Putin's reign, the tumultuous election of George W. Bush Jr. and an understated blockbuster by the name of X-Men made its debut. Watching it today, the film can be underwhelming, especially in comparison to its above-the-cut sequel, yet it still holds a special place both in my heart and the emergence and popularity of superhero films.Fast-forward to the year 2014 and the X-Men has become an immensely popular film franchise with a spotty history as far as quality. Taken as a whole, the canon set by Director/Producer Bryan Singer and 20th Century Fox is a prime example of what a comic-book expanded universe can be. Still there were problems including the death of not one, not two but three important characters and the incredibly shoddy treatment of a fan favorite from the Marvel Expanded Universe.Is it safe to say that X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is the greatest mulligan ever made? After all, it's a sequel, its part of an extended canon and universe and with its play on time-travel it's also a reboot. It's also marvelous to boot featuring soundly made special effects, seamless period detail (a large swath of the movie takes place in 1973) and a great plot paying proper lip-service to many of the most popular characters from the comic-books. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Professor X (Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy), Magneto (Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammar/Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), all have their moments to shine.Director Bryan Singer and scribes Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman wisely weave a story that is properly weighty with big stakes and big pay-offs all while being a character centered tale. There is a reverence and respect for the characters as well as a respect of an audience that has been burned by the X-Men movies of the last decade. The Avengers (2012) may have mastered the ensemble superhuman savior shtick but The X-Men are now juggling with fire batons (as well as ice batons, telepathic batons etc.). With the power of a salient, timely and timeless message of inclusion and tolerance this new installment may be the new standard in superhero franchise films. It's certainly the blockbuster to beat in 2014.I have always has an affinity for the X-Men films, comic-books, cartoon series and memorabilia. Unlike many things you love starting at the age of ten, the characters have grown and evolved with me while keeping true to a core message that I still believe and probably will never grow out of. We still do not live in a culture of peace, yet through the stories we tell, maybe we can discover a world where special abilities can mirror our presumed faults and turn them into positivesand of course if the stories become bad we can always tinker a bit.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com","

"tardieu-felix","20 May 2014","Right now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from the X-Men movie I've just seen: The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle. Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting. Visual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it is unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose, whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's development.All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be disappointed, I can tell : you won't be. But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something you'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of the credits...","

"nogodnomasters","26 June 2019","With all the excitement of MIB 3, we get a time travel X-men because they killed off too many people and wanted to get Jennifer Lawrence in a blue body suit by expanding Raven's roll, pun intended. It seems the humans have gained the upper hand and the mutants are on the ""brink of extinction"" which would also kill the franchise, something they attempted with this film. They must stop the humans from getting Raven's DNA which allows them to build better mutant killing machines.Only Logan/Wolverine Man (Hugh Jackman) can go back in time, or at least his mind. Appropriately, he wakes up in 1973 a bit groggy with a lava lamp by his side and Roberta Flack eerily singing ""First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" a song more popular in 1972. Logan must get the team back together and convince them of the mission. Much of the film consisted of springing Magneto, which wittily included another era song by Jim Croce. Unfortunately they ran out of royalty checks and couldn't continue with that fun.The action/comedy/drama was a let down from previous films. While the film maintained the special effects, I felt Jennifer Lawrence's acting talents were wasted, although I predict she will take over as the slow motion/ stop action mode blue skinned princess from that Avatar blue thing.The film had potential, but the script fell short. Still worth watching as a fun popcorn film.Parental Guide: 1 necessary F-bomb. No sex. Jackman shows his butt again.","

"devanshsharma50","9 May 2014","OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again. Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie. Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole movie. Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits together in a wondrous puzzle.So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form. Even the soundtrack is fitting. Happy watching !!!!","

"abouhelier-r","21 May 2014","The X-Men send wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. To me it's a very welcome return to Bryan Singer as X-Men I and II were very good! He really captured the essence of the X-Men comic books which was as it's heart the mutant and humans struggle, politics and emotions of that. Bryan Singer returned this time, taking what Matthew Vaughn brought us with X-Men: First Class and linked the two world together in a perfectly satisfying and epic new film. This exciting summer blockbuster will satisfy fans of the series. Singer is clearly comfortable in this world once again bringing humour to it as well as incredible action. It's in fact great to see the X-Men fight together in a unique and interesting way. Plus, he exceeded people expectations (unfortunately for him though, particularly in this world where expectations are always higher), pleased, surprised and shocked them as well with X-Men I at a time when there were no genre. X-Men II, I think, for many people is a favourite of the entire series. He managed to elevate that again with Days of Future Past. This film is not only an X-Men movie but it's also a time travel movie. Which can go both way. It gives the writers and director the chance to do something that we're not expecting as they could literally pull anything out of the bag. This film might be the best X-Men movie we've ever had as Singer fixed all the mistakes made since his departure with X-Men III and Origins. It's great! However, people tend to smash those big blockbusters because of all the special effects and kids related things but this movie has on display incredible acting talent, the cast is absolutely incredible, such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Plus, the big stands out are Michael Fassbender and especially James McAvoy who is amazing as Professor X in far more difficult times. They have such a fantastic chemistry, we can feel the endless amount of back stories in place within those characters. Yes, there are many characters in this film which is pretty easy to mess up with. We've seen that recently, for instance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which handled his characters terribly. But here, every single one of these characters having really awesome bad ass fight scenes and cool comic book moments, have emotional arcs as well. Undeniably the emotional core of the movie is intact from the beginning. One of the best sequences involved Evan Peters as Quicksilver, trust me as I say that he steels every moments he's on the screen. Every scenes he's in it, not a whole bunch, but still every scene is PERFECT. When he's demonstrating his powers, is actually one of the best scene I have ever seen in a comic book film in my (short) entire life. Finally, only a couple of minor issue including on the one hand little to much silly humour, but I have to admit that it's part of the series. Sometimes humour was extremely clever throughout the movie, characters did jokes and it works. On the other hand there were to little time spent on worthy character such as Dr. Bolivar Trask. Indeed, Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor but he didn't really strike the fear and intensity that I was hoping from him, as we didn't really know what are his motivations to exterminate mutants by creating the Sentinel. The character of Bishop also disappointed me as he doesn't look like the comics in any way. X-Men: Days of Future Past represents a great conclusion as well as a fresh beginning for the next films to come. Overall, even if you're not an X-Men fan despite just the fantasy and spectacle, the story is so deeply human and moving that I feel like everyone has to relate to this franchise. As you could tell by now I'm a huge fan of Marvel universe. I loved X-Men DOFP and of course I'm really looking forward to Apocalypse, more than ever before!","

"joshua-303-92778","5 September 2014","The X-Men franchise has set itself apart, among the gluttonous crop of superhero movies in recent years. After seven films, the characters are very familiar to us, and the latest installment is arguably the best yet, with its predecessor as the only other contender for that title. This is vastly better than the two stand-alone Wolverine films.This movie wastes no time, putting us right in the action from the opening credits. The storyline is complex and frankly doesn't make an enormous amount of sense, but with a modest disbelief suspension makes for an entertaining couple of hours. It's also a decent science-fiction film in its own right.The all-star cast does a satisfactory job. (I'm not really convinced by Jennifer Lawrence, sorry.) It's satisfying to have so many characters, which was a hallmark of the comic book series. We could easily be experiencing this story in the pages of a Marvel mag.The film stumbles a bit when it begins to fall into the blockbuster trap of trying to pack in too many spectacular scenes. On the other hand, the musical score is far less obnoxious than we've been hearing in other recent Hollywood movies.I was surprised to learn this was directed by the same person who helmed ""Superman Returns"". I thought that film was a disaster. So he seems to have evolved in his artistic skill.These new X-Men movies demonstrate how to convincingly make prequels, in contrast to some other blockbuster franchises. One wonders why they gave the coveted Star Wars sequel to JJ Abrams when there are clearly better directors in the business.","

"quincytheodore","23 May 2014","An all-star ensemble delivers one of the better and more captivating superhero movie in recent time, despite the use of a rather mystifying time travel plot. They do a remarkable job of keeping the audience invested to the characters, each with brimming personality to ensure there's never a dull moment. Visually, the movie is captivating, its contrast tone bridges the colorful 70s and severely bleak future impeccably. It also appropriately utilizes good humor throughout the seemingly melancholy plot.X-Men: Days of Future Past is an ambitious movie, it brings the newer cast from First Class as well as the older trilogy, plus Hugh Jackman. The time traveling gimmick could be a puzzling one, and in some occasions there are tricky twists that rely on heavy expositions. However, the movie pulls it off quite neatly with balanced pacing. The complexity doesn't divert the focus away from relationship of characters, most of which are always in peril. Many of the cast are capable to lead a movie by their own, but the movie doesn't feel bloated because they are so many involved. Director Bryan Singer cleverly seams the characters' tales together; the present chemistry produces engaging interaction between them.The bulk of the story occurs in 1973, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence take most of the spotlight. They perform admirably, each showcasing emotional baggage and entwined history together. Hugh Jackman fits into the party fairly well, he has been Wolverine for so long, he just naturally meshes together with the younger X-Men. Peter Dinklage provides a unique antagonist. X-Men movies are notoriously filled with military men as villains, it's nice to see someone more dynamic and with less reliance to violence.Effects are done beautifully. The future battles are spectacular, not to mention the choreography gracefully combines the mutants' power into the fray. I personally like the intricacy of Blink's ability which allows her to use multiple portals. Her scenes are few, but very well done. The slow motion effect looks wonderful and melee combat is performed effectively, especially Mystique's acrobatic dances. There's lingering retro ambiance for 70s, a simple touch of familiarity. One minor blemish is the lighting for future setting might be a tad too dark at times to fully appreciate the graphic.The prevalent flaw of time travel gimmick is the impact actions supposedly have on the future, this movie is no exception. There are a few instances where characters act rather brashly just in case it may hopefully change the future, a couple decisions are questionable as well, it's hard to believe experienced mutants with special powers would do impulsive action. It also tries to add prejudice theme, but seeing Jennifer Lawrence, even with blue skin, having self-confident issue is like seeing a supermodel complaining she's fat. All the flaws are just little hindrance, they barely affect the gripping performance of the talents.X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably the best of the franchise, it will entertain viewers with exquisite acting, finely pace story and delightfully likable characters.","

"prospectus_capricornium","22 May 2014","Showcasing the biggest assembly of Marvel's mutants ever, 'Days of Future Past' claws its way on top of the X-Men franchise.Sensing the brink of extinction, Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) unite together in an attempt to save their species from the Sentinels. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time to stop Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), now called Mystique, from killing anti-mutant scientist Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Logan has to convince both the younger Magneto and Charles to stop Mystique before she gets captured and studied, which in turn would give way to the creation of Sentinels.While, there is so much incoherence in how the time travel aspect of the plot is presented, this must still be Bryan Singer's best X-Men film. The greatest strength of this movie lays on how it pays so much more attention to its story and script than the visual spectacle it can surely serve. Surprisingly, the movie vaunts some funny and light moments particularly those with Quicksilver (Evan Peter). Quicksilver has enjoyed highlight in this film as his section is streaked with laugh-rendering wit and humor. Jennifer's role is arguably one of the central if not the most vital in the movie. Hugh Jackman's take remains the same, but somehow feels fresh. Michael Fassbender's Magneto and James McAvoy's Professor X are satisfying than their old counterparts, which, by the way, is not surprising, as the rest of the cast are actually just story pawns.'Days of Future Past' is a bold take to raise the X-Men franchise into another level. It toying with history is ambitious, suspenseful and confusing, but it nonetheless manages to escalate itself to a higher ground. A surging epic and a gripping tale that seems not to loosen its hold on the audiences, 'Days of A Future Past' must be X-Men's biggest installment to date.","

"DarthVoorhees","8 January 2015","'X-Men: Day's of Future Past' has a great deal of potential. It's the first comic book film in a long while that feels as close as one of these films can to being a fully realized story with convictions and characters. This is no small feet at all. There could very well be a four star film in the DNA of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. It has brave ideas about destiny and it tackles them in smart ways that are deeper than most other comic book films. The problem with this film is that it exists in the same climate that has given us 'The Avengers'. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' should exist as it's own entity because it would strengthen the film and it's message. Unfortunately I feel that like it's equally excellent predecessor 'X-Men: First Class' that this film can't quite reach greatness because of the confines of a franchise. Ideas inevitability fall second fiddle to action figure characters, video game dialogue in the action scenes, and worst of all the need to make endless sequels...'X-Men' has the benefit of longevity and it really can be a benefit. One great thing about this film is that it knows we already have solid relationships with these characters by this point in the series and it doesn't need to introduce us to them again. This is a great relief. What it does need to do though is do new things with the characters. I think some slack is given to these 'X-Men' films because they have such perfect casts. Maybe it is merely a matter of prejudice but I am drawn to Magneto the most and I felt this film is one of the worst in getting the essence of this character correctly out of all the 'X-Men' films. I love 'First Class' in that it took the time to really explore the friendship of Charles and Magneto but because of sequelitis these two had to have their lines drawn in the sand by the end of the film. I wish we could have visited Magneto with a fresher take and explore some of the intricacies of his personality. Sequelitis doesn't let us do this however. Magneto has to be a villain capable of holding up a tent pole franchise. It doesn't give the audiences or Michael Fassbender credit. And I have no complaints about Fassbender, he's brilliant but the character needs work in this script. I felt it didn't do anything new with the characters. I thought the choices in the script really made Magneto look really stupid. I like the fact that the film doesn't follow the crappy tropes used in time travel films but Magneto doesn't listen to the warning of the future even though he believes it. I hate the fact that as soon as Magneto enters the peace conference that he starts up a huge ruckus that gives Trask exactly what he wants to get government support for the sentinel program. Magneto has always had this anger but it's been a righteous anger. He isn't someone who goes out and throws all his cards on the table as he does in this filmI find that like in my review of 'First Class' I have to put a lot of criticism into my discussion of the ending. The last two X-Men films have been good until the endings where they need to hint a sequel with a wink in the eye. Doesn't the movie not work at all if you don't have either Magneto or Mystique there at the school when Logan wakes up in the present? The whole point of the movie is that people are not shackled to destinies that cannot be avoided. We are supposed to have faith in these characters that they could be redeemed and choose a more righteous path. In the end by their omission from that final scene we are lead to believe that they don't make the right choice presumably so you could have them back as villains in a sequel. And then we find out that this movie which was supposed to be about redemption is just another comic book film about nothing but making sequels.These seem like rough criticisms and to be fair they are. They are big detriments to this film. However like 'First Class' what the film gets right it excels at. The acting is all top notch even with the characters with lackluster motivations. The films' strong central concept of destiny is so brilliantly dealt with that I feel cheated with this ending. This may be why I love 'X-Men' because they are so much about themes and ideas. I get the feeling though that some at Fox don't think we are smart enough to be trusted with ending those ideas on their natural conclusion.","

"paul_haakonsen","5 September 2014","OK, I have to admit that I am impressed. I am not overly keen on superhero movies, and the previous X-Men movies have been adequate entertainment, sure, but ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" really put all previous X-Men movies to shame.The storyline here is really well thought through and executed equally well. And whereas the previous movies have been entertaining, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" also gives the audience something to think about. This installment to the series is more than just another action movie, it actually challenges the audience.As with the previous movies, the cast is impressive, and people are still doing great jobs with their given roles and characters, and that really shows on the screen. Each character did bring something unique to the story and the movie, of course some more than others, especially those around which the story was centered.I liked the concept idea of having to go back in time to change the future. Granted, there is nothing new in that idea by far, but it was done in a nice way in the movie, and it did start some thoughts. I started to think 'so if they go back in time to change history, what about the events that transpired in all the previous movies?'. But after a bit more thought, then it dawned on me that it was actually genius, because that would mean that the events that happened in the previous movies were all byproducts of the change in history, and what was shown in those movies differed from what actually should have been show. So in that sense, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" does give the audience something to think about.As for the effects, well it was as with all previous X-Men movies, great and up to date. Lots of really great CGI effects and some great display of interesting mutant abilities. And while Blink did have some interesting power, I couldn't help but notice that somewhere along the line someone had played a bit too much ""Portal"".Anyway, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a really entertaining movie and it does justice to all the previous X-Men movies. This particular movie is by far the best in the series so far, and I can highly recommend it, even if you, like me, are not too fond of superheroes.","

"BA_Harrison","28 May 2014","Having been suitably impressed by the trailers, I really wanted to check this one out on the big screen before it went to DVD, but was slightly concerned by the fact that I had yet to see X-Men: First Class. I needn't have worried: although many of the events in this latest adventure do refer to the previous movie, for the most part I found it fairly easy to fill in the blanks for myself, and am happy to report that I had an absolute blast with what has got to be one of the finest superhero films ever made.An excellent cast, mind-blowing special effects, amazing direction by Bryan Singer, a fun time-twisting plot, Jennifer Lawrence in the buff (well, covered in blue paint and a few scales, but that's good enough for me!), the secret behind the assassination of JFK: X-Men: Days of Future Past is pure entertainment from start to spectacular finish. The 131 minutes just fly by.Although the basic plot mightn't be considered all that fresh—it's the old 'change the past to alter the future' scenario—the whole thing is so beautifully written and skilfully executed that any lack of originality is easily forgiven. The entire cast do an excellent job, with special props going out to Peter Dinklage for his awesome Anchorman style hair-do and 'tache, and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who provides the film with its most enjoyable moment, using his incredible lightning speed to save the other mutants whilst taking down an entire team of armed special agents.","

"alekspredator87","19 September 2022","The ""First Class"" has become an undoubted leap into modernity. The picture showed itself perfectly, demonstrating a fresh look at the trilogy about People from the 2000s. It was interesting to see the continuation of the large-scale comic thriller of 2011, the name of which sounds great ""Days of the past future"". Undoubtedly, I wanted to see the continuation of the history of the formation of Magneto and Professor X, but we must pay tribute to the creators - they competently lured the audience by attracting Hugh Jackman and his Wolverine to the project, as well as the heroes who were once performed by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. In addition to them, other familiar characters appeared in the picture.The film undertook to show one of the most interesting stories where the superiority of mutants was nullified when humanity took seriously to deal with people with superpowers. The Guardian robots were incredibly dangerous and practically invincible. The picture already at the very beginning shows how strong and ferocious these machines are. The creatures of human hands, the Guards kill in cold blood any mutant that gets in their way. And these silent killers really terrify, suddenly in the mind of the viewer radically changing the balance of forces in the confrontation. There is only one salvation - a journey into the past, and only Wolverine can make it.The story is rich. It is in no way inferior in scale to the powerful ""First Class"", and in terms of the number of characters and stars on the screen, it undoubtedly surpasses the previous superhero team film. The story is strong, it combines strong drama and a lot of adventures, for which the audience loves this franchise. The director was again Bryan Singer, who gave us the original dilogy of 2000 and 2003. His hand is felt in this project absolutely. The story is large-scale, it is deeply personal and incredibly watchable.The calculation was a win-win. The creators combine two storylines, where both classic characters and actors performing them appear, as well as new performers whom the audience saw in the 2011 film. At the same time, the stories perfectly echo, they allow you not to get confused in what is happening on the screen, and Logan, performed by Hugh Jackman, looks like an excellent kind of glue of this work. The opening of the film was Evan Peters, who gave the world Mercury. This is a charismatic character who, even in the short minutes of his screen time, was able to make the audience fall in love with him, promising an interesting story of this mutant in the future.The film has a deep script. The creators did a great job, turning the plot not just into an attraction with special effects and fierce battles, but creating a truly deep story, where the main place is given to the drama, the inner world of the characters, of which there are quite a lot on the screen. Despite the abundance of characters, the viewer will be quite able to feel the experiences of this or that hero, plunging into their stories.There are really a lot of characters. Many of them are already well known to the audience and will appear on the screen in a limited time frame so that the audience remembers them and rejoices at their appearance. Other protagonists will be revealed more thoroughly. For example, Wolverine has already had so much screen time in past films, both general and his personal, that you seem to know everything about him. However, Jackman presents his Logan in such a multifaceted way that you don't get tired of watching the hero, and his life is still interesting to the viewer. The young versions of the beloved and well-known Charles Xavier and Eric Lansher are also perfectly revealed. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender perfectly play their roles, making the characters even more interesting. Other performers are also good, among whom I would single out Nicholas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, as well as franchise veterans: Halle Berry, Sean Ashmore, Anna Paquin and Elliot Page.The picture is inspiring. Its scale, its drama, its history. ""Days of the Past Future"" is created with respect to all the characters and the history of mutants in general. The film successfully connects the past and the present of history, predicting an interesting continuation of the adventures of mutants.10 out of 10.","

"Chalice_Of_Evil","22 May 2014","The film's beginning includes a Professor X voiceover and the opening credits sequence/theme like we've come to expect (which were all absent in First Class), as we're dropped into the middle of this post-apocalyptic grim/dark future (with bright neon lights!) Xavier describes, where mutants are far fewer than they were and this has led to a surprising team-up between Xavier/Magneto (it's good to see Patrick Stewart/Ian McKellen together again onscreen) along with familiar characters Wolverine, Storm (could her hair BE any shorter?), Iceman, Kitty Pryde, Colossus...and a bunch of new mutants we don't know/care about who serve as cannon fodder (though Iceman gets the nastiest demise). However, it's a total ""Psyche!"" moment, as Kitty (once again showing off her delightfully amusing potty-mouth) soon reveals this was them warning their future selves. In this bleak future, Sentinels (which now resemble the Destroyer from 2011's Thor) possess Mystique's ability to change/adapt, giving them the various mutants' powers (which they turn on them/kill them with).They gained her power because past Mystique assassinated Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who was experimenting on mutants, and she got captured/her blood was used. Xavier tasks Kitty (now possessing the unexplained power to send someone's mind back in time to their past self's body) with sending Wolverine (whose mind, which heals, is the only one that can handle such a distant/prolonged trip) back to prevent the assassination/creation of this unbeatable enemy. The 70's setting provides some good humour (lava lamps! Water beds! Logan's butt! No internet! Okay, *one* of those mightn't be 70's-specific), as Future-Logan's-mind-in-Past-Logan's-body has to navigate unfamiliar territory. He's surprised to find Charles (James McAvoy) walking and Hank (Nicholas Hoult) a non-hairy-Beast. Turns out they're using an unmentioned-until-now serum that suppresses their mutations (where was this when Rogue wanted to be able to touch people without putting them in a coma, HMM?).After Logan has essentially the same thing he said to Charles during his First Class cameo thrown back in his face, it takes some convincing to get this now-shaggy-haired/bearded young Xavier to help out. Eventually he does, but they require the services of Michael Fassbender's Magneto...who's in prison for killing Kennedy (though he later reveals to Charles he was trying to SAVE him...because he was a mutant), so Logan seeks the help of Evan Peters' Peter/Quicksilver (who's treated like he's an old friend we should *know*). While most apparently think of the slow-mo sequence showing off Quicksilver's super-speed as a film highlight, my 'unpopular opinion' is I prefer the MCU version, as this one's powers are mainly just an excuse to show him pranking folks in between saving people. I'm much more interested in seeing J-Law's Raven/Mystique FINALLY kicking major butt (like Rebecca Romijn's version always did), since we got NONE of that during First Class.Raven's now much more bitter, her 'friends' (ie. Magneto's lame/forgettable crew from First Class) are dead after having been experimented on and she's determined to put a bullet in Trask...except Magneto winds up putting a bullet in *her* (well, her leg) in a nifty display of his powers (whilst all this is happening, Logan momentarily loses his future self's consciousness and he freaks out, not knowing where he is/WTF Beast is after Hank changes back to a furball. Thankfully, Hoult's Beast makeup/prosthetics is somewhat-improved), and once again Erik's inadvertently responsible for screwing things up (first paralysing Charles, now spilling Raven's blood that's used for Sentinels). McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence and Hoult all firmly established the different dynamics between their characters in their previous film, and I enjoyed their interaction with each other (as well as Jackman's Logan) the most in this film. The new characters introduced? Not-so-much.Although it's nice seeing Ellen Page/Shawn Ashmore get to play more prominent/important roles as Kitty/Bobby than they did previously (plus, we *finally* see Iceman do his signature comic-book 'ice-surfing' move), it sucks for Rogue that those two are together after she she took the cure to be with Bobby. However, 'The Rogue Cut' shows she *still* somehow has her absorption power, and after Kitty's inadvertently hurt by Wolverine when he lashes out (he has a habit of doing this, as Rogue can attest after him doing the same thing to her in the first film) as his mind's short-circuiting, Bobby FINALLY remembers his ex-girlfriend. He's apparently known ALL THIS TIME she's being held in Cerebro at the old X-Mansion, but previous rescue attempts failed/were abandoned because of...tight security (really? You have SUPER-POWERS. *Nothing* should be 'impenetrable' for you!). Evidently, Bobby sucks.Iceman, Magneto and Xavier (who actually gets to *do* something instead of being taken out of commission/sidelined/vaporised) rescue Rogue, and she's briefly reunited with her jerky ex...just in time for him to DIE AGAIN (at least it's while protecting/saving her, so he's not completely useless). Obviously, Kitty doesn't take this news well (a shame that Ellen Page's best acting was exorcised from the theatrical version) and Rogue 'borrows' her power, using it to keep Logan's mind in the past. There's other less significant stuff added back in, some helps explain certain things, but what I really appreciated were all the little 'character moments' sprinkled throughout, which I thought added something extra to the film, fleshing out some character relationships/dynamics. 'The Rogue Cut' feels like a more 'complete' film. While the movies always did her character dirty, I still appreciated the bond between Anna Paquin's Marie/Rogue and Jackman's Logan/Wolverine, so I was thankful to see them together again (even if he was unconscious for it).While I really enjoyed First Class, Bryan Singer's return helped make this film what it was. He handles the action (the 'stadium levitation' sequence especially) and the time-travel shenanigans well, 'righting' the many 'wrongs' of The Last Stand with this film's ending (which is the only place we see Rogue in the theatrical version), the Jean/Scott cameos (plus Kelsey Grammer's Beast) were genuine surprises and, honestly, since it's all downhill from here...probably best to just pretend this movie's the TRUE ending for this iteration of the X-Men.","

"hypestyle","31 May 2014","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the latest film in 20th Century Fox's enduring franchise based on the Marvel Comics team of superheroes. The plot hinges on the team's main tough guy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, fresh off last year's solo outing as the character) being sent back in time to stop robots from taking over the world. An assortment of X-Men movie alumni make calculated appearances throughout the era-spanning film.The film begins in a dystopian future, where security robots called Sentinels have gone rogue and laid waste to much of human society and the mutant population alike. As a voice-over from the film's trailer proclaims, ""They started out targeting mutants then they started targeting everybody."" The status of most world governments is unclear but apparently the Sentinels have a global mandate, as what remains of the X-Men have become nomadic renegades. Even longtime mutant-rights rival Magneto (Ian McKellen) is now a de facto member. The ragtag outfit (including Halle Berry as weather-mistress Storm) travels the world, searching for a way to stop the Sentinels while trying to avoid capture or execution. The latest incarnation of the killing machines have the ability to create perfect counter-measures for most attacks, so even the mutants' considerable powers are frequently stymied in combat. Article Photo Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, center) must bridge the chasm between Xavier (James McAvoy, left) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender, right) in order to save the future in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" A strangely resurrected Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, whose character was killed in X-Men: The Last Stand) returns as the moral leader of the team. He's strategized a Hail-Mary stunt to hopefully end the genocide and stop the Sentinels once and for all. His idea? Just have Wolverine time-travel 40 years into the past and stop the assassination of a key political figure. The powers of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) help send Wolverine's mind back into his 1973 body. (Wolverine looks the same as before, thanks to his longevity powers—but his claws aren't yet fused with a steel alloy, so he's only slightly less dangerous to tick off.) But even when abetted by mutant powers, things are never as easy as planned. In the past, younger Xavier (James McAvoy) has abandoned running his boarding school for mutant children. Having retreated into alcohol, he spends most days un-sober and embittered about the creeping social animosity toward mutants. Meanwhile, the younger Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is imprisoned hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon.The would-be assassin that Wolverine is tasked to stop is Raven, a.k.a. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose shape-shifting allows her to imitate anyone. She's gradually working her way to getting rid of scientist Bolivar Trask (Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage). Convinced that mutants are an invasive species, Trask's military-hardware company builds the Sentinels as the answer to containing ""the mutant problem."" The grand unveiling of the Sentinels is planned to take place in the midst of Vietnam War peace talks. As such, even President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) is brought into the plot.Only Nixon could go to China, and thus only the brawler Wolverine could be sent to play peacemaker between the estranged Xavier and Magneto as the dawn of the Sentinels nears. The plot is punctuated by yet another threat in Major William Stryker (Josh Helman), an army scientist using mutants as guinea pigs.Taking into account the vast ensemble cast, Jackman, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence get the most screen time and director Bryan Singer manages to get substantive mileage out of their respective performances. Audiences will believe in the alternating mutual bitterness and empathy between Charles, Magneto and Raven's highly dysfunctional— and volatile — surrogate family, with Jackman's Logan and Nicholas Hoult's Hank as harried (and hairy) caretakers. The future X-Men have a smaller role to play here compared to their 70s counterparts, but the fight sequences with the Sentinels are top notch. New characters Quicksilver (Evan Peters in a very memorable turn) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), in particular, have some nifty visual tricks.Perhaps inadvertently, the filmmakers (including director Singer and co-writer Simon Kinberg) manage to tap into contemporary concerns about drone-driven surveillance and warfare. Also of note is that the future X-Men team essentially takes on the role of terrorists—from the robots' point of view, anyway. The comics' pop-allegory about social tolerance (or the lack thereof) is somewhat obscured by dizzying fight scenes and laser bursts, but Days of Future Past is still a highly competent action fantasy.","

"sorednax3","24 May 2014","I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don't actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we're supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there's Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan's sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn't need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you'd think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. I'd like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that's right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It's supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn't he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it's 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots? I get how putting metal in them while they were being shipped allowed Magneto to use his mutant power on them, but doesn't explain how he was able to reprogram them. He talks and they obey him, makes no sense....ahhhhh shut up and eat your popcorn. Ohhh, one last thing: Dear studio execs, please consider your largest demographic when choosing which characters bare butt to show off.","

"Aaron1375","9 June 2014","I am one of the few people out there that apparently enjoyed X-men: The Last Stand. I thought the film had the best battle scene of the original trilogy as it actually had the first real team battle instead of being Wolverine versus various mutants and people. I had heard that this one was going to wipe away that film, but in reality, this film pretty much wipes all those films away, but does so in a bit more imaginative fashion. Like a reboot, but not in a way. We get the cast of the old films and the ones from First Class in a time travel story that works for the most part.The story has the mutants in a desperate situation as Sentinels have been created to cleanse the Earth of all existing mutants. We witness, right away, the terror they can inflict as they wipe out some of the toughest mutants around with ease. This Sentinels adapt to their targets and are able to inflict great damage. Well after this group of mutants is wiped out, we see them alive and well as one of the mutants, Shadowcat, can now send a person back into their former self and that person then warns of the impending Sentinel attack and they then abandon their hiding spot and find a new location. Professor Xavier and Magneto are now on the same side and Professor X has a plan to send his consciousness back into his former self to the time the Sentinel program took off and stop Mystique from killing a man by the name of Trask as this leads to her capture and her ability to morph leads to the super adaptable Sentinels. Unfortunately, Professor X can not survive the time jump, but Wolverine can. He makes his way into the past and must convince not only Professor Xavier, but also Magneto that they must stop Mystique and thus stop the horrific future.The story was pretty good and I liked that Beast played a huge role in this film. I also enjoyed Quicksilver's time in the movie. Still, the emphasis is on Wolverine, young Professor Xavier and young Magneto. Granted, the best action takes place in the future as the Sentinels once again locate the remaining mutants hiding place. They did a lot of good things here, but I am a bit perplexed as to why they insist on making Mystique such a huge part of these movies. I can understand Wolverine, as he was everybody's favorite and he was in the comics a whole lot, but when I collected comics heavily for three years I literally did not have but maybe two comics with Mystique in it. One a back issue featuring Cable's first appearance and another an annual that had a couple of short stories detailing the downfall of her group Freedom Force. While perplexed, it did provide for an interesting story and so I guess I will roll with it even though I find it highly unfair that the females who saw this got to see Wolverine's bare buttocks while all us guys get is a smurf with all the best parts distorted.In the end, I really enjoyed this X-men film more than I thought I would and I am also very excited about the next film that will finally feature another X-men villain that should have been featured before now considering the amount of X-men movies there are now. The film did have some strange moments and there were some off screen deaths that were a bit puzzling and I did not care for, but overall the film had some nice action and an interesting enough storyline to keep it all together and not seem like a film where they were simply trying to shove every mutant possible into the film just because they could.","

"moonmonday","12 June 2014","As if the third film in the original X-Men trilogy weren't execrable enough, this one takes the only decent X-film -- First Class -- and casually murders the popular cast of characters, which is referred to obliquely in the film's first hour. This is done to motivate Magneto, since of course he's never experienced the death of anyone dear to him before. It's not like he lived through the Holocaust or anything.Never once is anything explained, most notably how a dwarf with absolutely no powers but wooden acting managed to capture and murder them in the first place. And of course, that character must not die, at all costs. Because we really want to save this hideous abomination of a timeline?The story is ludicrous, even for a superhero film, and it's acted and delivered about as poorly as one might expect. It's impossible to invest oneself in, and even the attempt at historical trappings are pathetic. Either they're shoehorned 'hey-it's-the-se-ven-ties!' references (which tend to be anachronistic anyway) or they're half-arsed, and that's being generous.If you liked any of the X-Men films, and especially if you liked First Class, steer far away from this. It doesn't make any sense (Xavier can walk but can't use his powers becaaaause of the same serum that turns Hank McCoy into a blue Beast?) and doesn't respect its audience (Pietro is reimagined as 'Peter' and is about as annoying as you could imagine), but more than that, it doesn't respect the source material in the comics or the previous films.This film does 3D well. That is its only positive. It has the distinction of being the first and only film I have not been able to finish in the theatre, for which I walked out and demanded a refund.If you are a fan of the X-Men, do not see this movie. If you are a fan of the comics, do not see this movie. If you liked the previous films, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.This may sound like hyperbole, but it's not. I have sat through patently terrible films, but they also were films without huge budgets and actors who should know better, not to mention directors who really need to hang it up. If this was the best they could do...it's time to just stop.","

"KineticSeoul","29 June 2014","I thought this was going to be the most action packed X-Men movie so far. With LOTS of special effects and superpowers...I was wrong. However this has the most emotionally moving story in the X-Men movie franchise so far. It delves into humanity, subconscious, emotions, hope and destiny. There is actually quite a bit of memorable moments in this movie, mainly because of the depth and development. The plot is a bit complex for me to thoroughly explain, but it's about Wolverine going back to the 1973 in order the save the mutants in the future. From sentinels that can copy and adapt other mutants powers that are used against them. Which they got the advancement from Mystique's DNA. However shouldn't it be Rogue's power? It would have been cool to see the mutants actually have a chance against the sentinels. Anyways Wolverine is once again the main main main character who goes back in time to guide the younger Professor Xavier. Kind of like how Xavier guided Wolverine. The movie is called X-Men but the story mostly focuses in on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique. You do see the other mutants use their powers, but it doesn't play the main key parts into this movie. My main complaint with Wolverine in this, is the fact that he doesn't have his Adamantium claws so you won't really see him tearing crap up. This movie let's say is a refreshing start to a new beginning...Maybe. My favorite part in this movie is the Quicksilver scene in the kitchen. If people actually decide to make a Flash movie, maybe the budget won't be in the TV show. So when it comes to the Flash movie, I hope it can up the coolness from that scene. Overall this is my favorite X-Men movie so far even surpassing the second installment. It really is worth checking out.8.5/10","

"grantss","20 April 2015","An entertaining movie, though it got fairly silly and plot-hole- ridden towards the end.Started very well, with a time travel piece that explained some of the past history of the characters. Also had a fair amount of intrigue, especially due to the changing of history angle.The movie managed to maintain focus and keep the plot tight, until about halfway through. Then, slowly but surely, the cracks began to appear. People behave in random ways, things happen that make no sense, and it all seems that these are just plot devices to prolong the movie.The final confrontation makes very little sense at all, and neither do the effects of it.However, great CGI, obviously, and solid performances all round.","

"cattjones","24 May 2014","I want to start off by saying that my brother, Nick predicted this movie after the 2nd X-Men film. He is a true comic book geek and saw this coming. I am sure that he is not the only one. I was more of a bi-polar comic geek. I read Archie and Richie Rich on good days and Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside on bad days. I read super hero comics sporadically. My brother informed me that Quicksilver (Evan Peter) is Magneto's son. I had no clue. Speaking of Quicksilver, he was my favorite character in this film. When assigned a task, I never had a concern that he would not complete it. Apparently he will make another appearance in the next film. Once again I neglected to stay through the credits and missed some important information. Nick informs me that it has something to do with the apocalypse. I really need to start staying through the credits of not only Marvel films, but also DC Comic films. Anyway, I was really glad to see the original X-men join forces with their younger selves. They even found a way to include Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman). I was glad to see Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) as the person with the power to make going back to the past possible, but for some reason I was getting flashbacks to the film Inception. Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) has his mind set on creating Cyborgs that would identify mutants and destroy them and it is the X-Men's goal to travel to the past and to keep the present future from happening. I would be remised if I did not mention Mark Camacho (President Nixon). Not only did he do a great interpretation of the president, but the whole recreation of the 70s was done extremely well. There were glimpses of every X-Men film to date incorporated in this film and the writers did an excellent job tying them all together. This is one of those films that you really do not have to advertise. Most people are so engaged with the X-Men, that it would be almost criminal not to see the franchise through. I thoroughly enjoyed the film because (1) it was not too long and (2) there weren't any dull spots. This is definitely a film worth seeing, especially if you want to be ready for the next one.","

"dee.reid","3 June 2014","Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the 2014, Bryan Singer-directed ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is that it is a near-perfect melding of past and present, much like its source material. Personally, I've long considered the best ""X-Men"" movies to have always been under Singer's direction (i.e., 2003's ""X2"" - the best ""X-Men"" film there ever was). As an openly gay Jew who was raised in a mostly Christian community growing up, Singer knew what it was like to be an outsider, which is why, it can be said, that the best ""X-Men"" movies belong to him and do contain a slight personal touch.I've admired the X-Men pretty much since the time I first got into comics and superheroes. They are my favorite superhero team, without question. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby first launched the title for Marvel Comics in 1963 as a way of voicing their feelings about racism in American society, and over the years other artists and writers have used the title as a platform to voice similar concerns about racial hatred, homophobia, anti-Semitism, religion and religious fundamentalism, and any & all other forms of hatred and intolerance.""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is adapted from the famous two-part comic book story arc of the same name (""The Uncanny X-Men #141-142"" - both of which I do own) by long-time ""X-Men"" writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne. Like the original story arc that inspired it, the film features old and new, meaning old characters (from Singer's first ""X-Men"" film series) and new ones (the new series that began with 2011's ""X-Men: First Class""). The story is greatly different from the comics, but the basic premise is still the same: in a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and either killed out-right or imprisoned in internment camps, Professor Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) uses his powers to send someone - Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat in the original comics, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) here - back in time and avert the disaster that will turn humankind against the world's mutant population and lead to an eventual mutant holocaust.I'm going to stop there. The movie is quite thrilling and occasionally very frightening. The best thing that can be said about the picture is the fact that Bryan Singer is back on-board the film series he helped to create and bears his signature. The movie is a spectacle and can be pretty funny in some spots, i.e., the early scenes set in 1973 with the teenage mutant speedster Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver (""American Horror Story's"" Evan Peters), and the younger, disenchanted Professor X (James McAvoy). And the way that it re-writes history to suit its vision is very creative (the JFK assassination, anyone?); special credit should be given to screenwriter Simon Kinberg in that regard. Oh yeah, and the fearsome Sentinels finally make their screen debut after all these years.So far, this is the second-best ""X-Men"" movie I've seen. The return of Bryan Singer was very welcomed by this long-time X-Men fan. If the film's ending is any indication, I can't wait for this film's follow-up in a few years (""Age of Apocalypse"" is what I've heard).9/10","

"adamscastlevania2","28 August 2014","(73%) I have a very strong feeling that this is the best X-men movie so far. It has all that made ""First class"" a fine rebooting chapter, only with a greater array of characters, a swifter pace, with more comedy and more action to enjoy. The plot, despite the vast amount that happens, is pretty simple and well assembled, and everything throughout feels like the makers actually cared about making a good movie and not just a milk cow for the big studio's coffers. This is a very enjoyable, well put together, big hitter that's well worth a trek to the cinema, and will likely mark a high point in this year's superhero movie line up.","

"davidgee","13 June 2014","The sequel/prequel element makes for a complex storyline and there are some 'borrowed' themes from the TERMINATOR and ROBOCOP franchises, but this doesn't interfere with the viewer's enjoyment of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The pace is terrific and the action scenes showcase CGI at its very best. I watched the 2D version, having come to feel that 3D doesn't actually add much to a good movie (or a bad one).Obviously you don't come to a film like this looking for great acting, but all the cast play their roles seriously without any pantomime send- ups. Middle age must be about to catch up with Hugh Jackman, but he's still a hunk. We mostly see the younger versions of Erik and Charles (Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy), but Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen pop up from time to time to add a bit of gravitas. Mark Camacho does a great job of recreating Richard M. Nixon, that most devious of presidents. There's a welcome surprise appearance at the end, and the suggestion that messing with time really does have consequences.DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really raises the bar on sequels and remakes. It may be the best X-MEN yet. It's certainly the best, so far, of this summer's blockbusters.","

"terrywdhs","20 May 2014","Easily the best X Men film yet with a storyline that requires you to think whilst marvelling at the amazing special effects and action scenes taking place before your eyes. James McAvoy puts in a superb performance as an embittered Professor X and there are great performances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their respective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is going to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called Quicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and likability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required to rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an absolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene of the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will want to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel at. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely miss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film does have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a football stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect in the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight and entertain young and old alike.","

"Sjhm","13 June 2014","Originally, I came home from the theatre and gave this a 6. I enjoyed it marginally more than the other blockbuster. But I have come to realise that 6 is unfair to the other movies I've given a 6 to, and the absolutely dreadful and badly cut together script for this film dials it down to a 4. Not even the dream team of Sir Patrick and Sir Ian with their mini-mes, McAvoy and Fassbender can drag this film up. Hugh Jackman is a great tough guy. He has made Wolverine his own, and usually that would be a good enough reason to watch, but not this one.The good. The CGI is spectacular. The bad. The plot. It leaps about from seventies to the future. Backwards and forwards, half the time the timeline of the story is so fudged you don't actually know what is happening. For instance, you clearly see Bobby (Iceman) die. Killed by the robots. But a little later he's alive and well. This is apparently caused by the few embattled X-Men leaping back in time so that they were ""never there"". The hook is Logan going back to the 70s to prevent Mystique killing Trask. Because if she kills Trask (who designs the robots), after his death they take her DNA and are somehow able, because Trask's design exists to make his design really work just from a basic prototype. Trask really, really hates mutants. In fact his fellow mutant-hater Stryker comments on this. The reason for Trask's hatred and cruelty to those different to himself are completely unclear. We know why Stryker hates mutants. But Trask. No idea, and his answer to Stryker's question doesn't explain anything. It also seems a very strange hook to hang the story on. A scientist in the 70s develops a rabid hatred for mutants, and unilaterally creates a robot to destroy this one MAYBE threat. (Which wasn't any kind of threat until he started tinkering).The CGI is spectacular. It is big, loud and utterly summer blockbuster. But without the humanity in the film, and the message that Xavier is more humane than most humans, we did actually get from the first movie thank you very much, without any real honest motivation for what Trask was doing, and the dizzying leaps back and forth in time this film is hard to follow or care about the fate of the characters. I have nothing against Jennifer Lawrence, she's a fine actress, but Rebecca Romijn's natural grace and calmness would have made for a more interesting protagonist. Jennifer simply isn't as graceful or as magnetic. (At least in this film). Mystique's reactions to the files she finds in Trask's office safe seem curiously out of character for the beautiful and deadly Mystique.This is supposed to be a superhero movie. On this showing there was nothing that super, and certainly not that heroic about the film. Jossing every single thing that went before also seems to be an error of judgement. Watching it, I was basically praying for it to end. Not the way I want to feel about an X-Men film. Thoroughly disappointed.","

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","3 June 2014","X-Men: Days Of Future Past is a movie about the slippery paradoxes and mutable mechanics of time travel. Although the storyline was conceived back in the early '80s for a two-issue run of the Uncanny X-Men comic book, it feels like it was dreamed up especially to solve the problem Fox faced after 2011's X-Men: First Class: what to do with a franchise that's been split into two time-lines, with two sprawling casts? The answer, clearly, is to put all of it in a big pot and stir. Coming back to direct is Bryan Singer, who seems to have himself jumped back in time. Whether he's been recharged by his decade away from the series, or by the prospect of eradicating some of the dodgier plot-turns made by Brett Ratner's The Last Stand, this is easily the most on-form and playful he's been since X2.The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The opening scene alone made me feel like a kid again: pitting young mutants against a teeming mass of unstoppable Sentinel robots. And that's just the beginning. Magneto's prison escape from the Pentagon is well executed and Mystique has some great scenes just on her own.Jumping between the future and the past, the plot teeters on the edge of becoming exhaustingly knotty. Fortunately, the story distracts from any temporal muddles by zeroing in on three of the most charismatic characters in the X-universe: Wolverine, plus the younger iterations of Xavier and Magneto. My issues with the movie are minuscule, at least for me; however, they are obvious. First off, Wolverine doesn't have his metal claws. I don't like his bone claws. And even though I do like the ending a lot (it's one of the best endings ever in comic book movie history), it means they have erased EVERYTHING about the X-Men franchise even the good things. So that means the first two X-Men movies didn't happen, as well as the bad ones. It's now just X-Men First Class and this movie. The best X-Men EVER, this sequel/prequel/reboot trashes the '70s with élan.), What's here is all good (with some minor exceptions). The characters are all good, and the stakes are really high, and the execution is well done. This is the X-Men movie I wanted, and now, I hope that they will make more X-Men movies like this one: strong emphasis on characters, action, stakes, and a good solid story.","

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","23 May 2014","Following CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER, Marvel continues with the Political Thriller template, and in X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, none other than Richard Nixon is in cahoots with a greedy entrepreneur who plans to exterminate mutants by using robotic war machines That's President Richard Milhouse Nixon, the current Commander-in-Chief as it's 1973 since Wolverine was sent back to the past so that Mystique, also known as Raven, doesn't get captured by authorities which would result in well let's just say there's no more X-MEN if he doesn't set things straight...And of course Logan's not alone, providing the last entry, FIRST CLASS, to coincide with the original lineup – although FUTURE PAST is more of that movie's sequel with Hugh Jackman serving as special guest star. Meanwhile the likes of veteran members Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halley Berry are wasted on a subplot dealing with some kind of purgatory dimension resembling the THOR universe.The best scenes are also the funniest, mostly having to do with Wolverine's '70s culture shock and slacker mutant Peter aka Quicksilver and his penchant for not only speeding past everyone else, but perceiving them in the same wry, sarcastic manner Wolverine did in the original film, also directed by Bryan Singer which, to give due credit, started the Marvel monopoly in the first place. And those were indeed the great old days...For now, in the midst of an otherwise promising time travel espionage, one excruciatingly overlong sequence involving Xavier in his virtual reality brain-machine, trying to coax Raven from assassinating a mutant-hating businessman (the only real villain on board), deletes potential as the characters waste so much verbal energy explaining and/or pontificating past and future events, nothing very suspenseful occurs in the meantime.","

"The-Social-Introvert","24 August 2014","I watched X-Men: Days of Future Past in the cinema in 2D as a conclusion of a 7 day mutant movie marathon. Yes, that's 7 says of watching X-Men movies – one per day. That's quite a tall order for myself seeing as though I was never really into the movies (loved the 90's cartoon though) and I must say I was pretty burnt out by the time the end credits started rolling for The Wolverine. Being dragged along to the film this weekend meant I had to watch/re-watch all the previous installments which I'll admit is not something I had fun doing.The first two films were very important for comic book movies. Along with Spiderman 1 and 2 they paved the way for the current superhero crave. I somewhat enjoyed them on my recap whilst acknowledging that they are children's movies, meaning I had to adjust my mentality whilst watching. The third had potential but was ultimately disappointing due to a number of creative decision. First Class was a much better effort with an exceptional cast – it felt fresh and reignited the franchise.Don't get me started on the Wolverine movies.The first thing you'd notice about Days of Future Past is who's in it. You have the likes of Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, Ellen Page, Patrick Stewart and Shawn Ashmore. Whoa. That's a roster that would make Wes Anderson blush. The film handles its impressive cast pretty well, and most of the actors seemed invested in their characters. There are obviously people who would be disappointed with certain people not getting enough screen- time. I myself was a little upset that Ian McKellen wasn't around for much – though he did get an awesome moment against a bunch of sentinels. A lot of the 'now' actors hog a lot of the screen, like Fassbender and Lawrence, but that's OK since they are pivotal to the story. Wanna see more McKellen, CineRanter? Go and watch X-Men 2.Performances all round are good. Jackman is on fine form once again as Wolverine, and his character opens up a lot more than before once he makes his trip down to the past. The Magnetos and Professor Xs delivered flawlessly again, and there was good supporting work from the likes of Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult. 'Old' Magneto was played with subtle brilliance by McKellen, who gave of an air of compunction and regret, whilst his counter-part was fuelled with anger and drive. However, I could have done without Ellen Page's Japanese porn star-like squealing in the sending-back scene. I wasn't too impressed with Jennifer Lawrence either. Her character, ever since First Class, has been written much more differently from the first X-Men movies. Despite there being a huge gap in time, where a person can obviously change, Mystique is no longer cold andscary? She's far too open in this and a change in voice or something could have helped separate the character from the actress. I even though the makeup was a bit off. Mystic suddenly becomes involved in some kind of love triangle which was not presented previously.As far as the story goeswell, time travel is very hard to get right. Only a few films have done it perfectly, such as 12 Monkeys, and there are undoubtedly going to be 'plot-holes' galore. Days of Future Past leave the idea of fate/destiny open (that is until we see Apocalypse) and other aspects of time travel are just not dealt with which is an ideal way to avoid confusion. If we're going to try and think scientifically about all this then none of the X-Men movies would be with us. The premise is good – The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history (hint hint) and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants (nudge nudge) – and the execution is satisfactory. It clears up some mess from previous instalments pretty well and a lot of continuity errors can be dismissed by the fact that the First Class set of characters and in a different universe to the 'old' X-Men (and it seems the film says a big ""Fuck you!"" to Brett Ratner at times). The movie's two-and-a-bit hours drifts at a consistent pace with the cast of characters moving from set-piece to set-piece in flashy fashion. Humour is blended with action and drama seamlessly (Oh, that groovy 70's tune!) and there are Easter-eggs plentiful to please the hard-core fans. Not to mention some special cameos. One thing I really enjoy in fantasy films is when real life events are incorporated. I'm of course talking about the JFK bullet- bending material which made me chuckle.Unlike a lot of modern action films, you can actually see what is going on in the fight scenes (looking at you Winter Solider). Someone clearly threw the Shaky Cam out of the window, and it's a beautiful thing. The 'future' fight scenes were great eye candy (especially those portals) and the 'past' ones were grounded and consistently spread out. There was no 'epic' end fight scene as I expected after seeing Singer's first two X-Men films which makes it easier for the next movie not to try and one- up it, which is becoming a problem with comic book movie sequels. Also, Marvel fans may have an Avengers-esque déjà vu with the post credit scene teasing a 'big baddie'.Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/movie-review-x- men-days-of-future-past/","

"diac228","4 July 2014","X-Men Days of Future Past should go down as the blockbuster film that had arguably the most daunting task you'll see from a Summer flick: successfully combining a rebooted franchise with the franchise it had just replaced. Luckily for all of us there's a good old-fashioned time travel story to connect the two without too many continuity disruptions. Bringing back the man that delivered the best of the X-Men films up to this point, 20th Century Fox went all out to ensure that they can still hang on to the Marvel franchise.Based off of the highly-successful comic book series, Days of Future Past revolves around Wolverine (And not Kitty) heading back to the past to prevent a murder from occurring and creating the fallout that would lead to the dystopian-like present that involves all the mutants hiding for their lives. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the only constant that connects the two series of X-Men films, is the only hope to unite Professor X and Magneto in the 70s to prevent the creation of the ultra-powerful Sentinels. The emotional fallout from the events of First Class is overwhelmingly present so this movie feels a lot like a sequel and less as a mere connecting bridge between the X-Men films. Newcomers to the X-Men brand would probably be lost.The time-traveling quirks and limitations that made Back to the Future a masterpiece are not present here; the focus is entirely on the characters and the task they have at hand. X-Men fans shouldn't be too upset because they get to see a heavy slew of the mutants including Quicksilver, Colossus, Storm, among others. Too bad most of the X-Men are condensed to cameo-like appearances.And yea.....still no Gambit.....Whatever the film lacks in humor and action, it makes up for it with the heavy set of drama, bouts with forgiveness vs. justice, and the genuine care you will have towards our heroes. But like I said, the action is rather lacking and after nearly 15 years of X-Men being on the screen the battling becomes well repetitive. Which is a shame because Bryan Singer can craft good action sequences, especially when Quicksilver was involved. The Quicksilver appearance further proves the dulling of the fighting in X-Men when we see Magneto once again picking up something heavy with his mind and see Wolverine once again slash his way through opponents. After seeing the creative battles occurring on the Disney side, it gets hard to be blown away by anything here.There is plenty of heart and good performances, but you can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed at the X-Men as this is the seventh film featuring at least one of the mutants since 2000. Back then the X-Men was the peak of joyful comic book mayhem as we saw lots of interesting characters work together and showcase their abilities. But after the likes of The Incredibles, The Dark Knight, The Avengers, and even the recent Captain America, the competition has caught up. It is time to expand the scope, and push the franchise farther ahead with more risks, more surprises, and more twists.X-Men Days of Future Past will be sure to delight modern-day X-Men fans while slightly upsetting the hardcore crowd, but it doesn't quite top the quality batch of comic book movies we have seen within the past 5 years. Here's to hoping Apocalypse can shake things up a bit now that the transition between X-Men series is complete.","

"Eightiesjunkie","10 November 2014","(Spoiler Warning) I'm really scratching my head on this one guys, this movie's been hailed as ""The best x-men movie ever!"" I'm sorry, but I REALLY have to disagree on this one. Before I state all the reasons why I hated this movie, let me start off with two positive comments: Hugh Jackman is still good as Wolverine, and the character of Quicksilver, was pretty cool. Now for the numerous reasons as to why I hated this film. So we start off looking at a destroyed, post apocalyptic, landscape that looks like it was ripped off from the first two Terminator movies. We then get some narration from Charles Xavier. He explains that most of the mutant population has been enslaved or killed by these killer machines known as sentinels. Then we see a small group of mutants who are both hiding, and trying to fight the sentinels. Xavier tells them that the only chance for the mutant race to survive, is to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of a government scientist, which in turn prevents the deployment of the sentinels. So Wolverine is sent back through time, and must prevent fellow mutant Mystique, from doing the deed. You would think that a plot involving time travel would be intriguing and interesting right? Well not in this movie! There's almost no action, The actors are bland, and you couldn't care less for any of the characters! That's only the tip of the iceberg folks! What really kills it is the fact the the plot has more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese! Before I talk about that though, let me back up a bit. When ""X-men first class"" came out, I thought to myself: Okay cool, they're rebooting the x-men franchise and making a whole new series."" Turns out they weren't, the only reason why ""X-Men first class was made, was so that they could create a whole new continuity that they could smash together with the old continuity. The result of this, is a clusterf*cked mess! This film won't leave you feeling good or entertained, it will only leave you with a head full of questions. Such as these: Why is Xavier alive in the future, when we clearly saw him being killed by the phoenix in part 3? Why does Wolverine have bone claws in the past, but metal claws in the future? Why does Xavier claim to have known Mystique since she was a child, when there was no indication of that in the original films? Why does Wolverine claim that in the future he and Hank McCoy (Beast) are friends when there was no previous indication of that? In the climax of the film, the sentinels have already been built. Even though they succeed in their mission, what's there to stop someone else from using them? How does Wolverine survive for so long underwater? Did Mystique perform the adamantium experiments on Wolverine? Why and how are Cyclops and Jean Grey alive again at the end? This movie doesn't even so much as attempt to answer any of the questions that it leaves the viewer with! Frankly, it would be easier to solve a Rubik's cube on LSD than it would be be to figure this movie out! So far, I've never been impressed with ANY of the X-men films. 1 and 2 were lame, 3 was garbage, and this one was even worse! I'm done with this franchise! I don't care what they do with the next film, I've put up with all the incompetence I can take! From now on, it's just the x-men comics and cartoons for me. Sorry 20th century fox, but you guys blew it!","

"LinkGoku","14 November 2014","In the future Sentinels are hunting and killing mutants, in an attempt to save mutantkind Wolverine is sent back to the past to change the future.Movies that take on time travel take a huge risk, it generally makes for a flawed film. After seeing several good reviews about X-men: Days of Future Past I hoped it would be good. Nope.First off the explanation for time traveling is just a cheap mutant ability to keep fans from questioning it. They also use the same excuse to exclude the butterfly effect from occurring.Secondly the current timeline that is supposed fix all connection problems from the original trilogy to X-men: First Class is so horribly flawed I truly don't understand how fans can stick up for this nonsense.The action scenes were mediocre, nothing amazing. The acting, uninteresting. They have great talent like Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters and make them look like they're B-list forgettable actors. Its really sad.This movie is so horribly overrated by fanboys that it currently resides on the IMDb's top 250 list. Its rated higher then classic films like the original Planet of the Apes and Arsenic and Old Lace.This is dumb filmmaking for audiences who want to watch loads of special effects and lame but good looking actors. Wanna watch a new action film with good characters and emotions? Try Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A film with logic.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","18 June 2014","I couldn't have said it better myself, or anyone else. This X-Men instalment is THE X-Men film that the fans have been anticipating since the beginning. I can even go ahead and say that this is the one that will even convert non-fans into fans, it's that good.Days of Future Past reinvents what the series can do in such a fresh way, without rebooting it completely may I remind you. Most of all it is a time travel film, and there are some issues with the continuity but all can be forgiven after sitting through this film completely. It mends all the mistakes of the past X-Men films (in terms of quality) and feels closer to the comics than the first three movies.I have to admit that I keep comparing too many superhero movies to The Dark Knight in terms of the story and the characterisation, but I only compare Days of Future Past to it in the ""reinventing the franchise"" way and also telling a bigger story that is darker and meaner. It gets so much right: The Sentinels, Wolverine, and the mixing of the all-star cast of X-Men 1-3 (including Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) and even the cast from X-Men: First Class (featuring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender).The story, the direction, the editing, the music and particularly Quicksilver's soon-to-be classic scene, all adds up to one thrilling ride that doesn't deserve to be missed by any X-Men fan out there. I couldn't recommend this movie enough. It's like Avengers but with a whole world of weird and wonderful mutants.A well deserved 9/10 is what this movie gets.","

"holifeno","13 May 2014","The Parisian premiere was yesterday and therefore, I actually did see the movie and let me tell you this: all the waiting and fuss around this movie is well worth it and well deserved. It is a great movie, easily relatable in many ways.I won't say a word about the acting. When you have established actors such as McAvoy — who repeatedly stole the screen with his heart-clenching performance — and Fassbender, along with their older 'counterparts' — McKellen and Stewart — you are in for a treat when it comes to the acting performance itself. No surprise there.This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes — much like Marvel's latest movies — are still very relevant in the world today. You will see that yourself.The movie is action packed. There is no irrelevant scenes — I tend to judge movies by the ratio of irrelevant scenes per minute in it — and there is no break between action scenes and more emotional, storyline scenes. You won't be bored. But along with the action, and the acting, there is also the usual dose of humor found in most Marvel movies, without being out of place and without cutting the pace of the movie in itself. There, Hugh Jackman will provide you with a few laughs, or at least, will bring a smile to your face.The cinematography in itself was excellent. Excellent use of the 3D. Great camera work — at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D.So, why not 10 out of 10 then? Because of the score. If the soundtrack was good, it didn't match what I got used to with the recent Marvel movies. Good score but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe it was because we were all more focused on the fast-paced action scenes and the storyline in itself rather than whatever was playing behind. I might need to go back and watch it again once it's out for general public to really appreciate the little details that I might have missed in a cinema filled with excited fans.But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. A good movie. A great Xmen movie. Full of Easter eggs for more hardcore fans as well. The waiting was worth it.","

"Vartiainen","2 July 2014","X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly an ambitious project, attempting to stitch together both film franchises, the original X-Men trilogy as well as the 2011 semi-reboot X-Men: First Class. And the way it accomplishes this is certainly both effective and commendable. The story is believable, most of the important loopholes get closed and as a whole it's just a lot of fun.The best thing here are the actors. Pretty much all the actors from both franchises reprise their roles, which is an impressive feat and all around heartwarming. The main show belongs to Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) as well as Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender (Erik Lehnsherr). All five are talented actors in their own right and they absolutely nail these characters and give us some really good character moments. The rest of the cast is equally up to the task and it's great to see so many of them in the same film, seeing that X-Men has always been about a group of people coming together to fight greater evil.But here I have to be honest and admit that I was kind of expecting more from the story. Once again mutants are threatened by evil, bigoted men and it's up the X-Men to stop this threat before the society slides out of balance. We've seen this before, and while the execution here is superb and allows an old story to feel refreshing, it's still an old story. And there were a couple of clear points in the movie, where they could have broken the mold, but instead they went with the expected. Sure it's faithful to the comic books, but these characters are so huge that there would have been room for variance.And that leaves me with a conundrum. I loved the characters, I loved the action scenes, I loved the production values, but I honestly cannot say the same about the story. I didn't dislike it either, but it could have been so much better with so little effort. The film is still worth seeing, easily, but you should be advised that if you're expecting something new story-wise, you're not going to get it. Although the final ending is great in its own indulgent way.","

"talarisw","25 May 2014","This is the best movie in the series and of the year! Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of the x-men. I read the comics, I watched the 90's cartoon, their my favorite comic book title from Marvel and 2nd only to batman. The x-men film series is my personal favorite film series of all-time! I think 20th century fox has done a great job handling the series and I'm happy with every installment. But even though I couldn't wait to see this movie I was a little worried about the time line & continuity in this film, there were already continuity issue starting with ""first class"" but Singer said he wanted to fix those problems. And since this film has wolverine going back to 1973, I was worried about how that fits with ""origins"" and I was also worried about the fact that the sentinels were created in the 70's but no where to be found in the original x-men trilogy. But I'm very happy to say that the story works perfectly and dosen't really contradict the other films! Before I talk about the great actors and special effects I must talk about how great the story is and Singer did ""fix"" the continuity. First off they explained how professor X was able to walk after getting paralyzed in ""first class(FC) because that was one of the major continuity problems in that we saw Xaviar get paralyzed in ""FC"" but in flashbacks of ""origins"" & ""last stand"" which took place in the 80's he was walking but here they explain he can walk thanks to a serum by Hank so that gives a good explanation for that. They did a good job explaining how the sentinels fit into the previous story line, so in 1973 professor X was depressed & magneto was locked in prison so mystique was left on her own and she killed Trask but was briefly captured where scientist took her blood & 50 years later they used her blood to create sentinels that can shape shift to adapt to whoever their fighting. So that perfectly explains why there were no sentinels in the previous x-men films. Mystique killed Trask in '73 so no sentinels were created. And they didn't know that mystique's blood would be used to create unstoppable killer robots 50 years later. So in the background of X1, X2, X3 and the wolverine Trask industry was working on bringing back the sentinels until they had the technology to use mystique's blood for the sentinels. But this movie does make me wonder what happened in the original time line, I mean how did professor X get out of his funk & started the school again and how did magneto and mystique get out of custody but the good thing there's still like a 30 year gap between the events of '73 and the 1st x-men movie so a lot could of happened. So seeing a middle age professor X & Magneto in a flashback in ""last stand"" where they meet a child Jean Grey dosen't seem to be out of place in the continuity. And wolverine traveling back to 1973 dosen't contradict too much with ""origins"". Wolverine has the bone-claws like in origins and I like how they made him wake-up in the 70's, he had another life going on. I like when the women called him Jimmy which was revealed to be his real name in ""origins"" so I liked that connection. The only problem is that William Stryker in this film is a young man in his 20's or maybe early 30's but in ""origins"" he meets wolverine & Victor in Vietnam & he was in his 40's. But other then that it fits pretty well. Stryker probably met Wolverine & Victor in Vietnam and soon after joining him, wolverine left to be alone for 6 years. But since there was no specific year showed in ""origins"" you can be flexible there. My only criticism is that we don't see more of the horrible future but maybe it's for the best 'cause it was pretty dark & sad. But I think they could of explained a little more like how professor X came back alive after ""last stand"". I would've liked to see more of storm, iceman, colossus and Bishop. But at least we got to see them do some cool stuff with their powers. All the actors did a great job & despite playing wolverine for 6 movies Jackman is still awesome, his gruff personality is so appealing and I like that even in the horrible future he's still smoking his cigars. McAvoy & Fassbender are perfect as the younger Xaviar & Magneto. Peter Dinkalege is great as Bolivia Trask. I like how William Stryker works into story. I love the look of the sentinels, the ""future ones"" look really scary and the ""past ones"" looks perfect to the iconic comic book version. The plot is unpredictable and leaves you with doubt about if they can save the future. It's a really well written story with great emotional depth & strong performances from everyone. I love Jennifer Lawerence as mystique. I love the actor playing quicksilver, his look & personality was just like in the comics, he was funny and stoled every scene. I love how they hinted at magneto being his father like in the comics. I love the cameos at the end by Kelsey Grahmer as beast, James Mardeson as cyclops, the hot Anna Paquin as rogue and the sexy Famake Janeson as Jean Grey, as well as a cameo by Bryan Singer himself. Although it's kinda sad to know that the first 3 x-men movies didn't happen but at least wolverine remembers it. I like how the movie ended with many possibilities, no specific direction for the sequel. I love the post credit scene showing the next villain, ""apocalypse"" in ancient Egypt being worshiped as a god. A great film in a classic film series!","

"Fluke_Skywalker","16 October 2014","I've never really cared much for X-Men in any format, but I did like 2011's 'First Class'. Unfortunately, despite a few clever bits, I found 'Days of Future past' to be a rather flat re-hash of the tired X-Men formula; Humans are afraid of mutants. Xavier and Magneto argue over how to deal with this. Blah, blah, blah. It's been five movies of this same sort of thing now. It's beyond played out.For the uninitiated this is likely to be a rather confusing slog. There are a lot of characters and story elements here that have little to no set up, and much of it goes back several films. And even for those who have been along for the ride there's not much pay off here. You can see every twist and turn coming from a mile away.'Days of Future Past' is a well made, well acted, but ultimately mediocre film.","

One of the scenes that I felt was rather touching was when the younger Charles encountered his older self reminding him to hope again and a rather touching moment between older Eric and Charles, Evan peters was quite funny as Peter. However I did feel that some characters were underused like rogue who appears in a very brief cameo. I thought bishop was interesting but the other characters like blink, sunspot, and warpath were not given much to do. However I would say the events of this film set up the next adventure x men Apocalypse,","

"john-collie-1","8 July 2023","X-Men: Days of Future Past is an absolute triumph in the superhero genre, effortlessly weaving together an intricate storyline, breathtaking action sequences, and an emotional depth that leaves audiences in awe. Directed by Bryan Singer, this 2014 installment in the X-Men franchise stands out as one of the most captivating and thought-provoking entries in the series.From the opening scene to the final credits, Days of Future Past grabs hold of your attention and never lets go. The film seamlessly combines the past and the future as the mutants face a bleak dystopian future where both mutants and humans are on the verge of extinction. The genius lies in the narrative structure, which ingeniously brings together the original X-Men cast with their younger counterparts from the prequel series.

The ensemble cast, including the likes of Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Patrick Stewart, deliver powerhouse performances that showcase their immense talent and dedication to their respective characters. Each actor brings depth and complexity to their roles, allowing us to connect with the inner struggles and emotional journeys of the mutants.One aspect that sets X-Men: Days of Future Past apart is its exploration of the consequences of actions and the choices we make.

Amidst the breathtaking action set pieces, the movie never loses sight of its emotional core, creating a compelling and resonant experience.Visually, the film is a spectacle to behold. The special effects are top-notch, seamlessly blending the mutant abilities with the real world. The action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, leaving you on the edge of your seat. The production design and cinematography are equally impressive, bringing the past and future worlds to life in vivid detail.The musical score by John Ottman deserves special mention. It heightens the emotional impact of the story, adding depth and intensity to the already gripping scenes. The soundtrack perfectly captures the essence of the X-Men universe, enhancing the overall experience.X-Men: Days of Future Past is not just a superhero movie; it's a compelling tale that explores the complexities of humanity, friendship, and the power of hope. It stands as a testament to the genre's potential for storytelling and pushes the boundaries of what a superhero film can achieve.Whether you're a die-hard X-Men fan or simply a lover of thrilling and thought-provoking cinema, this film will captivate you from start to finish.

"p-stepien","2 June 2014","In the convoluted time-travelling plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past, Fox molds two X-Men franchises into one, by colliding the future mutants, now living in the post-Sentinel cleansing wastelands of Earth with the past versions of themselves from Nixon-era 1970s. With mutant genocide bringing about the collapse of civilisation, the remnants of the mutants, including core X-Men members: Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Warpath (Booboo Stewart) and the once infamous Magneto (Ian McKellen) attempt one last daring ploy to avert the imminent disaster. This means Wolverine must be sent into the past with the use of Kitty Pryde's powers to stop the murder of Sentinel mastermind Dr Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) by mutant rights activist turned rogue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The future's hope lays in averting the past - thus Wolverine must force the downtrodden and resigned drunkard Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the imprisoned Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) to stop the occurrences of days to come from ever coming into being. Only Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and a fickle youth Quicksilver (Evan Peters) are willing to aide the best at what he does...Amongst the many faucets of success of Bryan Singer in he reclaiming of the franchise, one seems to be strongly undervalued by most viewers. Despite an onslaught of characters the X-Men are rejuvenated thanks to one simple truth: not all character need to be character studies and albeit each of the cast receives their moment in the limelight, the X-Men resonate all so much more strongly that the super-powered mutants need no introduction. To a varying extent introduced in previous episodes of the series, most of the characters function as direct imprints from the comics, cartoon series or previous movies with the entire mythology appropriated to them. They need not be presented, delved in, they just function as part of a well-oiled team of superheroes. Much like in the comics the movie finally understands that focus can only be placed on a select number of characters, the rest operate within action sequences to wow the audience into submission, while the drama evolves around just a few in their midst.Thankfully also focus shifts away from Wolverine, the franchises most important and recognisable character, towards the trio of Professor X, Eric Lensherr and Mystique. Wolverine still features heavily in the plot, but is mostly a backup cast member with limited impact on proceedings, but with charm and character attributes helping to liven up the story throughout. Nonetheless McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence shine with a well-thought out plot centred around the morality of Mystique and the dark path she has chosen to follow. Support cast is unanimously superb within their characters, even if they receive but a few minutes of screen time they each memorably capture their moments: Storm is godlike and enchanting, Colossus is almighty, Blink has a lingering presence, Iceman is all-powerful, while Magneto of the past and future display their otherworldly power. Quicksilver naturally steals the show, but Singer has improved in leaps and bounds in his presentation of fight sequences. Only Bishop cries out for more screen time and focus, which hopefully he will receive come X-Men: Apocalypse.Also thoroughly enjoyed the teamwork, so key to the comic book, that is on show throughout all the future sequences of battles with Sentinels.It says a lot that the two mayor flaws of the movie are its short runtime of 130 minutes (it honestly feels like the movie could easily go on for another 60 or so minutes and never lose traction on the audience) and the fact that we have to wait for the next episode of the series for another 2 years (how I wish this was a mega-budget several episode series...). Minor faults of the feature are some laboured story, which at times struggles to piece together the plot holes of past episodes, and the somewhat funny, but ultimately jarring, jokes centred around Magneto's supposed involvement in the assassination of J.F.Kennedy.By far the best comic-book movie of the year and arguably only inferior to ""The Dark Knight"". The mouthwatering prospect of X-Men: Apocalypse is just too far away to bear...","

"agblum","25 May 2014","Brian Singer, Director of the first 2 Critical and Fan Praised X-Men Films, return to the Director's chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" brought High Expectations. My Verdict – Singer and Company Delivered!!!The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but quickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" is sent back to 1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot ""Sentinels"" which basically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the present day. The X-Men First Class Cast Members – James McVoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), and Nicholas Hoult (Beast), reprise their roles for the 1973 setting, 11 years after the story of ""First Class"". The acting from the entire cast is pretty much wonderful, including newcomer Evan Peter's Quicksilver, a subject of on-line worry leading up to the film, is great!!! And special mention should also be given to Mark Camacho, who scenes as President Richard Nixon are well done!

"bluetanker_07","21 May 2014","X-Men: Days Of Future PastJust got home from watching the most awaited X- Men movie this year, Days of Future Past. And my reaction? Meh, are you kidding me...It's like the best X-Men movie after X2.Bryan Singer really did well on directing this movie. He is really an X-Men geek! He always know what to give to these starving X-Men fans.The movie is so intense, very emotional, and really puts you to the edge of your seat. Some fans might not like it, cause there's not much of 'explosions' or 'jump-packed-actionsm-scenes', this movie shows more of what these mutant can do with their powers. And don't get me wrong, I actually like how Singer did to this movie. Perhaps he was just avoiding the audience to get confused of the scenes from 'Past', then 'Future' then some 'Flashbacks'.I also liked how they highlighted the abilities of #Quicksilver and #Blink. I am actually looking forward more on Quicksilver's performance on the upcoming ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" since he really did good during this movie.And man, #JamesMcAvoy, the young Charles, stole the movie in terms of acting and drama. His emotions shown in this movie were so intense. #Mystique you are love as ever, Mutant and Proud!!! #Wolverine is still him here, not much for a change (though he has seen the young Stryker) but I wonder what will happen now since #JeanGrey and #Cyclops are back? And may I ask why #AnnaPaquin's #Rogue was so little? And please give more action+screen time to a classic X-Man - Storm next time. #Storm is really an underrated X- Men character.I can't detail all of what had happened in the movie, but yes, obviously, I like the movie a lot! And that's just me, others might hate it. But I am one of those people who actually liked the movie so much. And by the way, if your watching the movie STAY UNTIL THE VERY END. This is a Marvel movie, so expect a post-credit scene or should I call it a stinger. You will see, if I am right the horsemen & perhaps some hints of ""Apocalypse"". Oh well, you should totally watch it. 9/10.#XMenDoFP #XMenApocalypseSooooon #XMenSpoilers","

"toqtaqiya2","27 June 2014","X-Men: Days Of Future Past marks the end of an era. The cast that people got used to over the last 15 years makes its final appearance. It's a bit sad to see actors like Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) go because they were so charismatic in their roles. In this film too they show their excellent acting abilities. It's actually nice to see familiar faces return. Halle Berry (Storm), Shawn Ashmore (Iceman) and Daniel Cudmore (Colossus) took part in the action, while others returned to nicely conclude everything at the end. Days Of Future Past is a sequel to both The Last Stand (2006) and First Class (2011). The satisfying ending isn't the only thing that director Bryan Singer was thorough with. This sequel has been called the best X-Men film yet by some reviewers. My opinion is that First Class is the best X-Men film so far, but Days Of Future Past is just about as good. But let's not forget about X2 (2003), which is another worthy contender for the best X-Men film. I'm not someone who likes the X-Men films much. I think that none of them have been perfect so far. They all have something that prevents them from being great films or some of the best superhero films. They're first and foremost blockbusters that are meant to entertain. Some scenes in Days Of Future Past can be seen again and again, especially the spectacular opening sequence that introduces a nightmarish new threat. In terms of action Singer is at the top of his game here. The tone is softened after the incredibly grim introduction. Some may think this wise, but once Wolverine is in the past the film loses momentum, introduces characters that aren't very interesting, humor that isn't very funny, action that isn't very exciting, and details that aren't very clever. Some people may think that Magneto's connection to the JFK assassination was clever but, in my opinion, it was handled poorly by Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The film slows down noticeably in the middle. This minor problem is what prevents me from giving Days Of Future Past a very good rating. What happens at the end though is just as interesting and entertaining as what happens at the beginning. The action is terrific and John Ottman's good score is used to great effect. Days Of Future Past is a long film, with 131 minutes of running time. Still, considering its epic time-traveling story and its many characters I can say that Singer and Kinberg succeeded in making the film satisfying. Much of the cast can be applauded for their efforts. Stewart and McKellen, as I mentioned before, are excellent as usual in their roles. Hugh Jackman is as reliable as always as Wolverine. Many people forget that Jackman is a good actor. He proved it in films like The Fountain (2006) and Prisoners (2013) and even in schlock like Kate & Leopold (2001) and Van Helsing (2004). Jennifer Lawrence, playing Mystique, is fine in her role but nothing special in my opinion. When she's covered with blue paint she's not as menacing or as sexy as Rebecca Romijn was in the role. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get to impress only at the end of the film. Before that there's really nothing to write about concerning their acting. They're clearly not as charismatic as they were in First Class. In fact, McAvoy simply annoyed me while he was doing his depressed Charles Xavier bit. His acting, thankfully, improved when Xavier tried to convince Mystique to abandon the course that she was on. The only other thing that I have to add about Days Of Future Past is that it doesn't contain as much establishment propaganda as First Class. In First Class it was just obvious. ""Mutant and proud"" was clearly a metaphor for ""gay and proud."" In case you didn't know, I'll mention that for the Anglo-American establishment pro-gay propaganda is very important. It's one of their tactics to reduce human population on the planet because they think that there's way too many people now. So being fine with homosexuality and not having children is what the ruling class wants for the lower classes. Globalization is another thing that's very important for the establishment. The story takes place in different countries and there's also an international cast involved. In Days Of Future Past, the Russians and the Chinese are mentioned as enemies that are more dangerous than the mutants. This also fits into the establishment line. Russia and China are the main enemies for the ruling class of Britain and the USA. North Korea gets most of the hate these days, but China and especially Russia aren't far behind. Other than what I've mentioned there's really nothing to complain about. The visual effects, especially the Sentinels, are mostly impressive and so are the designs. Days Of Future Past suffers because of the plethora of characters. Not all of the key players are given satisfying story arcs, but I still recommend this epic yet entertaining film.","

"ss_areeb_h","9 September 2014","So far as I have seen this movie has only received positive reviews and it's not without reason. The movie is worth every penny you spend on it and more. However it is not without flaws due to which I cannot name it the best X-men movie. The plot as you should already know, involves wolverine going into the past to create a better future. The plot is well written and is very entertaining. The transition between past and present is smooth enough and will not in anyway leave you confused. However, there are a few plot holes. DNA sequencing was not discovered until the 80s. Quicksilver's age raises some questions (First Class was only 12 years before so Magneto was probably sleeping around while seeking revenge before the events of First Class).Next up.. the characters. We get to see several new characters in the future with some amazing powers and abilities. However, they feel quite hollow as you know nothing about them and you don't see much of them except in fight scenes. On the other hand, the past encompasses only 4 characters xavier, magneto, beast and mystique. Quicksilver plays a very small role and I wish I could see more of him as his character is pretty awesome. And since they introduced Quicksilver, they could also have introduced his twin sister the Scarlet Witch (would have been so very awesome). However, you get to see very few characters in the past and that's disappointing because the past is where we are most of the time. Finally the fight scenes and this is truly where the movie shines. Especially the fights with the sentinels. Each move is so well thought of, you truly feel that the mutants have mastered their powers and use it without having to think. The combination attacks are just perfect and I loved the fight scenes. Though I am gonna state some negatives here too (and you must truly think by now. Gosh will he ever shut up). I was hoping to see wolverine in action (as obviously he's my favorite character) and now that I think about it, he wasn't involved in a single god damn fight. Nothing. At all (unless you consider him beating up hapless goons a fight). I believe the move could have surpassed awesomeness though if it were based on bit more in the future. I mean not the future future the past future.. (am I making sense??) If wolverine had to go back to like 1990 or something. We could see a lot more familiar mutants maybe see a glimpse of their past as well (like storm, jean, scott etc. etc.) And the technology of sentinels would be more believable.My Final Verdict? Well of course its an X-men movie and there is no reason in hell that you should miss it. Granted its not the best X- men movie but it will definitely keep you rooted to your seat and lets face it... everyone loves watching a super hero movie. (The Fight scenes are truly Brilliant)","

"drqshadow-reviews","5 January 2015","Wolverine gallops through time and space to deflect an ugly outcome for all of humanity, pausing frequently to give old cast members the time to wink directly into the camera and strut off set. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a lot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines, but it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often associated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time delivering fan service when it should've been examining character motivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely play a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm still struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third act. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments that I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly pandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First Class. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting face-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new guys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and McKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced efforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made me yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad - the effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the little love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action roars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble shutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so demanding in that department.","

"Leofwine_draca","25 February 2017","There was a lot of love for DAYS OF FUTURE PAST on its release. It's a sequel to the X-MEN prequel FIRST CLASS that also ties it in to the older cast from the original X-MEN trilogy of the 2000s. As such there's an absolutely huge and sprawling cast of characters but director Bryan Singer just about manages to keep a grip on things so that it doesn't get too confusing.What surprised me about the film is that the much-lauded plot is nothing more than virtual copy of that seen in the TERMINATOR films, although perhaps as the comic pre-dated THE TERMINATOR it's James Cameron who did the ripping off. Certainly the story, about a future annihilated by sentient robots and the survivors sending back a sole hero through time in order to avert the disaster, is all too familiar, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is fun, that's for certain. There's a huge cast of familiar and unfamiliar faces and a constant stream of effective CGI to keep viewers occupied, so this is never a boring experience. The future scenes are clichéd and amount to little more than an FX showcase of robots vs. mutants with lots of mutant death to boot. The main story, which takes place in 1973, is better, benefiting from Hugh Jackman's likable Wolverine and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender doing their best with their engaging roles. Some of it is still too familiar, a lot of it is too over the top, and Peter Dinklage's villain is oddly irrelevant, but this is still a fun watch, albeit not one I'll be quick to revisit.","

"FeastMode","30 June 2019","Amazing movie. Incredible cast, possibly considered for the best cast of all time. A very well made film filled with character depth, development and arcs. A great story and some very unique scenes. New interesting mutants are introduced and use their abilities in cool ways. The score was intense and awesome as usual. It gave us more of an in depth look at mystique and what really drives her, as well as her relationship with magneto and the professor. And the action scenes were so creative with a lot of intensity in so many scenes (6 viewings, 4/10/2021)SPOILERSwhat they did with this movie is unprecedented. Combining the casts of the originals with the new cast within a story that strongly uses both sides is a stroke of genius. And so many connections with the rest of the franchise.","

"rbestuar","27 May 2014","I went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason why I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland, short and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this with the usual expectation of seeing something ""new"".. well I was let down.The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few scenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put a lot of effort into this movie.","

"coljam21","28 May 2014","OK so honestly I went to the theater not expecting much and got what I paid for. All the super hero movies are starting to look the same. There's no more wow factor or element of mystery, just the same old story. The best part of the movie was quick silver and he was only featured for about 5 minutes. The movie was so inconstant that it couldn't even be held together with crazy glue. How can Professor X be there to send wolverine into the past if he was killed by the phoenix 4 x-men movies ago? Did they think we would forget that tid-bit?Wolverine gets sent back to 1972 in an effort to help fix things and save Mystique, which is wonderful. Where I felt like I was slapped in the face was when a drop of her blood was recovered and Trask was able to extract her DNA for testing. Huh? Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought DNA did not exist in 1972. Also if a sentinel kills Magneto in the future shouldn't he have ceased to exist in the past?Then you had the typical mass destruction that only mutants or super heroes can cause. At this point it's become so expected and dull that even Magneto putting a baseball stadium around the white house was not worthy of a second glance. All the CGI and epic battle scenes have become cliché. And all the super hero flicks are beginning to look the same.","

"mc12000","30 May 2014","Being a X-Men comic fan, I could not wait for this movie to come out. Days of future past is one of the story arcs which define the X-Men comics and seeing that Bryan Singer came back to direct, I thought that this effort would surely bring back the X-Men franchise in the eyes of the fans....or does it. Seeing that Rogue was cut out of the theatrical release was not a good start. But when I saw that there were plenty of other mutant characters I kept my hopes up for a classic offering.As there was not a single cinema in town that offered the film in 2D in original language, I was forced watched the 3D version. Totally unnecessary and the viewing experience is made worse because the polarised glasses make the ""future"" scenes even harder to see since they are mostly filmed in darkness.My first complaint is that the movie dives straight into action. A fight between the last of the mutants and the sentinels. There is no explanation on why these were the last mutants standing, and who they were. The movie also ignores the otherworldly Marvel characters who would be more than a match for the sentinels. The sentinel powers are also given a twist, plus their design differs from what we know from the comics. Now a great start for me.Most of the film is based in 1973 and, during these parts, we see a total of 6 mutants with 4 or 5 other cameo appearances. There was no logical reason for why Wolverine chose Quicksilver for breaking into the Pentagon. Whereas the first Bryan Singer X-Men movie gave us 4 mutant villains, this movie only contained misguided characters. When compared to the other X-Men movies there are relatively fewer action scenes which really show off the mutant powers. It just felt cheap to me and to be brutally honest I was more impressed by the trailers than the film itself. I genuinely felt conned by Days of future past.The mid-credits scene was also placed after ALL the credits have rolled. That means you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of uninteresting info. I won't give away what it entails (although you can easily do a google) but I would say that it brought me very little excitement as it does not tie in with any of the other Marvel movies.The first X-Men movie in 2000 was a no-nonsense classic. The Wolverine showed promise in bringing back the same gritty action. Unfortunately, Days of future past was a disappointment for me.","

"bowmanblue","14 January 2015","I've already seen (and even own a few) of the X-men movies (and they various spin-offs/reboots). However, maybe I should have watched a few of them before I sat down to see 'X-men: Days of Future Past.' I will admit to getting a little confused with the plot, but, eventually, I settled into the film.I never could really work out whether the previous film 'First Class' was a reboot, or a prequel. Now I find it was just a prequel, as 'Days of Future Past' now cements the two universes together with that modern lynchpin of science-fiction, time travel.Star Trek got a lot of praise for merging the old and the new cast together (or at least the majority of the fanboys didn't kick off as much as the possible could). So, it seems that every sci-fi franchise feels okay using the 'time travel to create an alternate universe' scenario to gloss over any glitches merging the two films may throw up (Terminator: Genisys, I have my eye on you).We start in the future when giant robots (Sentinels) are mercilessly hunting both mutants and humans alike, cue a trip for our favourite cigar-chomping hero, Wolverine, to take a trip back in time to the seventies in order to make sure this future never sees the light of day. Therefore, the film-makers can crowbar in both the old cast (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and all) with the new lot (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender and so on). And, yes, it works – if you're okay with that sort of 'plot device.' It all feels well at home with the other X-men movies, not to mention distinctly different from Marvel's 'cinematic universe' of Iron Man, the Avengers and co. It's generally darker in tone and more serious, with less one-liners and colourful action. Not that the action isn't colourful (and even spectacular towards the climactic scenes), it just feels pretty computer generated. You get the CGI fiery person, the CGI icy person and the CGI sort of discount T-1000-type person as they battle their way through various CGI robots.But, if you can live with a CGI that probably should be a little better for the budget involved (not to mention (future) Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman's bad haircuts) then you should be able to appreciate this movie. Like I say, I got a little confused by the timelines and what everyone was doing. However, that would probably have been cleared up by watching what came before a little more recently. There's plenty of action, explosions and twists and turns in the plot. Plus – perhaps best of all – is that there's plenty of (fan favourite) Wolverine. Many had criticised his two stand-alone movies, whereas here he seems like the natural star who the film is basically all about. But, it's not just about him – there are plenty of other recognisable faces to entertain – just make sure you know your 'X-men lore' before you spend two hours watching this lot.","

"filipemanuelneto","17 October 2020","I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with prequels.This film begins in the relatively near future where Humanity has gone to war against mutants, seen as a real threat to the future of the world. And they are winning! There are fewer and fewer mutants thanks to the Sentinela Program's hunting robots, created decades earlier with the mission of developing defenses in an eventual large-scale war. Isolated in what appears to be an inaccessible spot in Tibet, the surviving X-Men allied themselves with Magneto and what remained of the Mutant Brotherhood in a kind of last stronghold of combat. Here, when using their gifts and abilities together, they decide to send Wolverine (the most resistant and the only one capable of self-regeneration) on a risky mission to the past, in order to interrupt the chain of events that would give rise to the Sentinel Program and waging war before it even starts.The film is excellent in every way, but it is necessary to be attentive to understand well, given that it takes place at the same time in the present (which corresponds to a future close to ours) and in the past. Brilliantly directed by Bryan Singer, the film has a very pleasant pace and there are no dead moments or scenes that feel out of place. Everything works like clockwork. Of course, the action is an essential part of the film. The script is original and creative, but accessible enough to be understood without having to think too much. On the one hand, it gives a logical follow-up to the events of the previous films, and on the other hand it creates a temporal paradox where the whole story is corrected, so the films that will come later will focus on this new line of events. I believe that one of the most symbolic moments of this film is the short conversation that young Xavier has with his older alter-ego of the future, a truly anthological moment.The cast is massively inherited from previous films and is composed of great actors. The majority, therefore, are already familiar with the characters, and there are many characters and a large number of great actors. The quality of the material given to the actors was reflected in the quality of their work, which is really good. Hugh Jackman has all the prominence in this film and knows how to use it. The character Xavier appears in its two cinematic versions (the mature Xavier by Patrick Stewart and the young Xavier by James McAvoy) and the same goes for Magneto/Erik (the young version is brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender while the mature version belongs to the impeccable Sir Ian McKellen). Jennifer Lawrence shone in the role of the cruel and cold Raven/Mystique and Halle Berry finally managed to find herself as Storm after a series of average performances. The film also features Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Anna Paquin, Peter Dinklage, Shawn Ashmore, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Famke Janssen and James Marsden.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. Its a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually it is a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The scenes and action sequences are great and the effects are a bonus, although the final fight sequence against the robots sometimes seems excessive. As happened almost always in this franchise, the film has excellent sets and costumes and there is a pleasant feeling of time in the scenes from the Sixties, thanks to all the details that we are observing. Cinematography is good and uses color and shadow well. The editing work was impeccable. I think it is fair to also greet the makeup department and the great soundtrack by John Ottman.","

"g-bodyl","11 April 2015","X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men movie that we have all been waiting for. The last movie that could give this film a run for its money was 2003's X2. 2011's First Class was a step in the right direction, but this film is very masterful and engaging. I loved the idea of combining old cast with new cast and the results are impressive. The story is written well and there are several emotional moments. The action is also very good and some of the set pieces are just grand. The visuals compliment the action and they come out in full-force during the scenes of Quicksilver. Bryan Singer returns to the helm to direct this film. The main theme is changing history so that the future will be different from which the past set it out to be. Wolverine is sent back to the 1970's to stop a program in which mutants are being targeted by these sentinels which are created to take out and destroy mutants. This movie has one of the greatest ensembles in recent film history. The old cast is here, the new cast is here, and they combine forces to put on a show. Hugh Jackman is ever awesome as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart/James McAvoy and Ian McKellan/Michael Fassbender are all great in their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence has some great scenes as Mystique. Peter Dinklage made a great addition to the cast as the main villain and someone to keep an eye on is Evan Peters as Quicksilver.Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the X-Men sequel we have all been waiting for. By combining old and new, we have ourselves one of the greatest comic books film ever made. Not only is there impressive action, the storyline comprises of raw human emotion and characterization. By far, this is the greatest X-Men movie made to date and I am eager to see how this universe is expanded in the future. My Grade: A+","

"theflixerdotcom","7 September 2014","To me, this is the comic book property that has the best chance of competing with the Disney/Marvel universe. This movie was much more adult focused and serious than most of the movies coming out of Disney's Marvel machine. I love the Disney movies, but this was almost like a breath of fresh air. It had it's flaws, but they have the source material, the resources, and a very solid cast available to move this franchise in the right direction.The plot of this was apparently taken from a comic book storyline which I have never read. They definitely selected the right material as I thought it was a great and well thought out story. It was also a great way to bring in the original cast. I only wish we could have seen more of them; for various reasons some of them such as Anna Paquin only had very limited screen time which I thought took away from the story a little. Especially because they were such a huge part of the original franchise. It seemed to me that the reason they weren't in the movie much didn't necessarily have anything to do with the story, and more to do with contracts. Even though I know they may not be in the comic much either I have read that at least Rogue should have had a larger part in the movie than she did.That said, the only other gripe I had was the focus on Wolverine. We have stand-alone Wolverine movies available if you love Wolverine, so it would have been nice to center the plot around another character, or characters, this time around. There are plenty to choose from and the first movie did fine without him.These complaints are mostly marginal; and not really a reflection of the movie itself. I loved the storyline and thought they did a truly great job of creating the Sentinels. You actually believe they could pose a major threat to even the most powerful of mutants. The action and effects were top notch and there were some truly great parts such as the Quicksilver sequence that I thought was very well done.The scale of the movie was also fantastic, you truly feel as if you can grasp the power these mutants posses with the ability they have to control their environment; even on a large scale.The biggest strength these movies have to me is the all star cast. With names like McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Hoult, and the fresh face of Even Peters leading this franchise into the future, there is a ton of potential to directly compete with any other comic book movie. Each of these actors is in the prime of their career at this point and they are all being assembled for these movies. They all bring a dramatic depth and believable emotion to their characters on what I believe is a higher level than any of the Avenger cast. As I mentioned earlier, these movies are more dramatic and therefore require more dramatic actors. That being said, this is the perfect cast for a more grown up and serious plot.On a side note, I hear a lot of talk about Scarlet Johansson getting the first female lead super hero movie; but I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a superior actor and Mystique is a much more interesting character and should be given a movie as well. Who wouldn't love to see that? Overall, this was a great film BUT the focus on Wolverine was a bit of a cop out. I also think the ensemble cast was a little too ambitious as it didn't give every major character from both franchises enough screen time. Outside of the that, the plot, acting, and effects were top notch and I can't wait to see the next entry in this fantastic franchise! Rating: 7.5/10","

"mauvemage","29 May 2014","Ordinary people do not matter. In many ways this film apes the way that people who belong to minorities have more rights than everyone else and think they can do whatever the hell they like.In this film the mutants have nearly been wiped out by robot Sentinels built by humans and programmed only to kill people with the mutant X gene. Yet is makes it clear in the dystopian future the movie starts in that these Sentinels also kill ordinary people, which makes no sense whatsoever.Like a lot a time-travel movies, it has daft plot holes and doesn't care about consistency. Towards the film's climax, serial murderer Magneto manages to get the anti-mutant robots to obey him by using his powers to put steel inside them. Okay, that would allow his powers to work on these things, but he wouldn't be able to give them orders, that's just dumb, but he does when it suits the meandering plot.Over long, overly serious and ultimately disappointing. The effects are good, but they're the usual high end computer Paint Box fare that are blatantly not actually there.If you're easily impressed and don't care about logic or any characterization or depth, you may still enjoy this.","

"harry_tk_yung","23 May 2014","While verdicts of many major film critics are not yet out at the time of this posting, the fact that this X-men ""convergence"" has won a resounding approval (8.9 rating) from some 17,000 IMDb users to-date is not surprising. I use the word convergence to denote the two separate time frames in which the X-men movies have appeared: the initial story set in the present (loosely defined) on the one hand, and time of the 1962 Cuban Crisis on the other when the two nemesis were young men. This convergence takes up both time frames: the continuation of the ""present"" when the mutants are facing the risk of total annihilation and the year 1973 to which Logan is sent back to try to save the day by changing the future. Sounds familiar? You've seen it all, the best of which is ""Back to the future"".While the basic premise is familiar, the work done with it is clever, with good attention to details. The plot is simple and uncontrived, makes sense, and works. Don't be overwhelmed by the alarming proliferation of characters. Focus on the few key ones – the rest are almost like animation, although not in a literal sense. The new enemy, potential annihilator of the mutant species, is called Sentinels: robots developed with one single-minded agenda – identify, hunt down and kill all mutants. Sentinels were developed back in the 1970s by Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Ironically, the successful assassination of Trask led to the immediate capture of assassin Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), the analysis of whose genetic makeup became instrumental to the perfection of Sentinels. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Gandolfsorry, I mean Ian McKellen), joining force in the mutant's last stand, commission Kitty Pryde (lovely Ellen Page) to send Logan (whatsisname again?) back to find and persuade the pair back then (James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr) to stop the assassination. If successful, this would remake history - Sentinels would never progress beyond the prototype stage and nobody would remember anything about the alternative, sinister time line. This time-travel here is a tricky concept. What is sent back is actually Logan's ""consciousness"" from the present, to sort of ""possess"" his body back in 1973. Why Logan? He is the only one who can survive the ordeal of this decades-spanning time travel, and any worthy follower of the X-men or Wolverine story knows why. Just one more thing: if this works, Logan is the only person who will remember what happened.No more needs to be said about the plot. What I have not elaborated on are just details that enhance the texture of this basic plot. The two key set pieces, as can be easily surmised, are the titanic battle against the Sentinels in the present time frame and culminating assassination scene back in 1973. Towards the end of the movie, they converge and cross-cut in a totally predictable fashion.I mentioned the proliferation of characters, mostly mutants, both new and old. I am only going to mention two additional ones. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets almost as much screen time as the key characters, as the only company kept by Xavier (details omitted here). The other one is Evan Peters as Quicksilver, not so much for the character as for one specific scene with Jim Croce's all-time hall-of-fame classic ""Time in a bottle"" as background music (details omitted here). There is a lot more, old and new, all tremendous fun to watch.This movie has a lot of everything in it (characters, stories, situations), although none with any real depth. That it is hugely entertaining is amply demonstrated in the aforementioned IMDb user rating. To some, probably, the mere special effects are worth it.","

"XweAponX","1 October 2014","The first time this storyline from the comics was used, was in the great 1992 X-Men Cartoon. I suppose there were a couple other cartoon renditions of this as well, but those were not worth mentioning- The '92 Saban X-Men series did a fantastic job of rendering the Core X- Men and animating the tales which kept us saying ""Make Mine Marvel"" and ""Nuff Said"" all these years.Finally, at long last, we have this story told in Live Action. Well, Live Action and some masterfully done SFX.No one can doubt that Hugh Jackman has brought James ""Logan"" Wolverine to more life than any other cartoon rendition of the character, and even in the Comics his antics are always what you are drawn to. He's the best as what he does, and what he does ain't pretty, as he always reminds us.The graphic image of Wolverine in Mid-Flight, Adamantium Claws Extended - The Iconic Image of Wolverine which is on one of the covers of the 1982 limited series, was shown in ""The Wolverine"" (On top of the Bullet Train), and his ""fastball Special"" was shown in The Danger Room scene in X-3, The Last Stand. So, what's left? Plenty: Just keep your eye on Bobby ""Iceman"", in X-3 he Iced Up Solid, in this he is finally able to do the stuff he can from the books.One enigmatic figure from the comics had never made it into the films: ""Bishop"" (Omar Sy) - Other characters from the 'X-Force' side-team are also here, Sunspot (Adan Canto), Warpath (Booboo Stewart), and Bishop's Sister ""Blink"" (Bingbing Fan, in the comics she is actually deceased, and she appears as a Hologram from Bishop's Armband). So we have a nod to X-factor here are well.The Original story had Kitty Pryde (Ms Ellen Page) as the one who this story revolved around, and Wolverine was actually Killed by the Modern Sentinels. In retrospect that story would not have worked as well as this, because of Wolverine's Central importance to the storyline that had been told starting from the first X-Men film.Some of the other particulars have been changed as well, mostly to use concepts (And characters/actors) from X-Men: First Class - So mainly this was a unique opportunity to use two sets of actors for Magneto and Professor X. The only thing that is a problem, is that Patrick Stewart had appeared as a Walking Elder Professor X in ""X- Men Origins: Wolverine"" - And Xavier had lost use of his legs at the end of ""First Class"". But if you watch this film. you will see why it is not a problem: This film deals once again with Alternate Histories and Universes. This seems to be a common concept used in many media lately, most notably in ""Fringe"" which had ""Red and Blue Universes"". In a way, we have this happening in the X-Men Franchise, and if my guess is correct, the next X-Film will deal with the ""Age of Apocalypse"" which is a total mind-bender: IN fact Marvel changed the name of all of their major comics for six months while that story played out.What is great to see always is another appearance/cameo by Mike Dopud, who was notable for playing at least 6 different guys in the Stargate Franchise. He has appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well as in X-2, hes just one of those faces that shows up in Hugh Jackman movies. Look for him here, in ""1973"".This film has Wolverine living in a Split-Level Head: One head in the Present (2025 or so) and the other in 1973, so the action literally spans 50 years. Despite the changes to the story from the comics, this film connects all of the X-Men franchise films in a way I had not thought possible, and as much as I respect the work of the other directors, it took Bryan Singer to pull all the strings back together. IN my view, is was a huge mistake for him to go off- mission to make ""Superman Returns""- A movie that should have been made in 1980, which was actually made in 1978, but the scenes Marlon Brando had shot were simply not used in their proper context- Having Bryan direct that was not the best use of his talents, as X-3 suffered for it. Not that I did not enjoy X-3, Magneto picks up the San Francisco Bay Bridge and lays it across to Alcatraz... In this film, the younger Magneto does something almost as amazing. What was better, Magneto moving the Bay Bridge, or Superman moving a huge Kryptonite Continent? What we see here, makes those titanic events seem small in comparison.Between X-3 and this film, we were shown just how powerful Magneto is, and that Jean Grey was even more so.In this franchise, we've seen Magneto move bridges, Jean Grey Vaporize people, Logan regrow skin as fast as Jean could strip him of it, and Charles Xavier take habitation of his Brain Dead Half- Brother's Body. Prepare to see much, much more in this latest installment, and be prepared for the coming Apocalyptic Age, cos ""El Nabin Sur"" is coming.","

"aldri-feb","21 May 2014","At first, the idea to unite the old and new face of X-Men team is brilliant but could be risky too. Thankfully Bryan Singer knows what he's doing and seems comfortable with the material it has, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" never get confused or lost with bunch of mutant character and always focus to the main topic. All top form casts are placed where it should be and given almost same portion on each significant character while the plot itself is nicely structured and the future-past time are neatly set. The mixed of action-drama-comedy are put in a right place and never reduce fun factor this movie offers. A hilarious escape scene, thoughtful yet compelling time twisted storyline guided with charismatic performance by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, all ended with stunning action climax, it's a first class entertainment which the fans and non fans of X-men franchise are expecting. Overall ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is an elegant, emotional, entertaining action-packed that is worth to see at any season. And once again Bryan Singer proves himself as an X-Men specialty. He succeeded to bring nostalgia from the original X-Men casts and give more chances for younger member to shine by continuing the respected-solid foundation that Matthew Vaughn had created. It is the X-Men series that audiences have missed since ""X2"" and got potential to be the most remarkable superhero movie this year.","

I ended up leaving, thinking it was possibly my favourite X-Men movie.Rewatching it, for only the third time today, I still had the same initial thought, and the same thought at the end.
I have to applaud this series of movies for hitting some interesting social and political hot zones. I love both versions of Charles and Eric, but I prefer Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique over Rebecca Romijn. I really enjoyed Quicksilver too. The kitchen scene in The Pentagon is a real highlight.The movie also has an excellent villain in Game Of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, playing a mutant-hating arms manufacturer with an awful name Bolivar Trask.

"jadongarcia","12 March 2019","Probably the best X-Men film ever. Everything that was done in this film was unequivocally perfect in terms of a comicbook film, it is basically the infinity war of X-men.The visuals were perfect, they obviously aren't the main attraction in the film but they were more than sufficient, from the sentinels to the fire scenes to the levitating stadium, everything, it was all so great.The performance and the impact of the message that both Xavier and Magneto had overall was exquisite. The best pieces of this film that complete it are the speech scenes. You also get a perfect blend of action and such a great score with this film being in the hands of Bryan Singer. Although the plot is very familiar to James Cameron's Terminator: Judgement Day with a shapeshifter that threatens the outcome of a particular species. It obviously isn't anything new but for an xmen film plot it is absolutely genius.This is definetely up there with Watchmen, The Dark Knight, etc. Truly an ambitious comicbook film. Just when you thought xmen films were slowly tipping the scale to a decline Singer really went all out on this one.","

"davidmvining","13 April 2021","This is probably the best the X-Men franchise is going to get, especially considering the ensemble approach most of the films take. I think there's some unfocused storytelling going on that keeps it a hair's breadth away from greatness, but overall this is the best balancing act the franchise ever pulled off, managing two different casts and timelines with shocking style and seeming ease. Bryan Singer really brought his A-game, making possibly his best movie here.This franchise fits best together when you don't think about it too hard, keeping up generalities about relationships in mind without demanding specifics. In a surprisingly bold move, the movie starts by skipping ahead into the future to give us the X-Men version of a Terminator future where mutants are chased down by Sentinels that can detect them, adapt to their powers, and easily dispatch them if caught. The opening is nearly on par with the Nightcrawler attack on the White House that opened X2 in terms of cinematically introducing the audience to the world and the threat. This is a shockingly good action scene with almost no dialogue to explain who's what, the stakes, or the overall purpose, but it's still amazingly good edge of your seat entertainment with a handful of very specific goals: the danger of the Sentinels, the overall world, the minor characters, and the basic power that they will use to send Wolverine back in time.In 1973 Mystique killed a man named Bolivar Trask who was developing a mutant hunting weapon called the Sentinel. The assassination convinced the world that anti-mutant weapons were the best course of action instead of stopping development, and decades later they perfected and implemented the weapons, creating the dystopian vision the movie starts in. Professor Xavier, Magneto, Storm, and Wolverine find our minor characters led by Iceman and Kitty Pride in order to use Kitty's power of sending a person's consciousness into their younger self, how they were able to undo the attack that started the film. The plan would be to send Xavier back to 1973, but the length of time would be particularly difficult on the physical body, something his elderly frame couldn't take, so they send back Wolverine, ageless and able to heal instantly. Now, all of this is explained very quickly through clunky exposition, its only saving grace being that it's done so quickly. We don't have a couple of ten minute long scenes to explain it, it all comes out in a couple of minutes and then we're off. So, I can wish all day long that it was explained more elegantly, but at least it's done quickly.Sent back in time, Logan searches out Xavier who is taking a serum to suppress his powers and give him the ability to walk at the same time. Guarded and accompanied by Beast, who takes the same serum to suppress his new blue visage, Xavier has become jaded from his mission after the saving of the world from nuclear war at the end of First Class only led to a temporary understanding with humans and the Vietnam War robbed him of many of his teachers and students. Disillusioned, he refuses to listen to Wolverine at first, but mentioning Xavier's childhood friend, Raven/Mystique, is enough to get him out of the house. In order to convince her, though, they decide that they need to free Magneto from his prison several hundred feet below the Pentagon. In order to do that, Wolverine points them in the direction of Peter Maximoff, a young man in 1973 that Wolverine knew as an older man in the future but is a kleptomaniac youth who can run faster than the eye can see.The breakout is a fantastic sequence, told with energy and humor. It's the absolute standout moment of the movie as Xavier and Beast mess with the video surveillance, Maximoff takes a guard uniform, speeds Magneto from his cell, and then takes out a room full of guards as they fire guns at the group in a kitchen with the sprinkler system on. The use of ""Time in a Bottle"" fits perfectly with the scene, also providing an auditory counterpoint to the action that helps sell the comedic aspects of what's going on.This movie does a better job of including the overall political climate than First Class did. Trask is brought into a Senate hearing early. Xavier is jaded by Vietnam. Trask goes to Paris to participate in the Paris Peace Accords where Mystique plans on assassinating him, needing to use her ability to mimic people by copying a Vietnamese general. The mutant team arrives just in time, and Magneto just has the most amazing moments. He bend a bullet's path to shoot Raven in the leg. He uses the bullet in her leg to drag her towards him. He's going to kill her to protect their future. I'm a broken record on this, but Michael Fassbender is the best casting choice made in the X-Men movies.Everything comes to a head in DC where, at the same time in the future, the Sentinels have found the mutant hideout and both confrontations happen at the same ""time"". Now, that's just solid story construction right there, but it falls apart slightly on a second viewing. First of all, Magneto pulling Robert F. Kennedy Stadium up off the ground, flying it over to the White House, and plopping it around the Executive Mansion to cut off any police or military support from the ground while he uses the first generation Sentinels to provide air support is just great stuff. Xavier using his powers to plea with Raven as she gets within striking distance of Trask, who's on stage with President Nixon, is very good. Wolverine, though, he doesn't have a whole lot to do, and when Magneto throws him away from the scene into the Potomac River he's done with the scene. Where this ends up mattering is how it interacts with the future segment as the mutants steadily lose ground and people to the incoming threat. It's unclear at what point Wolverine has set the future on the right course, but it's long before Kitty Pride breaks the connection with him. His lack of involvement in the third act where he is a lynchpin of dramatic tension undermines that really well done third act a bit.Every character is going through different emotional arcs that aren't really related. Xavier is learning to re-embrace his powers after being jaded. Raven is learning that violence won't solve everything. Wolverine is learning, well, not much. The movie's focus isn't on these journeys and they're done well enough on their own, all tied together through the machinations of the plot so we never feel like they're unrelated scenes just plopped in out of nowhere, but I can wish that they were more in line with each other thematically. However, in a big spectacle driven action movie, that's not a huge problem at all when the focus is mainly elsewhere.Overall, this is a rousing fun time at the movies. An intelligently constructed adventure through time that uses special effects and action filmmaking tools to propel the audience the whole way through the two hour experience. This is comic book filmmaking on a grand scale, and while it may not be perfect, it's really enjoyable.","

"tadpole-596-918256","24 May 2014",". . . the first thing I'd want to do is to put together a ""mix tape"" (to use 1970s lingo) of this slow-motion scene from X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and the parallel segments from writer\director Sean Ellis' wonderful 2006 flick CASHBACK. Like all the Marvel movies, this one is over-the-top. If you think you can explain the plot well enough to make FUTURE PAST seem internally consistent to someone else, you're spending Waaaaay too much time in the Marvel Universe. However, just as Grandpa or Great-Grandpa expected eye-popping set pieces from the James Bond films of the 1960s and the 1970s, that's what America's Future demands of Marvel movies today, and FUTURE PAST does NOT disappoint. If I was in charge of a corner of Marvel Universe big enough to make one tiny improvement to FUTURE PAST, it would be to rename the stadium Magneto levitates in Washington, DC, as the home of the ""Washington Mutants"" National Football League franchise. But that's just me.","

"djangozelf","14 September 2014","I can understand fans wanting it to stay loyal to the comic book but there u got the luxury of spreading it out over more episodes and the plots will work better with the cliffhangers used in comic books so that you buy the next one.Also these where written years ago and mostly for kids who now watch movies they can relate to like 'Hunger games' and 'Divergent' which I did not like because they make everything either black or white with no real nuances.A lot of characters where week in this film and the constant struggle between Xavier and Magneto became to much of a drag in this movie.The way they explained the time travel principal was close to ridiculous and it all seemed like a sort of doubling up the first x-men movie.Also the fact that it dismisses a lot of the other movies marvel made makes you really wonder if anyone at marvel is actually paying attention to all these franchises.And hey...if they do not care than why should I?I stopped before with other franchises like""twilight"" and""The Hobbit""because they where way to predictable and after watching part 2 of both of these I could have written the final installment myself and x-men D.O.F.P. is not much better.I am hoping for more of the avengers type movies and the second captain America cause I think there more character driven than this sad imitation of other marvel movies who are all better than this.At the end of the third installment of the original X-men movie I feared that at some point it would create an overkill and Ironman 3 confirmed that and now so does this one.So....marvel make less and make it better so it stays interesting for everybody and worthwhile to care for and keep watching everything you marvel us with.Stay Marvelous!","

"dfranzen70","25 May 2014","X-Men: Days of Future Past sort of blew me away. And here's the kicker - you don't need to have seen the previous movies in the series to understand what's going on. There's an unerring blend of past and present characters, real heart-in-your-throat tension, and stunning effects. Yeah, so I sort of liked it a little bit.I don't mean to fawn, but sometimes it's appropriate. This is a great movie. In a nutshell, here's your story. It's sometime in the future (2029? not sure). The Sentinels, robots built with the sole purpose of eradicating all mutants, are on the rampage, tracking said mutants down and slaughtering them, full stop. In fact, they've become so advanced that when a mutant defends against/attacks a Sentinel, that mutant's powers are absorbed by that Sentinel. Get it? It's a bad scene. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellan), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and other assorted X people have holed up in the middle of nowhere, awaiting their doom. Xavier believes that the only way to stop the war on mutants (and on sympathetic humans, by the way, in case you missed the analogy) is to travel back in time to prevent the creation of the Sentinels in 1973. Now, Professor X wants to be sent back (don't worry, Kitty Pryde is on the job), but because of the long time period between '73 and the present, Pryde thinks the journey would snap even the Professor's mind. Instead, they opt to send Wolverine back, because he's essentially unchanged from 1973 (more-or- less ageless, really) and would therefore adjust better to the trip. And so back he goes.A solo, rogue mission by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), in an effort to destroy Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels, merely gave the public and the government cause to turn on the mutants, thus sparking the war. So: Wolverine is to locate Mystique and persuade her to give up her cause, and he won't be able to do so without the help of...the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Aye, there's the rub, huh? Older, wiser Magneto regrets fighting Charles Xavier all those years, but younger, angrier Magneto isn't so shrewd. (They're just like people!)So there's your setup. Young Magneto is being held secretly about 100 stories below the Pentagon in a super-ultra-mega-maximum security cell for the murder of...well, never mind. Young Xavier, on the other hand, is hiding out at his School for Gifted Youngsters, which no longer is a school nor houses youngsters, except for Beast, who helps his mentor faithfully. Thus the movie unites not only good mutants and bad mutants but younger and older versions of themselves, more or less. And because of the trippy time shenanigans, you could possibly see familiar mutants, from movies other than the First Class one. Sounds like this would make for a crowded cast, but the action centers around the younger Magneto and Xavier, Mystique, Wolverine, and the younger Beast (Nicholas Hoult). It feels so good to have Bryan Singer back behind the wheel. The story flows in sync with the dazzling, but not distracting, effects, as if a steady-handed auteur was in charge. This feels like the most authentic and personal X-Men film to date, and I (yeah, yeah) liked each of the others. And heaven forfend if I bust out a spoiler, but you know what they say about time-travel movies: they can change things, man.","

"MikeM1984","23 May 2014","After seeing this movie I tried to compare it to others I had seen, as I often do. I usually find most of the ones I watch to finish somewhere below the traditional greats: X2, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, Avengers, Superman...until now. I'll have to see it a few more times before the novelty wears off but that may have been the best superhero film I have ever seen. And I stress the word ""film"" because that's the only way I can describe a movie with so many emotional beats, such strong subtext, so many layers, so much complexity and so many gut wrenching moments.From watching Mystique review autopsy files, to painfully watching the X-Men graphically die in a lynch mob of Sentinels can not be describes in comparison to other superhero movies. They felt less like scenes from another cape-inspired summer blockbuster and more like scenes from Schlinder's List.The movie also does an excellent job of being an allegory for racism; the trump card X-Men holds over all other heroes. It means something. Unlike Batman who is a rich playboy, or Iron Man who is a rich playboy or Spider-Man who is a broke supposedly hard luck case who none the less bags tons of pretty ladies, or Cap who is a universally loved war hero, the X-Men are outcasts. As the movie so perfectly depicts, they're lives are not perfect. These characters don't fall into normal caricatures of ""good"" and ""bad"". Everyone is a mix, everyone is broken.There's no pretty girl for them to impress, most of them are not surrounded by wealth and all of them are normal faces who blend into the crowd but are not part of the crowd. The movie makes you feel truly sorry for that.There is no superhero formula in this movie. The good guys don't necessarily ""win"", the bad guys don't even ""lose"". Even with a future averted, the future still is not set. And it leaves you with the feeling that maybe this never ends, and there is more to come. Much more.","

"videodrome1234","21 May 2014","It's not too out there to say that the x-men series is in a rut. First off the 3rd part of the original trilogy was lacking something, but was still okay Then came X-men first class, that was good on in a lot of ways, but was also filled with mistakes. Despite the fact that Fox was looking to make a romantic-comedy-action for teenagers the end result wasn't that bad. But to me it did succeed in – despite the great actors – making me like the new foundation x-men was set on. Then came the worst installment of the x-men saga Wolverine. I think the whole brand reached its lowest point with that film, despite the fact that it's a watchable film, but it was by far the worst of them all. Of course the films make money but Avengers proved that there is a whole lot more money to be made still with comic book films. Of course Fox wanted a piece of the pie too, but I'm sure they knew that you need quality to make lots of money, so they invested a lot and secured Bryan Singer for the director's chair. He was already around to produce and write First Class but this time around he got control of the whole film. Fox then okayed the x-men series most complex story for the film. Thought the script was written by Simon Kinberg, who already fell short with the 3 part back in the day but for some reason Singer trusted him with it. First off the film is good, maybe even the best yet. Of course the biggest question everyone has been asking is will it give the Avengers a run for its money and that's a harder question to answer. Compared to other comic book adaptations and other Marvel films the two are very different, so it's hard to compare them, but I have to point out the quality wise it's up there with Ironman. I don't think that it will be there money wise. They did rewrite the original story from the comic book, but that didn't cause problems. I was mostly worried about how they would sew the 5 x-men films together but that was done perfectly. So the story is okay. As is the script. There are humorous parts, but they aren't over the top. Just enough. The actors are genius, none of them forgot how to act since the previous installments. This was a give though cause the casting was always super. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is so good, that it almost becomes his one man show. I maybe just expected a little more from Peter Dinklage. Let's look at the other characters, as opposed to the other films Wolverine isn't completely in the main focus, and the funny thing is that this isn't a problem. Magneto, Xavier and Mystic step up to the plate, but just to sooth the fans he doesn't fade into the background. But this still brings us to one of the problems, there is not enough time for all the characters; It's one team but two time zones, some characters got larger roles like Mystic, and a few were left to fade away, but Singer manage to fix this problem, way better than with x-men 2 by having huge action scenes in the film. They are done well and are brutal. So we don't really have time to get into which characters are lost in the background. You're just whiplashed by the action, action that is not the least bit pointless. There is always a believable story behind each one. All in all it's a step forward from First Class, and it was a quality step too. It's not just a 5th part. Which is huge. So I give it a 9/10 Max - https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1","

X-Men is a beloved title. The X-Men spinoffs are beloved. Days of Future Past is one of the X-Stories that gets crowned time and again by us nerds.Singer walked in there knowing that if he messed it up he'd be lynched by fanboys and that is an extremely embarrassing way to go. There are certainly more painful ways to die, but few that are more humiliating than death-by-fan-boy.Thankfully he did pull it off. He adapted it nicely to fit into the established chronology of the X-Franchise and he did with style and grace.You get glimpses of favorite characters, epic battles in the future, the return of characters we loved from the original franchise, a fun romp through the 70s and, just because he is THE fan favorite, Logan gets to time travel instead of Kitty. Besides, neither this Shadowcat nor Ellen Page have ever seen the 70s.And to top it all off you get a fun new character. Sure, Quicksilver was more true to form in Age of Ultron, but the X-Franchise version of him is utterly entertaining.It is a win on all counts.Unfortunately, like X2, it's the sequel that stands out before the reboot does a Last Stand swan dive into horrible.So, as with X2, if you are going to watch one X-Reboot, watch Days of Future past. 10 out of 10, pure geeky entertainment.","

There are some ridiculous expository dialog at the beginning, some dull scenes such as when Charles(James MacVoy) punches Magneto in the face when he first see him in the elevator. I mean, what? It didn't make any sense.Also, Raven changing her body in public, where everyone could spot her. Really? So freaking dull. Also, it's impossible to deny the inconsistency of logic in the saga so far. And the plot is basically a rip-off of every successful Sci Fi film ever made. For example, the plot is almost a carbon copy of The Matrix. Just replace time-travel with a computer generated reality, and wham. And the ending is ripped off from Inception. Even the music score is similar.But obviously, there are good thing music s about it.mFor example, QuickSilver character is probably the most awesome of the film, and despite having few screen time, he is in one of the best scenes in the film. Also, Peter Dinklage was surprisingly good. There are some memorable scenes in the film to keep the average viewer entertained.So yeah, is probably my biggest let down of the year. Expectes much more from this film. Worth watching, but don't expect a 'The Dark Knight' quality.7/10","

"jaesqueda","25 May 2014","X Men was one of the first movies about comics during last decade.The cartoon show on TV was amazing, but we need see it at movies. The mix between stories about X Men was marvelous. The contrast color between future and present is other character in this movie.All actors are BIG. Filled with action, but a very good story, and mixing mutant activities with human history. The photography is very good, the music too. The participation of Peter Dinklage is the spice in this movie. You need to see it. And the final scene pots credits is....When the movie comes to end, you want to see more, and more, and more","

"rgkarim","24 May 2014","Happy Memorial day weekend my friends, and what better way to welcome the weekend than with another movie review. Today we cover the new X-men movie, a series which over the last 14 years has split into three story arcs that has led to a mixture of receptions. Yet director Bryan Singer has returned to the project to hopefully clean the mess others have made, hopefully returning the spark the first two movies held. Did it work? Read on to find out.From the trailers, X-men Days of Futures Past is a time traveling adventure that sends the rugged Wolverine back into the past to meet up with the youthful, though distraught, X- men. The goal of this mission is to stop the construction of the legendary mutant hunting sentinels, and prevent a dark future from arising that could mean the end of humanity. I know a bit cliché, but despite the stale time traveling story line the latest X-men feature has a lot of great qualities. We'll start with the acting. Days of Future Past has a lot of characters that fans will recognize and perhaps be excited to see. Hugh Jackman has stepped back into the Wolverine role, still bringing the tough guy with a big heart and even bigger edge back to the screen. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles as young X and magneto, bringing back some of their chemistry, while bringing other qualities to their characters. Of course most are interested in Ms. Popularity herself, Jennifer Lawrence, playing the young, and deadly, Mystique. Of all the characters, she has the broadest emotional spectrum, which Lawrence once again brings to life in her typical fashion that makes many lover her. The rest of the group does well, but due to space limitations and the fact they are secondary, I'll move on. Despite the story being just another time traveling tale, X-men Days of Future Past has great delivery to pull it off well. The first twenty minutes set the stage in an explosive opening, setting the pace and time limit of the movie. Once back in the past, Wolverine sets out to accomplish his goals, bringing in the rest of the crew gradually. This is where Singer's work speaks for itself as he somehow reveals more of his character's, while still keeping the film moving. I didn't see too many scenes where the mission had to stop while the group had a heart to heart *cough Batman *cough. As these characters changed, for better or for worse, the story twisted, keeping the plot fresh and more unpredictable than some of the tales in the past. It was great trying to figure out what the characters would do next, wondering how far some of the mutants would go to destroy the evil without throwing the events further into chaos. Of course, there are plenty of hints that take away from the surprise that, if you pay attention, will help you predict what is coming next, with a few exceptions of course.Yet the thing I really loved about this movie was how balanced everything was. Singer once again brought a blend of traits to his project that was done in the appropriate amounts. The comedic timing was top notch, having both old, new, and X-men reference styles present that were not overdone nor rubbed in my face. Drama was spread out evenly, not focusing on one character's drama for too long nor was it focused on a single type of drama (i.e. just on romantic affairs), keeping me interested instead of asking when will this end. Even the action was done well, with the opening getting the pace of the movie started, and ending with heated excitement to wrap up the intense story line. Such balance is key to many movies my friends, and something that many other genres lack. Of course there is no perfect movie, and X-men does have a few flaws for me. While they did a great job tying the three stories together, Singer and company had a few story stretches that were a bit too far-fetched for me. The explanation for how Xavier could walk, or how the X-men could so easily sneak about were just two examples. Another flaw included how some of the characters, primarily first class, were written off, requiring some close attention to detail to determine their fate. I know there are probably good reasons for this approach, but they best be careful for their next films to avoid any conflict. As for the action, while very balanced I wanted more. Special effects wise it was great, but the scenes lacked some excitement, and were surprisingly shorter than I had anticipated from the trailers. Overall Days of Future Past was one of, if not the best X-men movie I've seen. All three stories are integrated into a tale that will keep you on the edge, and is one of those suspenseful movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a balanced plot line, well done action, and some great acting, fans of the series may have their faith restored that this series can be good. Yes they still have some things to work on, but I trust that the next movie can be just as good, especially with the end of the credits scene. Just make sure to bring Singer back for that as well!Score overall: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie overall: 8.5","

"Seraphion","26 May 2014","The story follows Wolverine as his mind is sent back through time, using Kitty Pride's powers, into his old body to stop a losing war between mutants and the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels. He then finds and convinces young Charles/Professor X and Hank/Beast to help him. Charles is able to walk by taking Beast's serum, in exchange of temporarily losing his mutant powers. Aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik/Magneto from his concrete prison. Logan tells the group that the war starts from the moment Raven/Mystique kills Trask, the scientist who designs the Sentinels. The group catches Raven just as she's about to kill Trask and her cover is blown. Trask escapes and Erik shoots Raven to prevent anyone getting her DNA that can help Sentinels against the mutants. Hank disrupts Erik but he manages to fire and hit Raven. Logan sees Stryker in the room and he goes haywire, injuring Kitty in the present. Erik keeps on hunting Raven, as bystanders watch in horror, but Beast tackles Erik as Raven escapes. Erik manages to escape after subduing Beast. People panicked at the sight of mutant powers in public and Trask wins funding for the Sentinels. Raven ambushes Erik, but Erik tells her Trask has gotten her DNA from the blood on the street. When Logan's group reaches home, Charles goes ill as he needs the serum. Logan convinces Charles not to take it and to read his mind, by which the old and young Charles converse. Erik slips into the Sentinel shipment and reconfigure the non-metal Sentinels into having metals. Charles locates Raven but fails to stop her. Logan's group then goes to the Sentinel launching event in the White House to stop her. Erik goes to the same venue. Logan's group arrives then Charles locates and subdues Raven. Suddenly the Sentinels, under Erik's control, turns on and go haywire so the VIPs flee to a vault bunker. Erik then drops a stadium around the White House, pinning Charles in the debris. Erik yanks the vault up. At the present, fighting also rages on and the mutants slowly but surely losing their ground, dying one by one. Logan and Hank attacks Erik, but he sends a Sentinel on them. Hank handles the Sentinel, but Erik incapacitates Logan, tying him with metal bars then throws him into the river. Erik then rips open the vault and makes a speech about the mutant world order. Raven, disguised as the President goes out from the vault and challenges Erik. Hank patches his serum and the Sentinel goes from him into targeting Erik and Raven. Erik disjoints the robot and Raven shoot him and removes his helmet. Charles then subdues Erik but Raven aims then gun to Trask. Charles reasons with her. As the present Sentinels fire beams to kill the remaining Logan and Kitty, they all disappear. Raven yields in, dropping the gun thus altering the future. Logan wakes up in the present Xavier school, seeing all those who have died still live. He meets Charles and Charles realizes that it is the Logan from the past and begins explaining what Logan has missed from the past to this altered reality.The base story is just exceptionally great. Though it's not as epic as other sci-fi gems, but it's able to present a complex story without differing from the original comics story characteristics. It is by far the first movie to successfully marry the concepts of super-powers and time-travel in one story and executes the story greatly. The movie also offer some epic moments, some never before seen in any movie. I personally liked the Quicksilvers resonating hands and of course Magneto's stadium drop. The dialog contains many catchy comments. I liked Magneto's words to Logan as seeing his claws ""Imagine that with metal"" that sounded just as vividly as a premonition of what is to come.One thing that's not so satisfying is that the movie looks to be too limited by a duration length target that it doesn't spare any character development on any of the newly appearing mutants. I just hope that they get more spotlight in the next movie.There is little to complain about the acting. A-list cast of stars is a great choice in doing this movie. The parts composition for each characters is great, able to showcase the senior talents in enough duration and at the same time still keeping the younger and newer talents to keep the lead roles. Hugh Jacman's Logan is an exception on this though, due to his character have a great relevance to the story's technical aspect.The score department is good that is helps to build the scenes' mood well, keeping the focus at the characters and without being overbearing. The costumes and set department did great in reliving the 1970s era in the movie, though unfortunately, there's not much scenes that focus on things that are particularly special to that era.From me, I'm glad to say that this is one of the most deserving 8 out of 10 scoring movie this year, and a recommendation is an absolute certain yes. I watched this in the streaming sites, and will definitely watch this again on DVD or any other higher quality medias.","

"haosstoposto","29 September 2014","X-Men - Days of the Future Past excels in every aspect. It has a clever story (which is a hard thing to do in a time-travel movie), superb action and suspense. Basicaly it is a mixture between the Terminator and Matrix, our heroes try to manipulate the past in order to achieve some better future for the almost-extinct mutants and the oppressed mankind. And the future is grim indeed, and visually fascinating. The mutants have been hunted down because Homo Sapiens in its fight for survival in the evolutionary process managed to create super-robots which are able to confront superpowers. The battle scenes between the Sentinels (robots programmed to hunt down mutants) and the remaining X-Men are stunning. X-Men are facing a lost cause and that way we have some real suspense on the screen. In every battle before, ordinary humans have been only a cannon fodder, but with the sentinels all bets are off. As for the time travel story, our remaining heroes sent Wolwerines conscience in his young body to try to prevent the creation of super robots and perhaps to save a soul of the shape-shifting mutant Raven/Mystique. The story background in the seventies is very cool and of course it is a good thing that we have some different languages in the movie. I always found irritating that in the most movies we don't hear foreign languages, but have bad English with a foreign accent. Nacis are best example for that. This time everything fits together and as a result we have excellent movie. And it is always a pleasure to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen share a screen, this time as allies. Go and see it, you will not regret it.","

"praveenalienstar","16 June 2014","For those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie will make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole movie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after the time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful sentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that you might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured in 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can Magneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A Football stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine would never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end of movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4. Finally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men 1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets killed? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the public is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based x-men story they make.","

"kosmasp","20 September 2014","And when I say cheating I'm not only talking about moments where things are not logical anymore (logical in the realm of what we get served that is, not logical as in the ""real"" world), but also story-wise. If you watch it through, you'll know what I mean. On the other hand it's nice to put a lid on some things ... or quite a couple of things. Or closing a circle ... or whatever you want to call it.So whatever your take on that is (head shaking or nod of approval), will decide how you'll receive this movie. Technically there is nothing to criticize and the story (if not depicted and torn apart for logical errors), is more than entertaining enough to hold you to the edge of your seat. If you've seen the other movies, you'll love how this comes together, even if your favorite character might not get as much screen time as you thought/hoped he/she would get. Great moments and superhero movies have arrived a long time ago. And they'll continue, one way or the other. Rejoice or be afraid ;o)","

"moviexclusive","22 May 2014","Slightly more than a decade after setting the gold standard of the Fox/ Marvel franchise he successfully launched, Bryan Singer is back at the helm of perhaps its most ambitious entry yet. Conceived by the previous instalment's screenwriter Simon Kinberg, it attempts to merge two separate timelines with two sprawling casts - the Patrick Stewart/Ian McKellen gang from the first 'X-Men' trilogy;, and the younger generation, led by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, from 2011's 'X- Men: First Class' – by introducing the tricky element of time travel. The result is in a word - extraordinary - combining the best from two different teams for an exhilarating adventure across time.As Stewart solemnly intones at the beginning, a years-long war between the mutants and an army of near-indestructible robots known as Sentinels has devastated the world, resulting in a terrifying dystopian future where mutants and mutant-sympathizing humans have been rounded up in internment camps. Gathered with Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) against the Sentinel threat are familiars Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), as well as some new additions including Bishop (Omar Sy), Blink (Fan Bingbing), and Warpath (Booboo Stewart).The one hope to their survival lies back in the past - or more precisely, the year 1973 - where Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) assassination of Sentinel creator Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) will not only cement the humans' suspicion of the mutants as a threat but also lead to her capture and the use of her shape-shifting DNA into the design of the robots. Logan/ Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) ability to heal makes him the only suitable candidate for travelling back in time - his mission to convince the younger Professor X (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) to put aside their differences in order to avert the killing that would change the course of history.That's a fair bit of exposition to set up the events that follow, but Singer knows just how to keep the pacing nimble. Showing that he has lost none of his touch for inventive action sequences, Singer unfurls an opening that leverages largely on Blink's powers of teleportation to deliver some truly eye-popping action. Indeed, action is pretty much the language of the movie, which plays to the strengths and powers of the individual characters to move the plot forwards. Wisely though, he eschews the need to build gigantic setpieces in favour of more intimately scoped ones – and of these, the most singularly impressive is that of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), whose superhuman speed gets a stimulating demonstration in bullet-time while on a prison-bust within the Pentagon.That sequence is also an excellent case-in-point of one of the X-factors of his original entries which Singer brings back to the franchise, levity. Most prominently, Quicksilver's brief entry in the franchise (chiefly due to rights issues) is played for maximum comic slapstick – but thankfully without ever tipping into caricature. Singer knows always how to stay on the right side of cool, and despite the catastrophic peril facing our characters, keeps the tone lively and effervescent. It isn't just Singer's credit of course; some of the most light-hearted moments of the film belong to Jackman, who oozes charisma and wryness as he is called to play mentor to the younger Professor X and his student Beast (Nicholas Hoult) in a clear reversal of roles. And yet the one most important element which Singer retains is the humanity of these characters. The struggle between the humans and the mutants has always been at the heart of the best of these movies as well as the comics, meant of course as an allegory to the discriminated and marginalised within our very society by virtue of the fact of them being different from the majority. Here, that struggle becomes even more pronounced with Logan's warning of just what the future holds, exacerbating the ideological differences between Professor X and Magneto as well as their battle for the heart and mind of Mystique as a crucial piece in the chess game of fate.Kinberg's plotting deserves special mention here, juggling multiple time streams and alternate futures effortlessly without ever breaking a sweat. He even manages to contain the inherent logical gaps in time travel, and in the grander scheme of the franchise, forges an exciting way forward for future instalments while respecting the events of the first three movies. Both Kinberg and Singer are also clearly invigorated recreating period here, as they redefine the assassination of JFK, recreate the voice and visage of Richard Nixon (played by Canadian thespian Mark Camacho) and recount these historically defining events with the grainy, bright-colored look of '70s newsreels to give them a touch of verite.As always, the casting of the characters remains spot-on. Jackman has never been more compelling as Logan than he is here, exhibiting restraint and temerity that brings newfound gravitas and pathos to his character. McAvoy and Fassbender continue to make a fascinating pair, portraying their emotionally complex relationship with heartfelt poignancy especially when contrasted against their kinder, gentler older selves who wonder why they spent so many years bickering. Lawrence however doesn't quite make an impact as one may have hoped, but the actress remains a fetching presence whether in human form or in Mystique's blue birthday suit.That's still a minor, very minor, quibble for a movie which gets so many things right. The action is first engaging, then thrilling, and finally at its climax exhilarating. The characters are well sketched out, their dilemmas real, relatable and therefore genuinely affecting. The story is complex without ever being complicated. For a summer blockbuster, it belongs in a rare breed that blends emotional resonance, humour, wit and grand spectacle into one immensely satisfying whole. Like we said, it is in a word, extraordinary.","

"FisheyFilms","22 May 2014","*Spoilers*I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. To start with the good points.The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.Now for the not so good points.Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once. Singer, please pass the torch on to someone else and get the fresh feeling back that was First Class.","

"macblackslair","21 May 2014","In the near future, mutants and ordinary humans alike are under attack and losing the battle. So our heroes from former installments try to prevent this war by sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the past so he can fix the mess a certain blue lady (Jennifer Lawrence) is creating. In the year 1973, Wolverine meets young and depressed Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) again. Will he succeed in uniting the two mutant geniuses and change everything?That said, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a thrilling experience. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is amazing, as are their performances. Again. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as Hank. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, meaning he IS THE Wolverine. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage does a great job as Dr. Trask. And yes, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven. Plus, we see Ellen Page and Omar Sy, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great as ever. I like the performances and the acting in general. There are quite some emotional scenes. Needless to say that James McAvoy pulls them off so well it almost hurts.""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" promises fun as well. Action sequences are spiced with nice effects and flavored with some humor. Evan Peters who plays Quicksilver is amazing in his role and gives you something to watch in amazing 3D.Last but not least, the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, I have seen even better results, but scenes, cuts, and effects fit the movie. 3D looks and feels great.Overall, I rate it as one of the best X-Men movies so far. Although I am aware of some logical gaps (considering the original X-Men movie time line), I accept ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" as a more or less alternate canon time line. By doing so, it is easy to enjoy these two hours full of mutants, their powers, and their fears.","

"Screen_Blitz","26 May 2014","I can't tell you how incredible this was. This would probably the best film of X-men series, why? First, the story was fantastic and never lost my attention. Secondly, the characters were pretty amazing, especially Wolverine. While he always the central character of the franchise, Hugh Jackman portrays him well and his performances never gets old. Jennifer Lawrence also did decent job as Mystique. The rest of the characters were pretty good as well.The fight action scenes were definitely the best parts of the movie, mostly because of its eye popping special(and visual) effects. The opening scene with the mutants fighting against the sentinel robots and the final battle towards the end were my favorite scenes of the movie.This is best movie I've seen this year so far. I'm excited for the this series next installment, which is called X-Men Apocalypse and set to be released in May 2016.","

"GusF","28 September 2014","Not only the best film in the series but one of the best films that I've seen all year. The acting, direction (Bryan Singer is the safest pair of hands imaginable for the series), special effects and script were all brilliant. It is the perfect sequel for both the original trilogy and ""First Class"". I love time travel films - four of my Top 10 films fall into that category - and this is one of the cleverest in many a year. To that end, I loved the intertwining of the past and future towards the end of the film and the wonderful contrasts between Magneto's actions in the two timeframes. The ending of the film was fantastic and I adored the cameos in its final minutes. The post-credits scene certainly whetted my appetite for the next film! It's a shame that I'll have to wait two years for it. This is now second only to ""Superman"" as my favourite superhero film. It's everything that I ever wanted from an ""X-Men"" film and more.","

"PCC0921","22 April 2022","It was only a matter of time before we would see the FOX X-Men universe combine their two eras together. The original series debuted in X-Men (2000), complete with two sequels. The new series began with X-Men: First Class (2011), which precedes this film. There also was a solo Wolverine film, that came out in 2009, so it was time to combine the great points of both eras. Also, you can expect some great Hugh Jackman/Logan moments coming in this film. But, Wolverine isn't all of it. Pretty much, everyone, from both eras, are in this film. For anyone who hasn't seen any of the FOX X-Men film franchise, this is the one to see, because it gives you a dose of both worlds. It gives you the best idea of what the franchise was like. It is not the best X-Men film. I reserve that label for the first two films (2000 & 2003), but this one is pretty good. Speaking of which, director Bryan Singer, who directed the first two films, took a break from the X-Universe, but eventually returned for this film.Another interesting aspect of this film is the idea of time traveling, of sorts. It's actually a brilliant way to merge these two eras together. It's a simple explanation too. Wolverine's conscious is transported back to his current body found in 1973, to find and stop Mystique/Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), from making a huge mistake. Raven, who through the wrong intentions, is the catalyst to the creation of the mutant-killing androids, known as the Sentinels. These killer robots, built off of mutant DNA, in Logan's original time period, are on the verge of wiping out the planet Earth. So, it's back-to-the-future style, only with mind-transfers. It is Logan's connection to both time periods, that allows us to see what is happening in both places. It's Raven's actions, that set the course of the film. It's a great way to utilize these creatively complex Marvel characters.Michael Fassbender finally settles in well with his antagonist, Magneto character. The leader of the evil mutants, bent on making mutant-kind king. The opposite view of the heroic mutant X-Men. The X-Men have always stood for coexistence with human-kind. It is the Sentinels, that makes them set aside their differences and all if them have to band together to stop this horrible threat. In the future (or a possible present), we see Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), a duo of classically trained actors, use the wisdom and strength of the roles they have been doing for almost 15 years. The rest of the cast comprises of some of the younger students from Xavier's class, like Kitty Pride (Elliot Page) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). In the past time period, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy, the Beast (Nicholas Hoult), are the ones, who first meet the mind-time-transfer of Logan in 1973. It is a complex meeting. A meeting that proves things might be difficult for Logan's mission. It is this point, that takes the film onto the direction it needs to go, as we venture into this new time period of 1973.There also is a cameo from a stand-out character, that debuts with a huge flash and ends up being a break-out character and fan favorite. In order to find Raven's location, Logan, Hank and Charles, enlist the aid of a young man, Peter (Evan Peters), who is a speedster, to break Magneto out of his specialized, metal-free prison. The year before Pietro/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), debuted in the MCU (not counting his brief cameo in the end-credits of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), a month before this film was released), this is when the world meets for the first time, the Marvel character, Peter/Quicksilver. Trust me, there are plenty of more characters, who return to this film from all over the franchise, plus plenty of surprises too. Bryan Singer directs another good one. Ignore how things have changed for the X-Men film franchises since 2014. The future of these characters will be fine in the MCU's hands moving forward, but the FOX X-Men franchise ended, overall, a huge success and has become part of film history. Try and watch this film in a 2014 frame of mind. It's probably best not to compare the X-Men films with the MCU, because they are proving to be completely different from each other, but still based off the same intellectual property.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.","

"comsatteur","24 May 2014","Putting aside my being a die-hard Marvel fan and summoning my critical perception to the film, I say this with most sincerity, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film of X-Men franchise yet, and for that matter one of cinematic history's best of the superhero genre, easily lining itself to other superhero films' gems like The Dark Knight and the Avengers. I would like to begin by saying that Bryan Singer is a miracle worker (making the ""impossible"" filmable), making X-Men DOFP one of his finest. Singer carefully crafted every single scene with such awe and sincerity that the word perfection isn't enough to describe it. May it be a series of CGI effects, unique action extravaganzas, and powerful, moving emotional scenes, Singer never failed to blend the elements of a superhero film with human drama. His powerful direction certainly brought the best in each of the cast and unlocked their hidden potentials. For the storyline, I would like to commend the writers for their excellent writing that never failed to amuse and captivate the audience with powerful storytelling while maintaining logic and perceiving bigger messages to society and human faults. (BTW I'm not a huge comic book reader so I don't have any idea what X-Men DOFP would be about) Anyways, the writers did an excellent job in connecting the dots from the past X- Men films (though it's not necessary to watch them all to fully understand the film). Now for the stellar cast: I think the whole cast (both new and recurring) did their best to fully portray the characters they're embodying. First, kudos both to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who both are the embodiment of X-Men themselves; even though their pretty much in the same place the whole film, their performance proved to be timeless without severing emotional vulnerability and the bond of a strong true friendship. Hugh Jackman's performance in the film could be argued as his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. What can we say? He's Hugh Jackman. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's characters have evolved so much from the first film, and the two of them displayed performance that made X-Men DOFP superior to other X-Men films. Their portrayals held such pain and confusion from their damaged relationship that made them human despite their superhuman distinctions. Of course there's the ever-astonishing Jennifer Lawrence whose acting prowess is unmatched. Lawrence's Mystique is one of the best portrayal of a troubled character in a superhero film, exploiting mixed feelings with pure acting that made Mystique and Jennifer Lawrence a very crucial piece to the film's success. And for the newcomer Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, portrayed a villain with no actual superpowers but made the future as it was in the beginning of the film. His role as Bolivar Trask is an interesting character fighting for survival with judgment clouded by society's erroneous perception. The actors in the supporting roles also did very well. Ellen Page got the spotlight she deserved with her vulnerable yet enduring portrayal of Kitty Pride, who's the bread-and-butter character of the film. Shawn Ashmore has grown so much since his first X-Men film, and that maturity is very much shown in his strong portrayal of Iceman. Halle Berry, while she has a much smaller role in the film, steals the spotlight every second she appeared on screen. The appearance of Bill Stryker (Josh Helman) is of course appreciated as it gives us a brief window to Wolverine's character and proves the quantum theory about time which is an important aspect to the storyline. Smaller roles which are included for filling the shoes of other characters showed so much potential that it's too disappointing they didn't got a chance to develop throughout the film: Colossus (who's supposed to be Kitty Pride's couple, though I don't think that's necessary for now), Sunspot, Bishop, Warpath, Blink (instantly my new favorite character) and Havok from the past. By the way, special mention to Evan Peters and his portrayal of Quicksilver for being too awesome. I think it's very obvious that he would appear not only in future X-Men films but also in other Marvel films (such as Avengers 2) because he's such an iconic character. As expected, the cameo appearances by James Marsden and Famke Janssen as Cyclops and Phoenix set us for the next X-Men film, which I think is great. So that's pretty much my though for X-Men: Days of Future Past (not including the visual effects, sound, costume design etc.). This is a must-see film and it is sure to entrance die-hard Marvel fans and non-fan viewers alike.","

"mattkratz","13 August 2014","This was an outstanding entry in the X-Men/Marvel Comics series of movies. The only disappointment:no cameo by Stan Lee! The movie centers around an assassination on a scientist 50 years earlier by Mystique/Raven, which will lead to an attack and subsequent war with android-like characters called the Sentinels. The war is very devastating. The solution-send one of them back in time to prevent the assassination, and that someone turns out to be Wolverine. (Doesn't this remind you a bit of the Terminator?) He tracks down the younger versions of the Mutants and makes an attempt to thwart the assassination.This movie features superb action, characters, special effects, and surprises.

Bringing together the nostalgia of the original trilogy and the precision of the new generation, X-Men: Days of Future Past is brilliant.This film truly showcases the power of each individual mutant. Every character has a moment that displays the depth of their power. The relationships are meaningful and the future of the X-Men franchise is left wide-open. With a delicate script and excellent performances across the board, this film is the best ensemble X-Men film to date.Additional Note: The Quicksilver slo-mo scene is an all-time great!","

"mike-3905","26 May 2014","Up front, I should say I'm not a fan of the Marvel (etc.) genre. I wanted to see a movie with my daughter (15) and we both thought we could truck with this, having both enjoyed X-Men: First Class.An otherwise talented cast ham their way through a wooden script, delivering a few moments of charm but nothing approximating genuine human pathos, and a whole lot of eye-rolling awfulness.Despite the movie's premise having been lifted from elsewhere, the movie plays out exactly as you would expect. This film treats its audience like children, and could have been written by a committee of younger fans. Perhaps I should have expected that.For me, special effects are not enough: I've seen those before. They must serve a dramatic purpose, but here, the money shots only served to cheapen my overall experience. Mutants are not enough. I know enough about the characters already. It's like ""okay, I get it - finish the story!"" It lacks anything for grown-ups, having a dramatic arc comparable to Saturday afternoon TV offerings like Dukes of Hazzard or The A Team (showing my age there). Sorry to be blunt, but if this is the best the genre can offer, I will steer clear in future.","

"abisio","27 May 2014","X-MEN has been called the ""thinking people comic"" and there is a lot of truth on that. It is as dark as Batman and full of fantasy as Superman but not shallow as both. X-MEN concept is a profound and not easy to work; racism and power struggle. It is quite interesting but requires lots of character and situation development, drama and action in equal parts. My belief is that the franchise never got the popularity of Batman or Iron Man was because of Mr. Bryan Singer lousy direction. The universe of the mutants is a crowd of characters but Mr. Singer is unable to work with more than two or three in the first line or developing complex dramatic situations without sorting out with FX.Days of Future Past is another example of his lack of control.As in his two previous movies; many mutants beloved characters are just shown for a couple of seconds doing almost nothing; Storm, Shadowcat, Iceman barely have a couple of lines; but this times even Stewart and McKellen has almost nothing to do (McKellen looks bored and uncomfortable in his very few scenes). Quicksilver gets a few minutes of screen time, does his thing and is send away for the rest of the movie. During his scenes the other characters has little to do.The script is good enough to cover most of Mr. Singer errors; but some things just do not make any sense:*****SPOILER ALERT ***** After losing Vietnam; do not believe Mr. Nixon will avoid a conflict with mutants, specially if one mutant is able to move a baseball stadium to surround the White House. Such power showdown should immediately provoke the mutants persecution. Dinklage character (Dr. Trask is not clearly defined); he is a different kind of mutant but is also an ambitious and greedy person. Why try to put him as an idealist ?.Young Magneto is pretty much a psycho during the movie. Most of his actions do not make any sense; while the old one gives his life to save the others.Raven / Mystique internal conflict is lame and could have been easily solved in much less screen time. She is a killer so why try to make her a nice person ?. Perhaps the projected spin off ?*****END OF SPOILERS ******There are many more errors; like the negation of X-MEN Last Stand; the one directed by Brett Ratner when Singer decided to make the boring Superman Reboot in 2006.Chris Columbus directed the first two Harry Potter's movies; but then realized he was not ready to handle the tone of the book so he pass the baton to Cuaron and then to other directors. Mr. Singer learn from him if you love the franchise.","

"alindsayal","12 December 2021","Next in my line of X-Men films to watch is the film that bought the two timelines together, X-Men: Days Of Future Past and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a future where Mutants are hunted down and destroyed by machines called Sentinels, Professor Xavier & Magneto send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must find there younger selves and stop Mystique from killing the creator of the machines.Main Character
There are a few main characters here so I am going to put them together. First of all is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and he is fantastic here, he is still the charming and charismatic guy here but it is also nice to see a more veteran version of the character that has to be a mentor to a young Xavier. In some of the previous films he has been given screen time over other characters but he is here the appropriate amount and it doesn't overshadow some other amazing performances. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are back as young Xavier and Magneto and they are amazing here. First of all McAvoy is fascinating, they really humanise Xavier here and they do a really good job of making him interesting and compelling, he feels even more human here then he did in First Class and it is a real highlight here. Then onto Fassbender who totally revels in his role as more of an antagonist but once again he is a remarkable antagonist, there is one scene on a plane that shows the strength of his performances and character. Also their chemistry together is still brilliant and really shows that Fox nailed it with this casting.Supporting Characters
I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a good job as Mystique in First Class but she steps it up a level here. She ups it in the action scenes and really feels closer to the Mystique that we saw in the original films, she also has a really interesting character arc and it feels like her emotions are stuck between Xavier and Magneto and it puts her in a really interesting position. Sir Ian Mckellen and Sir Patrick Stewart play the older versions of Magneto and Xavier and once again do a great job, they get less screen time here as the film mainly focus on the younger cast but they still add plenty to their roles and deliver when needed. Peter Dinklage, Nicolas Hoult and Ellen Page also give good performances in there smaller roles, also Evan Peters as Quicksilver is a show stealer, he isn't in the film much but when he is he owns every scene that he is in.Story
The story is really good, the characters are at the forefront of the story. We spend the majority of time with Wolverine and the younger cast and the position that the film puts them, I mean Xavier, Magneto and Mystique are really well handled and it makes them interesting characters. The contrast with the future scenes are great to, it is a dark really grim world which makes you realise why this drastic action is taken by the mutants. The last act is also fabulous and does a great job in showing how much the characters develop throughout the film.Script
The script is really great here, there are some fantastic dramatic moments and dialogue here. Plus the questioning of ideology is here in a great way, looking at the ideology of Xavier, Magneto and Mystique is great and that all of them are different. In this film they aren't really heroes or villains throughout but work towards their roles in the moral spectrum which is well handled. Also when needed the humour is good and it adds tot he quality of the film.Style
The style of the film is great, the 1970's looks great and the future scenes look really good and it fits the time periods that they are in and what has happened. The action scenes are really great, the powers are pushed to higher levels and the design choices are really unique and truly great and yes Beast looks so much better in this film.Overall
Overall, this is a brilliant comic book movie. It has great acting, great action scenes and a great narrative and is a must watch for anybody with an interest in The X-Men.Rating - 10/10.","

"parmetd","29 May 2014","First of all, this movie violates all that makes science fiction great. It seeks to explain every last detail of the science fiction (how sentinels work, how time travel works, why its necessary etc). The beauty in Asimov and the original TV & written versions of this specific story is that the details were not revealed because it was not necessary to do so!The poorly written and even worse acting of the story aside.... Bryan Singer should be ashamed of himself for so fundamentally altering the story. Trask was not the original target but Dr. X himself. X was not alive in the future. Mystique is also growing up in Germany as the darkest most vile villain not a childhood playmate of X. The story smacks of disgusting from start to finish. Minus one or two cool fight scenes in the future, this movie should be forgotten and destroyed.","

"alwaysplanb","26 May 2014","Being an X-Men fan, I was expecting superb action in the movie. Whereas the storyline is decent, the movie seriously lacks noteworthy action. This is an ongoing trend that movie goers in US are giving more weightage to story than action. And that's what probably drives the directors to focus more on script.However, last thing we expect from an X-Men movie is inferior action. Even a single comics of X-Men, a single episode of X-men animation, has more action than this movie. Lack of action means all the fun has been dragged away this time. The only fight I really enjoyed was the slo-mo action sequence with QuickSilver. Now that was IMPRESSIVE!Coming to plot. Q1. Wasn't Quicksilver the son of Magneto? Then what's with the new story? Q2. Why can't Kitty send Wolverine back in time to kill Trask before he creates Sentinel program? Or stop him from even being born?Q3. What's with Magneto's mood. First he tries to kill Mystique. Failing which he tries to kill Nixon! Wouldn't killing Nixon only ascertain the inevitable?Q4. The ending was most questionable. If the past is changed, wouldn't the future be changed in a PARALLEL universe instead of the one from which Wolverine's sent? OR, if there is NO PARALLEL universe, the future should have changed the moment Wolverine's consciousness was sent back. Instead, the future remains unchanged for the same time for which the past is unchanged. So, basically you are applying the concept (timeline) of Parallel Universe WITHOUT ANY PARALLEL universe. Wow!I know that Mindless action is appreciated by none. But please don't forget that it's a superhero movie for god's sake. See Avengers for example. Decent story, lots of comic moments and great action. Yet even with Sentinels in this movie, action is far from explosive.If story is what you want from an X-Men movie, by all means do enjoy this one. But if you want decent action, you are better off watching X2 for the nth time than Days of Future Past.","

"sesht","22 May 2014","Thought I'm sorely tempted to credit Nolan for the thinking person's blockbuster, I cannot deny that Singer has been there before, and done that before (for some, he's done better before, in the mainstream realm). Fear not, he betters the best mainstream X-Men movie he's done with this one. I, for one, love 'First Class', and what Vaughn brought to it. When they announced that has-been Singer was returning to helm, I was worried. Well, was I wrong. Sure, it might have perhaps been better with Vaughn in the director's chair (who knows?), but this is one intelligent piece of mainstream cinema that I, for one, will wanna watch once again (the darkness that pervades converted 3D cinema is very much in your face for this outing, and I'd like another viewing, not just for that reason).Perhaps one of the best outings for Jackman's mutant ever, this one sets up the next one in this universe very cleverly, and yes, far too conveniently as well, but I'm not gonna be the one to complain. Bringing some cool first-time visual aesthetics to the starved sci-fi actioner genre, this one plays like the trend-setting first Matrix movie for the never-too-creatively-bereft superhero cinema, which did need a shot in the arm post the latest Spidey outing, that was shorn of the intellectual edgeWith nods to various characters, old and new, and various Easter eggs sprinkled, laying the foundation for upcoming alternate universe tales, this is sheer joy, with my only concern being the way movie studio franchises will now ape the rebooting of each franchise with the same set of characters and actors, and are liable to have eggs on their face more often than not, since this is lightning in a bottle.The 3D (converted) is pretty good, but it will depend on the projection system in the cinema you choose. All in all, a pretty good time at the movies after 'The winter soldier'. Enjoy!","

"Dm86","21 September 2014","I've waited a long time for this one. X-Men: First Class was truly first class in my opinion, from the perspective of a comic-book-turned-movie. I thought there is no way for Days of Future Past to disappoint me, but sadly, I was wrong.Don't get me wrong or think I am to negative - the movie is visually great (especially the ""villains"") and the actors do their job more than well. The story is also very interesting and gripping. However, when I watch a Marvel movie, I expect action, thrills and adventure. I do like drama - but not here and definitely not that much. A bit of drama would be OK, but the levels of melodrama we get from certain characters (I don't want to spoil anything so I'll skip the name, but you'll know it when you see it) are simply not fitting for this kind of movie.After some great starting sequences, my wife and I started wondering why is the movie losing pace and when will the ""real X-Men movie"" start. We rolled our eyes more than once during some scenes, although we are both huge franchise fans.I give it a six because I like X-Men and it's visually great and the story is okay. But that is as high as it gets for me. Despite that, I would recommend watching it because I see some very good reviews here so I hope not all of you find it as disappointing as I did.","

"leplatypus","27 July 2014","I can't understand why comics and movies can't be one and the same nowadays.Here, the divorce starts with the movie poster: for those who have Byrne's cover in mind, the awful art and meaningless composition used for promoting this adaptation is a disappointment: if you can understand what the movie is about, you are then a genius.Logically, the movie is in the same vein as its poster: instead to adapt Claremont's gripping drama (by the way, he has a cameo as a member of the panel!) and put Byrne's drawings in live action, the movie decides to do its own (bad) way by telling a new complicated story and using awful new design (a bit like the disastrous remake of « the earth stood still »). To resume, all the future time-line is crap: sentinels are ugly, Shadowcat is telepathic and worst of all, the X-men are well alive: all the power of the original story was built on the fact that Rachel Summers and Kitty were the only one living so that their mission just couldn't fail. By the way, by changing all those essential parameters, the movie also erases the big paradox of the comics: As the daughter of Scott and Jean, how could the past in which Rachel is sent was one in which she isn't born yet and her mother has been already killed: If you remember Doc Brown's lessons, you know that it can't happen.The present time-line is much better but it's the direct follow-up of the previous movie. So if you don't have seen it (like me), you will be a bit lost as it's a really unexpected team roaster for X-men (Wolvie, Magneto, Xavier, Beast and Mystique). In addition, the finale wasn't really exciting as it was very similar to the finales of all previous movies. In fact, the movie is only good in its first part, from the arrival of Wolvie to the summit in Paris. The 70s were coolly done and Quicksilver was the only one mutant really used to his potential.As I have already written about «Thor », Hollywood really doesn't understand comics: They are poor writers who think that big special effects are visual achievement !","

"classicsoncall","25 May 2014","By now, it doesn't surprise me any more when a film like this breaks into IMDb's Top 100 films (#65 as I write this) after only a couple days of release. No point in dwelling on that, but I mention it for some perspective; here's a comic book movie in the same elite company as ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Casablanca"". Go figure.So with a time travel theme as the main plot element here, it would seem like some aspects of the story would be confusing but I followed it along pretty well. But help me out here. When Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) did the Jedi mind trick to gain access to the White House speech, was that a rip-off? Or since it was 1973, would you say that this was four years before ""Star Wars"" came out and a totally original idea? See, these time travel stories can be confusing after all.Now it might seem like I'm ripping the movie unfairly here, but that's not my intent. I actually had a blast with the picture, even if I'm not specifically a Marvel Comics fan. I've seen all the other X-Men titles, though not chronologically, and I think this one stacks up with ""X-Men:First Class"" at the top of the heap. It had decent character development and excellent effects, and the 'Time in a Bottle' sequence with Quicksilver (Evan Peters) was probably the stand out scene, offering a nod to yet another sci-fi thriller in ""The Matrix"". It's too bad you can't do a re-wind when you're in the theater, I would have played that one a few more times.Where this all goes from here is anybody's guess. I think the X-Men franchise is ripe for further picking, and this time they made you wait until the very end of the credits roll to give a hint of what's to come. I really didn't recognize the female character in the Darth Maul get-up, but my very fuzzy memory of the comics calls to mind a story line dealing with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. On the flip side, I could be totally off base on this altogether.In a separate but related note, one of the trailers screened before this movie in my theater looked like a real hoot and a half coming out in August. It looked like Marvel's take on the Star Wars universe (there it is again), with a rousing score for Guardians of the Galaxy. Looks like fun.","

"bbickley13-921-58664","23 May 2014","Bryan Singer is back at the helm and he nails it with Days of Future Past, hands down this is going to be one of the best movies of the summer.I was a little scared how the story was going to pan out because of the poster that shows Jenifer Lawrence just as huge as Hugh Jackman, fearing that the story would reflect her status as an Oscar winning star, but unlike most of the other X-Men movies this movie is not even the Wolverine show. Every major character got more of a chance to shine in this flick.And of course the best part of the film is the mutants. We got to see some old ones like Shadowcat, played by Ellen Page, who uses her powers differently in this film, and new ones like Quicksilver who proves super fast heroes are awesome. It was great to see them use their powers, but will admit Singer still has a long way to go with special effects.Peter Dinklage brings the drama to the cast. His outing as Bolivar Trask the major bad guy was perfect, and it's good to see him do stuff outside of Game of Thrones. The movie does not fully pay attention to the continuity of all the films, but what's good about time travel is that it sets everything in place. Now we are fully completing with the Marvel cinematic universe over at Disney. Can't wait to see X-Men: Apocalypse now. You got to see this one.","

"jaysanchu07","31 December 2021","It was immensely satisfying to finally witness an X-Men film that got the fights scenes right. Both scenes that pit the X-Men stand outs against the cartoon-famous Sentinels were highly entertaining, CGI done right. There was a sense of melancholy as well, as we see sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart kick ass in what could be their final reprisal of their iconic roles. Story (and the usual mutant-human melodrama) has its moments. The only downsides in my opinion, JLaw's forgettable acting and James Mcavoy's constant pained expression. Both are rather overplayed and exhausting.","

"ArchonCinemaReviews","20 August 2014","Marvel brings the seventh X-Men installment and second prequel in the series with X-Men Days of Future Past.It is a very fitting title, reuniting with director Bryan Singer who did the first ever X-Men film, and with Singer brings a connected and comprehensible plot consistent with the rest of the X-Men franchise.It is nearing the hopeless end of the mutant war in present time and humanity is frantic, at a critical and pivotal point, at the start of X-Men Days of Future Past. The remaining X-Men send Wolverine back in time to right the wrong of the past that set the course for this destructive terminus.What follows is a suspenseful, powerful and action-packed flick that is sure to please fans. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always been the anchor to the film franchise and it is befitting that he is the hopeful savior in Days of Future Past and a welcoming addition. All other actors, most of them playing roles portrayed by other actors, inhabit their roles successfully. Jennifer Lawrence is the most awkward of all, especially depicting Mystique's cold malice but brought out the humanity of Raven nicely.The story that follows is flawless and perfectly incorporated into the X-Men's universe, fitting seamlessly into currently known history of its characters as already presented in film. To that I owe Jane Goldman, the story writer, and Simon Kinberg, the screenplay writer, distinction. At first I was a bit confused whether I was to be concerned and emotionally invested but within fifteen minutes everything became clear. The story is surprisingly uncomplicated despite having time-travel as a core subject and has a well formed grasp on its direction.With any X-Men film there are bound to be action sequences and they are particularly spellbinding in X-Men Days of Future Past. They harnessed the mutant characters' abilities to accentuate the battles instead of exploiting them for the typical detracting 'wow' factor effect. I found them especially believable and well choreographed.Audiences love X-Men films because at their core they are about unjust persecution for being different. We all like to think we are unique and looming is the sense that eventually it could be us on the wrong side of discrimination. The sentiment of X-Men Days of Future Past reflects this theme most evidently of all the films and should be a hit with audiences.More reviews of recently released films can be found at our website!","

"hopsinglinglao","23 May 2014","I give this film one star because the best part was by FAR the quicksilver character and his shining scene(s), which was well worth the ticket price to see. And the acting in this film as well as CGI is great.But this is an already over-hyped, over ambitious, bunch of nothingness on the screen for 2 hours that is disappointing when you think about it for more than 5 minutes.What is with the need to have Wolverine's Bare A** in a pg-13 movie basically for kids who like comic books? ? And a funny line from the much better predecessor, First Class, dropped the F-Bomb in a very useful and powerful way, but in this film they use their PG13 F word to reference an already old joke...WE GET IT. It's not funny, if you're going to be edgy, make it an R Rated film. Not sure why in a light-hearted super hero film we need this garbage along with a side plot of our main character basically being hooked to smack and shooting needles into his arm like it's a Pulp Fiction junkie.And does every super hero movie since Dark Knight have to be full of gloomy whining ironically detached emo hipster super heroes?And the remainder of this review is all WHYS for Hollywood writers/executives who thought this script made sense:Why the cliché 70's schtick? Just because the 70's has iconic events and fashion/music, doesn't mean that every waking moment was filled with greatest hits of the 70's references, and not every person was dressed like a bad SNL sketch about the 70's, and not every 70's film has to drive into our heads that JFK, NIXON, and the Vietnman War were all things....and furthermore, the bad technocolor ""70's"" film footage of mutants fighting was laughable and brought NOTHING to the film, and never paid off whatsoever. Not to mention most of the technology made no sense in other spots of the film. Why try to keep true to real historical characters in our history like Nixon or JFK when in movies like X2 there is just some generic president of the USA??? Just referencing history's greatest hits that mouthbreathers MAY HAVE HEARD OF, does not automatically make your film epic or legit.Why the rushed distopian future set up and why if the killer terminator robots were made and operational in the 1970's did we not hear anything about them in the previous X Men films? It's as shoehorned as the ""prophecy"" from the Star Wars prequels. The future world did not feel lived in...it was just set piece and set piece and set piece, filled with some characters who seem more interesting than the boring idiots we were following.Why cram so many characters into the film when you can't fit ALL of them anyways? Cyclops for 2 seconds may as well be no cyclops. Where was Magic Mike as Gambit? May as well.What is the need to have teen wolf in this movie? I mean, beast. But seriously, the makeup makes him look like Teen Wolf and his powers in this over optimistic scenario did not really stack up well. Should have brought back night crawler or...anyone else.WHY Stryker AGAIN? Why Magneto AGAIN? Are these the only villains we can get in EVERY F**king X men film from now on? Every X Men movie now has had the same major villain and Wolverine Origins had stupid young Stryker already, it is getting old. And on a side note, Magneto as a character has conflicting personality traits/motivations that make NO sense. The writers need to decide on what type of mind he has, or reveal he has multiple personalities, which he apparently does.And why does Magneto need an entire baseball stadium to trap a few whitehouse employees? Does he not know that baseball stadiums usually have EXITS? Did he not realize the whitehouse could have had an underground tunnel exit? Did he not realize the president could have been in something NOT made entirely of metal? Did magneto not think the many robots would not suffice? Oh CGI has to look stunning so big set piece shoehorned. And come to think of it, they didn't need magneto at all, they freed this obviously evil idiot just to have him become the villain...AGAIN. WHY the hell have so few scenes with Quicksilver? He was by far the most charismatic and interesting. Would have paid off if he saved the day instead of Professor King Of Ireland Speech. Which at this point is as surprising as an Optimus Prime pep talk. And seriously so many people in this film had NOTHING to do. What was the point of making none of the previous films count? Oh NONE OF THAT HAPPENED! Really? Well, if it were X3 or Origins that is good for the studios and our money that is down the toilet.Time travel is fun but this film's logic is lame.So sick of getting less for more and being told it is substance, it is the SAME NONSENSE but even more watered down.I did like those robots too..so hooray for the mutant killers who I wish were the stars of this idiotic mindless film.","

"gavinp9","2 January 2018","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the fifth X-Men film (let's not include the Wolverine movies in this count) and does a good job of linking the original trilogy (2000-2006) to the 2011 prequel, 'X-Men: First Class'. The story starts off in the not-too-distant future (i.e. a decade or so after 'X-Men: The Last Stand'), where the Sentinels have almost hunted mutant-kind - and some of human-kind - to extinction. The plus side of this is that we get to see grown-up Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), Shadow Cat (Page), Storm (Berry), Iceman (Ashmore) & Colossus (Cudmore) - plus new additions Sunspot (Canto), Bishop (Sy), Warpath (Stewart) & Blink (Fan - who? Yeah, even I don't know who Blink is - some sort of weird mix between Nightcrawler & Psylocke) - and how they're living in the Terminator 4-esque future. The solution? Send Wolverine into the past to try to stop the Sentinels from being created. (I'm not sure how Shadow Cat's phasing ability inexplicably lets her transport people to the past...)This is where - in 1973 - we're re-introduced to young Charles (McAvoy) & Eric (Fassbender). There's some good moments as they meet Wolverine for the ""first"" time, including drafting in Quicksilver (Peters). I'm glad they hinted that Magneto is his father, but it's a shame the same actor won't be playing him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. We also meet Dr Trask (Dinklage, solid as ever), the creator of the Sentinel program and find out how Mystique (Lawrence) is out to assassinate him. I'm not sure why the films have so much focus on her, when she's not really that interesting a character in the comics and certainly not as pivotal as the films make her. Beast (Hoult) is good and I'm glad they got one of the original five X-Men in there with Xavier (no sighting of Angel at all!). It all gets slightly confusing, as the ""future"" X-Men fight off Sentinels to stop Wolverine from coming back to the future (had to be said!), while the ""past"" X-Men fight Magneto, Mystique & Sentinels separately!There's some pretty massive set pieces at the end, with all the sets/costumes of the 70s looking great/realistic too (including Nixon!), but it all seemed just a little lacklustre to me. A few things don't quite add up and I had higher expectations from the future battles, as well as from the young Professor X/Magneto dynamic. It felt to me like it was building to something massive and the pay-off wasn't quite there. Sure, it's an enjoyable ending (I'm still looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and does a good enough job of linking the films/characters, but I think Fox bit off more than they could chew. It was a little slow in parts and Wolverine certainly seemed like a passenger with not much to do. There were certainly some fun scenes and some exciting scenes, but not enough to elevate this to 'Avengers' status.","

"Paragon240","2 January 2023","Days of Future Past was the pinnacle of the 20th Century Fox X-Men franchise. It beautifully unites the original cast with the First Class cast in one of the best X-Men comic book stories. The story feels urgent and high stakes right from the beginning, with the world destroyed and only a small band of mutants fighting to survive and try to prevent this apocalyptic future. The time travel plot of the film allows Hugh Jackman to interact with McAvoy and the young X-Men but also bring back the older cast and correct some of the franchise's past mistakes. Evan Peters' Quicksilver offers some of the movie's best moments with his silly but technically stunning scenes. Seeing Stewart and McKellen back and seeing their performances contrasted with McAvoy and Fassbender was incredible. With great highs like X2 and First Class and disappointing lows like Last Stand and Dark Phoenix, Days of Future Past rises as the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic book films of all time.","

"Hellmant","23 May 2014","'X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST': Five Stars (Out of Five)The seventh 'X-MEN' movie is once again directed by Bryan Singer (returning to the franchise for the first time since 2003's 'X-MEN 2') and written by Simon Kinberg (who also co-wrote 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND') with Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Vaughn and Goldman also co-wrote 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS', which Vaughn also directed). It's based on a 2 issue storyline from the Marvel Comics comic book 'The Uncanny X-Men', called 'Days of Future Past' (written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, in 1981), which has the X-Men using Kitty Pride's abilities, to time travel a person's mind back in time, in order to stop a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and killed by Sentinels (giant robots). Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart all reprise their roles from previous movies. Anna Paquin also returns as Rogue but most of her scenes were cut from the final theatrical film. Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Bingbing Fan, Booboo Stewart and Adan Canto all join the cast this time around as well. I found it to be highly entertaining and everything I hoped it would be; easily the best movie in the series since Singer last directed. The story begins in 2023; a dark dystopian future where mutants are being killed off by shape-shifting machines called Sentinels. A small group of X-Men have been able to survive by using Kitty Pryde's (Page) power to transport another mutant's mind, Bishop (Sy), back in time (to warn them about future Sentinel attacks). Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart), now working with Magneto (McKellen), comes up with the idea of time-traveling back to a crucial event, in 1973, in order to prevent the current nightmarish world (they live in) from ever happening. Wolverine (Jackman) is the only one who can survive several decades of time-travel (due to his healing powers), so it becomes his mission to find the young Xavier (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) and get them to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from assassinating a man named Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). Trask designed the Sentinels and became a martyr, in the war on mutants, when he was killed. Mystique was also captured and her DNA was used to give the Sentinels the abilities they now have (to replicate any mutant's powers). Stopping these events should then change the future and it's up to Wolverine, Charles, Magneto and Beast (Hoult) to pull it off. I read 'The Uncanny X-Men' comics when I was a kid (and all of it's spin-offs, like 'X-Force', 'Cable' and 'X-Factor') for multiple years (and read several years of back issues too, including 'Days of Future Past'). So I'm a big fan; next to Spider-Man they're my favorites superheroes. The X-Men stories have always had very cool sci-fi elements, and plenty of action, but they've also had deeper themes about dealing with bigotry and being an outsider (like Spider-Man). This is why I could always really identify with the characters and the stories. I love Singer's first two movie adaptations ('X-MEN 2' is one of my all-time favorite films) because they do such a great job of bringing the characters, and those issues, to the big screen. This movie is equally as impressive; it has all the spectacle and action (that all of the films in the franchise are known for) but it also does a really good job of capturing those human elements (and emotions). It's probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series and it's great to see almost all of the cast back for it. I especially enjoy watching Jennifer Lawrence, in the role of Mystique, because she makes a great badass action heroine and it's cool to see her playing a kick-ass villain this time as well. Jackman, Fassbender, McAvoy and all the rest are of course good once again too but it's Singer (back at the helm) that truly gives the movie it's masterpiece status.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs","

"preppy-3","27 May 2014","This takes place in the future. All mutants have been enslaved along with humans who tried to help them. Only a small team of the X-Men remain. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) have an idea to send Wolverine (High Jackman) back into the 1970s to stop a killing from happening and change the future. They send him back but can he change things in time? Next to ""The Final Stand"" this is easily the best X-Men movie ever. I wasn't going to see it because I hated ""X-Men: First Class"" but (technically) this isn't a sequel to that. It ties into that movie but also works with the first three movies. There are plenty of action sequences that are exciting with flawless special effects. It's sometimes however a little TOO violent--one character gets beheaded and another is torn apart. That's going a little too far. Also we're introduced early to a bunch of the X-Men who I didn't recognize...and their names (or powers) are never explained. This was a problem in a few of the earlier movies too. And James McAvoy was back as a young Professor X...and is terrible. All that aside however I loved this. The acting was good and there are many cameos from previous X-Men (it was great seeing Storm and Colossus again). Stewart, McKellan and Jackman easily hold the film together with their wonderful acting and Michael Fassbender is clearly enjoying himself as Megento. So a great film--well worth seeing.","

"almanjit25","24 May 2014","To begin, i loved X-Men: First Class and had high hopes for this one. I'll get it out there, i did not like Days of Future Past. I expected it to be mind-blowing, gritty and emotionally provocative after watching the trailers and reading about it on the web. I expected a collision of worlds, darkness and epic beauty. Instead i got a mediocre film. A great premise ruined by a lazy script and underdeveloped characters. In addition there was a lack of thrills, excitement and twists. The story felt pedestrian, a-been-there-and-seen-that situation if you will. And it was tied together way too neatly, too perfectly. The script doesn't get the most out of its characters and makes them feel bland. I mean the villain has poor motivations and is absolutely unnecessary. Peter Dinklage, who i think is awesome, is wasted in this movie. The Wolverine, who normally i love, is a place setting in this film. He is there but he doesn't do much though is seen throughout. It felt repetitive, too similar in content to everything we've come to expect from the X-Men. Nothing New. I was bored through a huge chunk of it.As i said, the script gets too lazy trying to tie everything together in a perfect package and way too quickly with missed opportunities all through. At times it feels too sappy and cliché and at others where powerful dramatic moments are necessary they are not provided or feel rushed. Here was an opportunity to show a divided nation, propaganda, poisoning of minds from those who hate the mutants and a descending darkness, war and a world at a boiling point in addition to an emotional story, cataclysmic and yet filled with the hope, equality and good i.e everything the X-Men stand for. It was a missed opportunity. I was let down but the film still had its moments. The post credits scene was intriguing and despite this film not reaching my expectations, i cannot wait for X-Men Apocalypse.","

"ericrnolan","16 June 2014","And, no, that is not a lame attempt at a ""Quicksilver"" pun. Honestly.I really, really liked it. It isn't my favorite ""X-Men"" movie — those will always be what is arguably the darkest of the franchise (""X2: X-Men United"") and the lightest (""X-Men: First Class""). But it's definitely a nice addition to the series.Here are a few reactions, with minimal spoilers, in no particular order:-- What a radical shift in tone from ""First Class."" Way to bring the pathos, Bryan Singer. The opening scenes are brutal, and there are many major character deaths. Some of them occur off screen; others do not. Some are violent. I do believe this is the first superhero movie I have ever seen in which a major character and fan favorite has his or her head crushed, in close-up, during the opening action set piece.Speaking of the opening segment, will somebody please validate my uber- nerd-dom and tell me that they saw what I saw?! I KNEW that the overflying airships that are dropping The Sentinels looked familiar. Am I nuts, or are those none other than facsimiles of the lone ""Valhalla"" airship depicted in the woefully under-appreciated ""Marvel 2099″ universe from the mid-1990′s?! If Singer intended that, it's a terrificly obscure and fun shout-out to 40-year-old comic book fans. (Ahem.)There isn't any unnecessary exposition to bore us. This is a major issue in comic book movies. We can forgive the Christopher Nolan films for revisiting Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis, because those films were exceptionally well made. The new Spider-Man films? Not so much. In ""Future Past,"" we have thankfully no flashbacks for every single character. We're briefly told that there is a global pogrom waged by The Sentinels against mutants and innocent humans, and that Xavier and Magneto have joined forces to fight the good fight. Then we're shown various heroes with various superpowers fighting. We don't need to know all of their backstories.The action scenes were very well directed. Nice work, Mr. Singer. The special effects were top notch. What great fun it was seeing Blink, Iceman, Quicksilver and Bishop do their thing.Given the movie's central plot device why on earth are we concerned with Mystique, and not Rogue, given their respective powers? There are a few obvious guesses One, Mystique is a more popular character. Two, Jennifer Lawrence has more star power than Anna Paquin. Still, this bugged me throughout the film.I personally hate the plot device itself, in which various characters can steal or borrow others' powers.Time travel is also a frequently unwieldy plot device, but I think it was capably handled here, thanks to careful writing and a little restraint.It would also be just great if somebody could explain to me how Mystique apparently alters her body mass.I love how this movie and ""First Class"" integrate the comic book mythology with real world events. It's pure fun, especially the nod at JFK.Once again, we have an ""X-Men"" movie in which the darker characters are less predictable and more fun to follow. A better adjusted and more grounded Wolverine makes perfect sense. (We don't need to endlessly revisit the same character arc.) But he actually is less interesting when he becomes more stable. And characters like Beast are flat out boring. I'm happy that we spent a nice amount of time with Magneto, Mystique, and the human antagonists.Speaking of which, Peter Dinklage was perfect as Bolivar Trask. What a performance — especially with respect to making weighty dialogue sound natural — look again at his reaction to the suggestion that he hates mutants. Incredibly good line work. Is this the same guy as in ""Games of Thrones?"" I refuse to watch that show simply because I am tired of hearing about it. But the ""X-Men"" movies seem to do a great job providing us with human adversaries that are threatening despite an absence of super-powers.Michael Fassbender is simply a wonderful actor, and he is perfectly cast as Youngneto. He vocalizes and emotes just like a raging, charismatic ideologue.If I said that Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan were fantastic, that would just be belaboring the obvious.I like Jennifer Lawrence. I do. She was great as a strong, sympathetic protagonist in ""The Hunger Games."" And she deserves her fanbase. But here, she just doesn't demonstrate range enough to play a vengeful, homicidal woman. Rebecca Romjin did a better job of giving us a good, scary, bogeyman to make us think that humans needed protection by Xavier's kids. Or, for an amazing example of a young actress portraying anger and vengeance, look no further than co-star Ellen Page's amazing performance in the brutal, incredible movie, ""Hard Candy"" (2005). Furthermore, Mystique, as written here and in ""First Class,"" just isn't as much fun. No, she wasn't really an identifiable character in the previous movies, but she was a great bad guy — something that a doe- eyed, redeemed Mystique just isn't.Quicksilver steals the show. Evan Peters was awesome. Unsupervised teenagers with superpowers are always fun. This movie takes a lighter look at what transpired in the extremely enjoyable ""Chronicle"" (2012). What would happen if this kid met those kids?It's rather nice seeing how this movie placates fan complaints with ""X- Men 3: The Last Stand.""If you're the kind of flick nut who enjoys movie marathons, good luck figuring out where this film fits chronologically with the other movies! :-Dhttp://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/just-a-few-quick- thoughts-about-x-men-days-of-future-past/","

"phd_travel","27 May 2014","This is a grand long stuffed full of characters movie which will satisfy fans but can try the patience at times.Some scenes in this movie are good like the slowing down of time take down with Peter and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) speaking Vietnamese. This movie has a lot of characters new and old - some only get a few minutes of screen time. Hard to identify the new ones. Peter Dinklage with his distinctive voice is quite a good addition. Fan Bing Bing is more or less silent but pretty. Hugh Nicholas James and Michael are all quite good and convincing.The logic defying time traveling story needs some concentration and pre knowledge of the other movies. I liked X Men First Class for it's historical setting and this one has a some with the Vietnam context. Nixon is quite well done. All the fighting and then it didn't happen feel like a waste of time. In the end I didn't really care which character was trying to stop which one and was quite glad it was over.Overall die hard fans will be happy but for moderate fans it's a bit trying at times. First Class was more palatable, this one has some plus points but it's not as good.","

"ruanstb","10 June 2014","""The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods.""That right there was enough to give me a wet dream! Hyped as the X-Men movie that most fans have been waiting for (especially since X2: X-Men United back in 2003 was such a massive leap forward), as a big fan of the original comic series, it lived up to that hype in a BIG way!What so many other super-hero movies fail to do, is to embrace both intimate melodrama and tongue-in-cheekiness to make a spectacular mix of intensity and fun, balanced with just the right amount of interesting characters. Another challenge that this movie masters well, is finding a character that the viewer will cheer for... it most definitely doesn't fall short. (Except for Sentinals. Sentinals are dicks.) Heck, even Tyrion Lannister, and Katniss Everdeen are in this movie! Generally, the faster I finish my popcorn the more exciting the film is, and I did stuff my face very quickly.'Days Of Future Past' also continues the X-Men tradition of being politically and sociologically conscious and relevant, bearing a number of allegorical references that fit squarely with many issues faced in modern society.(Cue philosophical discussions here). The special effects are mighty, the humor is sharp and in abundance and the dialogue is alive & breathing. Even though the film is sometimes erratic, the paradoxes of time-travel are exhilarating and extremely fun to watch, despite the complexities. All-in-all it's a mind blowing blockbuster that knocks you out!","

"Puroo","15 April 2021","I'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, ""wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!"" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault.X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique.Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame.And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2.Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.","

OK, so here we go...we're enjoying the little reminder of the first two movie intro's (this one's in a similar style. We've had a bit of dramatic action... I don't think it's really a spoiler to now tell you that this is where some ""time travel"" is involved. Aaaand...that's where I shot the director, your honour. How did Singer go from a good film maker, a director of fair detail, to THIS... :o/Specifically, and again, I don't think I'm ""spoiling"" anything here; we here young ""Professor X"" speak a bit. Waitaminute...let me back up a minute or two first, before I get to it...In the future time, where we see Professor X and Wolverine have a conversation about imminent time travel, Patrick Stewart tells Wolverine, ""I was very different back then""... ...What he neglects to mention is that he has had some sort of lobotomy, or brain surgery...which has resulted in him speaking in a VERY near as damn it, full-on broad COCKNEY ACCENT when ""he"" was younger. When the hell was Xavier EVER been a cockney? As if this weren't enough of a travesty (incidently, I immediately had nightmarish Iron Man 3 flashbacks at this point lol), our younger ""Xavier"" uses the following phrases while talking to Wolverine: ""Bloody"" (as in the swear word)...OK, I can let that slide...it'd be easier though, IF he didn't sound like he were talking about jellied eels... - ""P!!! off."" (again, sounding like he might, at any minute, ask you if he can have a CAP of tea). - ""F!!! off!"" (same deal with the accent). - ""Future sh!te."" Hence, my title to this review.The last three phrases are just SO out of character for Charles Xavier it's unreal. Plus, he obviously shouldn't sound anything like a cockney. For the love of all that is holy GIVE THIS FRANCHISE TO A STUDIO WHO CARES ABOUT GETTING IT RIGHT. I'm totally sick of this now... ..Yeah, I know it's a slim chance anybody with the power to change things might see my review, but in case you wondered, *that's* why I put that in capitals. I love the X-Men, but that's not what this is. You're being lied to. A lot was changed for X1 & X2, but I could deal. Every film since then though, has been a smack in the face to the viewing public. Credit to the person who cast Kelsey as beast in X3, though...perfect choice for how BEAST should speak. There are good actors out there, all we need are some decent writers, and directors who care about detail getting the directing gigs again. Patrick Stewart, is pretty much just dialing it in now, in his film performances. As he did in the abomination that was ST Nemesis. ...If you could buy a Malibu beach house off the back of a terrible movie script though, would you say no to the job? ;oD Not many would. Anyway, I waffle. But seriously ladies and gents. I advise against paying to see this ""movie"" if you care anything for film. Even ""movies"" shouldn't get character details THIS incorrect. And let's bare in mind, this is meant to be kiddie friendly, and the more you feed the wh*remongers a.k.a. the MPAA and the BBFC (who at this point BOTH need to be given their marching orders), the more they'll keep crossing the line, resulting in screwing up society further still. The power to improve the quality of viewing material (or listening material) is in your hands. Use it. And, my advice is see this movie, if you must....BUT...for the love of common sense DON'T PAY anything to see it. It's up to you though...","

"tankace","16 June 2016","X-men Days of Future Past is the best X-men Movie of the main series and second if you count Deadpool. It is based in the comic of the same name and for those in the loop here is the basic story. After devastating War against the Sentinels ,robots programmed to hunt mutants, the team of the X-men sends Wolverine back in time in order to stop the cause of the fight from ever happening and by that preventing the War from occurring.The future itself is terrifying and comparing it with the mid seventies,where Logan has gone, makes you wander how an action decades before a tragedy can make or prevent the event. In the seventies also we meet the main cast of the characters of the First Class and thanks to Wolverine they are completed in the persons we all know and love. Personally after seen the flick for a third time I think that this is a Mustique film because her characters' actions show if we humans can become better or not and I really liked the portrait of Lawrence ,she is the end all Mustique ,from point of view. Pity that after the newest film she will leave the role, but she at least gave us a career define role.Although the director has made some changes of the original comic the basic is there and Singer adds something more : Hope. Apart from time travel, the fear created by racism , amazing action and see both the previous cast and the new in the big screen, this X-men movie has based on hope for the future ,hope for no matter how bad it gets we can still find a solution and as Patrick Stuart himself said in the movie: ""If someone lose his path does not mean that he will stay lost"" .In the end I love this flick and is my favorite comic book movie of 2014 ,even more than the Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy! With Bryan Singer on the director chair I feel safe that Apocalype will be good and the main cast are as solid choices as they get ,so Mutant and Proud comic and in general geek comrades :) !!!","

"joeoriordan0","22 May 2014","I went with medium expectations, and this film blew me away!!! the action scenes were thrilling and exciting, the spectacle epic and exhilarating and the acting top notch!!! The complex plot of the film worked, because X-Men fans will geek out. This film is an absolute blast, a popcorn blockbuster for the ages. It is explosive, emotional , awesome. Although it can get a little slow at times, and the film isn't as dark as it's said to be. The stakes are very high and the film is quite suspenseful and shocking at times. But in the end this film is an epic 3D special effects extravaganza with brains and emotion seriously this film is mind blowing.","

"D4V1D2411","5 April 2022","This movie is not only an amazing superhero movie, but also an amazing movie overall, the story is managed in an almost perfect way, it has some details that can annoy people that do know the timeline of the X-men movies, but those are very few and samll to even matter. This movies ending would have served as the perfect ending for this saga of X-men, and I say this because what they did in the next two, kinda changes this ending, and I think a better option would have been a reboot, with this being its own little saga. Still, those arent issues with this movie, this movie is near perfect in every way. The Best X-men movie.","

"drawlife","2 August 2014","Solid.Right when the movie started, and the beginning credits contained that original X2: X-Men United score, I got a huge feeling of nostalgia and I knew I was in for a ride. Bryan Singer pretty much fixes up most of the wrongs of the horrid X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This film uses time travel quite well, it's consistent and flows along very well. We spend a lot of time with Wolverine, Beast, Mystique, young Xavier and young Magneto. They all play an integral part into the story, and we get into the meat of things when Mystique is responsible for the creation of a new type of Sentinels that adapt to each mutant's power, effective killing them faster. The Sentinels created by Bolivar Trask also have the ability to target anyone that has the capability of passing on the mutant gene. It's why in the future, the Sentinels pretty much took over the planet, killing off everyone. I loved seeing the future scenes with the Sentinels destroying the whole X-Men team. I loved all the action set pieces, and the visuals. Quicksilver in particular had a very memorable sequence in the film, despite his lame looking outfit. It was brilliantly executed and edited. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender display their fine acting as Xavier and Magneto. Here we see the friction between the two and it's displayed very well. Jennifer Lawrence has a lot more to do as Mystique this time around and her character is fleshed out more. Do I need to tell you Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine? There was a point in the film where there are some slow moments, but most of them are decent character moments, especially between Xavier and Magneto. Even though she is fleshed out a lot more than the pervious installments, all the Mystique subplots and elements to me slowed the film down, and didn't find at all interesting. The movie also keeps reminding you that Mystique is the key to the new Sentinels over and over again. Peter Dinklage is good with what he's given with, but with so many characters within the film, it comes within the territory that his role is nothing more than a two-dimensional villain. The time travel element worked really well, near the end, the climax of the film, thats where it becomes a bit choppy in the editing. Normally that worked for me most of the time, but there is a portion in the film where is so abrupt that it took out of the film here and there.You can tell this movie has Bryan Singer's touch. It revitalizes the whole franchise. It re-writes all the wrong of X-Men: The Last Stand and some of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I LOVED seeing Cyclops and Jean Gray back alive. FINALLY the whole X-Men team is back. So great. I do hope they make an appearance in the sequel. With that being said, stay after the credits. APOCALYPSE!!! 7/10","

"jul-kinnear","19 June 2014","This film is a hot mess of goings-on that challenge viewers to various degrees for their attention. And in many ways, these efforts are rather successful. Whether you will enjoy this film lies in whether this is an experience you will be all right with. In director Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, we as viewers deal with the presence of two series worth of X-Men casts, a time travel story that forces viewers to juggle a number of plot points in lieu of a more fluid plot, a splattering of subtle references to other elements from the X-Men universe, as well as a mélange of historical and cultural references — some of which exist in a retroactive continuity thanks to the humans with mutant abilities and the effects of their presence in the world.Even though it had been a decade since Bryan Singer directed an X-Men film (2003's X2), he does so here with the confidence and ability a dedicated expert. Singer had a difficult job in reconciling conflicts of story continuity between the first three X-Men films, the Wolverine films, and the series' most recent instalment before this, X-Men: First Class. But Singer manages to bring everything together and adjust the details so that they make sense for the most part.More committed fans of the franchise and the comic books will probably take issue with conflicts that would be more glaring to them, but as a general movie-going experience, the film is far from unpleasant. In fact, it's rather exciting. It's a time-travelling adventure, and as such, it carries with it consequences on a scale much grander than previous films in the franchise. This film creates much grander stokes befitting a world filled with super-human beings. It also jumps ahead in creating what feels like a much more expansive mutant-filled universe that has been around for much longer than we viewers have seen up to this point — especially if we consider the post-credits scene and the deep implications it carries, which viewers familiar with the X-Men comic book universe will instantly understand.The plot of the film itself is adapted from one of the comic book franchises most legendary story arcs. It's a story from 1981 where mutants in the future are hunted to near-extinction. A member of the X- Men travels back in time so they may alter history. The heart of the film is easily the interplay between the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the young Erik Lensherr, or ""Magneto"" (Michael Fassbender), as they struggle in a heart-wrenching back-and-forth over the troubles their friendship faces and their hopes for the future of mutant-kind. Their future counterparts, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, accomplish much to convey the grim and dire situation their young selves fight to erase. There's a tone in this movie unmatched by any of the other occasions where these actors have portrayed these characters on film.Ellen Page, in her role as ""Kitty Pryde,"" is worthy to further recognition as well. Her character, whose ideas and power prove to be a lynchpin to the whole movie's plot, is an intelligent, brave, fearless soldier who proves herself to be just as multidimensional in character as any of the actors and characters that have come before her in this film franchise. Plus, Peter Dinklage, of Game of Thrones fame, makes for a curious villain, as he not only seeks to eliminate mutant-kind but also proves at the same time to be fascinated by them, making him far from the one-dimensional villain many feared he would be. Ultimately, it may be Jennifer Lawrence as the ever-popular character ""Mystique"" who steals the show. She's just as much a lynchpin to this cast as Ellen Page, exercising her well-established acting skills with wildly successful finesse and depth of emotion.The plot of X-Men: Days of Future Past is easily the most satisfying in the franchise's history — and the most fluid. It drops the need to reintroduce old characters, doesn't spend too much time on new characters, and moves immediately towards the plot that carries this film towards its end. This approach reflects self-confidence in the film franchise, as it assumes fans who are familiar with the series are in fact familiar with the series. The franchise is so popular that it doesn't have to spend much time re-introducing characters and recapping previous events in the franchise. Perhaps this is a presumptuous move, but it proves very helpful in terms of efficient plot delivery. It uses the audience's presumed fandom to move faster and go further than it could if it were continually stopping to reintroduce characters and explain the setting — which is good, because this instalment is perhaps the most narrative-driven. The downside to this is approach is that this makes the film less of a movie to new fans and crafts itself more towards as product for returning fans.In the end, the film is definitely worth the price of admission. It makes for an adventurous, fantasy-filled piece of alternative history storytelling and emotionally compelling action.","

"thommy741","9 June 2014","If you plan on watching a X-Men movie you expect some cool and latest-technology special effects, some great combat scenes in which mutants with crazy powers use whatever ability they're feeling like and of course some cold-blooded drama that sometimes is based on some real issues society faces (more often the movies ask ""How society treats minorities""). X-Men ""Days of Future Past"" has it all .... and so much more! Almost every line spoken is excellent and deeply important and the team of actresses and actors is absolutely stunning. I can't remember the last time I've seen a movie in which every actor/actress does their absolute best to achieve entertainment on such heights. If I'd want to find a fault in this movie it'd just be how the ending is so big of a plot-twist (which can be foreseen right from the start) that it greatly influences every single X-Men movie you have seen so far. If you like X-Men, you'll love ""Days of Future Past"".","

"sanddragon939","1 June 2014","One of the most eagerly awaited superhero films of the decade (if not, like, EVER), 'X-men Days of Future Past' certainly hasn't been crushed by the weight of ginormous expectations placed on it - rather, it has far surpassed those expectations to become one of the greatest comic- book films of all time. In my opinion, DOFP may well lay claim to inclusion in an elite club of superhero films that includes The Dark Knight and The Avengers.Indeed, Bryan Singer's task in DOFP was far more ambitious in some ways than Joss Whedon's mission with 'The Avengers'. This time, it wasn't a bunch of superheroes that had to be united on screen, but rather two disparate franchises within the X-men franchise - the world of the original X-men trilogy (with Jackman, Stewart, McKellan et. all), and the 'prequel' world of 'X-men First Class (with Hoult, Fassbender, McAvoy et. all). And he does so masterfully, uniting the two eras of the franchise into one cohesive whole...further developing the younger cast of 'First Class' while also giving a fitting tribute to the ones who started it all.Hugh Jackman of course is the star of the movie, who literally bridges the two casts just as his character Wolverine uses time-travel to bridge the two eras. But the true protagonist of this film is James McAvoys's younger Charles Xavier. In 1973, Charles is a far cry from the wise mentor and leader embodied by Patrick Stewart - he is a tortured soul, a drug-addict who has numbed his mutant powers in order to be able to sleep peacefully, a man who has seemingly lost his purpose. In an interesting inversion of their relationship from the original films, Logan is forced to mentor the young Charles and set him down the path to becoming the legendary Professor X. Michael Fassbender does a great job as the younger, more militant Eric Lensherr/Magneto. And Jennifer Lawrence's Raven/Mystique is of course the lynchpin of the film's time- travel plot. When we last saw her in 'First Class', she was torn between the opposing paths of Charles and Eric. The original trilogy would have us believe she is destined to become Magneto's ally and fellow mutant terrorist...but if this film teaches us anything, its that the 'future is not set'...Despite the focus on the 'First Class' cast (Wolverine notwithstanding), many of the characters from the original cast get their moments to shine in the midst of the final desperate battle with the mutant-killing Sentinels-most notably Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde, Patrick Stewart's older Professor X, and Ian McKellan's Magneto. Also, while the film in many ways functions as a direct sequel to 'First Class', owing partly to the time-travel plot and partly to the return of franchise creator Bryan Singer, this film feels more or less like a spiritual sequel to X2 - from the use of the soundtrack of that movie, to a number of homages and callbacks to that movie.On the whole, DOFP is both an ending and a beginning (a fitting thing for a time travel movie to be!) and leaves you excited for the next installment in this, the longest-running superhero franchise ever!","

"xlars","30 August 2014","Yes it is. Truly. The very best of the X-men franchise that has been made. It remains to be seen whether X-men: Apocalypse can top it.Not merely because of the plot.Not merely because of the acting.Not merely because of the special effects.But most of all because of the philosophical ideas included in the plot. There are so many viewpoints here, that it is almost as watching a chess game between two world champions. Both of them may be several possible drafts ahead in time, awaiting the next move from their competitor.Yet we, as viewers, do not know what will happen next.Remember Queen? «...sitting on the edge of your seat?»This is it.Enjoy.","

"Dominic_25_","24 April 2023","I had only seen this film once before, as I wasn't very interested in seeing the X-Men reboot franchise. Though I did like this when I finally did watch it, but I was never interested in revisiting it due to how bad the rest of these films were. Now I might actually like this one enough to watch it on its own.After having gone through the original trilogy, the first film in the reboot trilogy, and the first two Wolverine spinoffs, having it culminate in this almost makes all those hours worth it. Almost being the keyword there as you can probably get away with just knowing what happens in all of the preceding films then going straight into this without actually rummaging through that trash. Maybe it's worth watching a couple of those installments to give you some connection to these characters but that's a maybe.The original trilogy is carried by Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman. And they are all present here alongside some supporting cast members that really just make for fan service (but in a good way). Most of the campiness from those films is gone from this one but they keep the undertones of queer and oppressed community struggle. Most importantly they seem to just forget everything stupid that happened in the third film, which I am a huge fan of. They even sort of brought back the father-daughter dynamic between Rogue and Wolverine.The soft reboot trilogy's first installment was really built around the personalities of its characters and making them feel like a team. Having done that hard work, it really pays off here because most of this film is spent in that universe with those characters and their struggles between each other. And this crossover film turns that soft reboot into a full reboot, which opens the door for more exploration of these characters.Wolverine installments are really just kind of forgettable. They exist to show us his violence on display in pg-13 while giving us a peek into his traumatic past.How this film does time travel is really cool to me (even though it doesn't seem like the future and past move at the same rate). I am usually not a fan of the concept and it always feels silly how it's done but I actually liked it in this film.It also doesn't escape me that this film has Bryan Singer's name plastered all over it and features Elliot Page given what he has revealed about his experiences in Hollywood before transitioning. Giving a film a positive rating after knowing so much context is always difficult for me to do and I always factor that into my reviews and general consumption of all media.That being said I don't want to disrespect the many hundreds of people that it takes to make films. And in this film's case they made a good movie despite the presence of Singer.I liked what this film did with all three universes but the dark stain on it will unfortunately keep me from going back for too many rewatches. This was absolutely the best Fox X-Men film made up to this point.","

"nicolechan916","5 November 2014","Having only watched one of the previous X-Men films, I wasn't really expecting much. But after watching this, it rekindled the little kid in me that used to watch the animated X-Men shows on television. It was great to see all kinds of mutants (and actors/actresses) with different powers, even though I didn't know their background. Cool stuff. The visuals and effects were really well done. It seemed like a more mature film than I had imagined based on the previous films.The acting too was on point, everyone played their parts and got into their characters really well. At one point I even consciously acknowledged this when McAvoy as Xavier was concentrating really hard and you could see the vein on his forehead bulge out. The character developments was also well explored and it showed on screen. The character of Quicksilver was a really good addition. He added a comedic effect and the slow motion scenes were great and accurately complimented the character.However there are quite a few things I have a problem with, mainly with the plot. It seemed a bit too easy for Wolverine to convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to believe him, when he didn't really do much himself. And why are Xavier and Magneto the only ones ageing? There's a strong difference between the characters from the past and present..hmm now that I think about it, it's probably because the rest of the mutants weren't in the present (with the exception of Wolverine who's immortal). OK like I said, I didn't watch the other films. I'm wanting to now though.Anyway, it was a really cool film, with cool characters and a kind of cool plot. It's just that it kind of made everything seem...redundant. If you've watched it, you'll get what I mean.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com","

"fredschaefer-406-623204","26 May 2014","X-MEN:DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really brings the franchise back in a big way after the sour taste many fans had after LAST STAND and WOLVERINE:ORIGINS, which most felt were lackluster. X-MEN:FIRST CLASS did a good job of getting the series back on track, but many of us were left with the notion there was work left to do. After seeing Bryan Singer's DAYS OF FUTURE PAST I can say with certainty that this is the best X-Men movie of them all and a real contender for best comic book movie ever-although THE DARK KNIGHT and THE AVENGERS are still very much in contention for the title. What makes DAYS OF FUTURE PAST so great:It perfectly expresses the idea that as a group, the X-Men are the down and dirty combat grunts of the comic universe. The Avengers and the JLA are made up of A list heroes, world beaters who come together in the face of some titanic threat, while the mutants are scrappy misfits, many of them with working class origins and with more than a few neurotic personalities and issues among themselves, but except for the Fantastic Four, they are more of a family than any of the others. They use stealth whenever possible and are not afraid of being underhanded if that is what is takes to get the job done. It unites both the universes of the early X-Men films and the later FIRST CLASS and brings back Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, along with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, as they desperately try to rewrite history from the vantage point of a hellish future ruled by the mutant killing Sentinels. They also put Hugh Jackman's Wolverine back front and center in the action as it is his consciousness that is sent back to his 1973 body, where he will try to unite Professor Xavier and Magneto and prevent the murder of the Sentinel's inventor, Bolivar Trask, by Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique, which sets in motion events that will lead to the genocide of the mutants. All the previous X-Men films are referenced and virtually every character in the franchise makes an appearance at some point. This leads to a few inevitable logic and plot holes, the kind that drive some fans up the wall and across the ceiling- how is Professor X alive and in Patrick Stewart's body in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST when everyone saw him utterly destroyed by Jean Grey in LAST STAND? Not even the post credit scene from that film would explain it. Fight scenes that come as close as any movie to truly capturing the feel of the epic battles of the comics; I'm specifically talking about the battle in the future that opens the movie where the surviving X-Men including Bishop, Storm, Iceman, Blink, Sunspot, and Warpath take on a squad of Sentinels. Each mutant's power is highlighted, but I really liked the way Blink used her portals to give the X-Men an edge. Then there is the scene where we see the action from the point of view of Evan Peters's Quicksilver as he moves so fast that everything else, including bullets speeding through mid air, appear to stand still. This might be my favorite scene from any comic book movie ever.How it rectifies some mistakes of the past: Welcome back Jean Grey and Cyclops; their reunion scene with Wolverine at the end was the icing on the cake for me. And then there is Richard Nixon pulling a gun.Of course some characters didn't get as much screen time as I would have hoped-Oscar Sy as Bishop, Hallie Berry back as Storm, Booboo Stewart as Warpath, Adnan Canto as Sunspot, and especially Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who nearly steals the film. Peter Dinkledge could have been been given some better lines as Bolivar Trask, the movie's main bad guy, since we know what he can do on GAME OF THRONES. And the logic holes,it wouldn't be a comic book movie without them, like how could Ellen Page's Rogue keep contact with Wolverine's consciousness in the past for days on end? Maybe time moves at a different pace in the future. And maybe Charles Xavier is using his highly developed powers of telepathy to make everyone see him in Patrick Stewart's body or it really was his twin brother who was comatose at the end of LAST STAND. As for the post credit scene, everyone had better go read THE AGE OF APOCALYPSE and get up to speed.","

The game adaptation is more worthy than that crap of a film.2011's X-MEN: First Class is also horrible. Even the handsome Michael Fassbender couldn't save the crappy film.2013's Wolverine, gosh! Poor storyline! Absolutely worse than a piece of metal crap! The metal Wolfie goes to Japan, sloppy, shaggy, and brokenhearted after the love loss, and gets hooked up with a Japanese chick on the rebound.So, after the torment of X-MEN Origins. First Class, and Wolverine, the 3 pieces of crap, I have extremely low expectations on Days of Future Past.It turned out to be rather amazing! So nice to see Jean Grey again. and so many old friends and familiar faces! So nice to have a good storyline that is intriguing! Thanks to Bryan Singer's return!

"Dannyboi94","12 June 2016","I have never been a full X-Men fan, I have enjoyed each one of them, with the exception of Wolverine Origin (which was garbage). First Class was a great reboot of the franchise, but I never thought the sequel to that would as as great as it was.Right off the bat, you are thrown into a fantastic story-line that draws you in. Seeing the old cast along side the new, was spine-tingling. The futuristic themes of this film work very well, and the film is edited perfectly to merge and blend the past and future. There is next to no complaints I have about this film, while this isn't the realistic superhero movie you would see in the Dark Knight trilogy, this film most definitely matches it in terms of emotional impact and entertainment,The acting has never been so good in an X-Men film like here, every single actor in this film gives a top-notch performance, with James McAvoy being the stand-out. Jennifer Lawrence is also fantastic here, and it was good seeing her as the character blue Mystique rather than Jennifer we see in the first one. It is difficult to say who the main villain of this film is, as there is many to choose from, but Magneto does a great job.Quicksilver is in this movie, and despite his limited screen-time, he gives the best scene in the film. The action is also very good as well, with no shaky cam, and no serious fast cuts. This is the best X-Men film so far, and a perfect superhero movie.9.6/10","

"fpurify","25 May 2014","I won't disparage anyone for what they find enjoyable. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. That being said, here is mine...The hallmark of an intellectually insulting film is when, early in the movie, each of the main characters stands around in a single room reciting one-liners that give away the entire plot. That happens about five minutes into Days of Future Past and serves as a staggering reminder that this ultimately is a movie for kids.Along the same vein, it would take the film watching experience of a child to not recognize that DOFP is basically an unoriginal mash-up of better films that came before it (the most obvious ripoffs being Back to the Future, Terminator 2, and The Matrix).In fact, DOFP is nothing more than a mutant version of Back to the Future, with fewer memorable lines, mediocre acting (save for the always excellent Michael Fassbender), without the classic soundtrack, and with no real villain.**Spoiler Alert** Plot Synopsis: The Matrix, I mean, DOFP, starts with the all-powerful Sentinels having basically destroyed civilization and terrorizing the mutants who remain in Zion, I mean whatever city they live in. Withing five minutes, we find out that a mutant has the ability to allow others to time travel, but that the farther back in time someone travels, the more difficult it is for Ellen Page to hold it all together. Of course, Wolverine is the only one who is strong enough to make the trip. Why are they time traveling? The Terminator, I mean, Wolverine, has to see to it that Sarah Connor, I mean, Raven/Mystique, doesn't kill The Brother From Another Planet, I mean Joe Morton, I mean the guy who creates Sentinels. What else happens in the movie? Nothing of consequence. A lot of running around, chasing, breaking into stuff, and a melodramatic half love-story involving an apparently alcoholic, depressed, and pathetic Professor X and Mystique.Surely someone out there understands my POV. Again, I respect everyone's opinion, but when I googled DOFP after seeing it and saw a 8.7 rating on IMDb (plus a 91% of RT), my eyes almost fell out of my head.Background/Disclaimer: I did not grow up reading comics. I occasionally watched, and enjoyed, the X-Men cartoon of the '90s. I have seen X-Men (really good), X2 (amazing), The Last Stand (disappointingly awful), and portions of First Class (no opinion).","

"achyutaghosh","23 May 2014","Watching an X-Men movie always felt like putting on a pair of old shoes. They are predictable yet makes for a comfortable viewing. 2011's X-Men: First Class was actually first class, reinvigorating a franchise that had kind of lost its shine. It explored the origins of the mutant superheroes and villains, and a youthful, talented cast multiplied its impact. But what of the actors in the older series? They never achieved any real closure. So out comes Bryan Singer with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which with its past and future backdrop, effectively serves as a bridge between the two different star casts. Two movies for the price of one? Read on.""So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?"" – Charles XavierIn the X-Men universe, the future is dystopian. War has erupted between humans and mutants, with the former close to annihilating the latter with their terrible weapon- the Sentinel robots. In addition to shape shifting, the Sentinels unique strengths include locating any mutant, and the ability to absorb and use mutant powers. The mutants do fight back, but it is useless as shown in the first few minutes of the movie. The futility of their actions do highlight the ingenuity of their solution- changing the past, terminator style, to protect the future. The Sentinel robots came into existence on public support because Mystique assassinated its creator, Bolivar Trask, and they gained their shape-shifting abilities from Mystique herself, who was captured. So The Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his groovy younger self, back in 1973, just before that fateful incident. He has to convince a younger professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto, among others, of the apocalyptic future, and work together to prevent the assassination.The cast is gargantuan- Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore and Nicholas Hoult reprise their roles with familiarity, while Peter Dinklage as Trask is their pint sized yet towering adversary. The visual effects are spectacular, and for a movie about people with superhuman abilities, the movie though is more about the human in them. The script is witty, the screenplay is tight, the music is apt, and though the premise is ridiculous, anyone stepping into the theater know what X-Men are after all, a figment of our imagination. Despite Jackman's imposing physique, Lawrence's beauty and Fassbender's charisma, to me though the standout character was Quicksilver (comics) played by American Horror Story's Evan Peters, the Marvel version of The Flash. A smarty-pants, super-speed endowed kleptomaniac (""Prison break? That's illegal, you know""), he probably gets the best sequence in the film shot from his perspective in which everything else in the world moves so slowly- a super slow 3000 frames per second round the room shot while he moves at warp speed to rearrange bullet trajectories among other things. Pity though he disappears after that. If I were to nitpick, I think Bryan Singer has committed the same mistake that he did in Superman Returns- for a movie that is touted as an epic battle for survival, the action is too little. Agreed Magneto gets to lift up a stadium among other things, but unlike the action in Avengers, which left a satisfied feeling, I felt a bit cheated here, wanting more.In the end though, X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is entertaining, absolutely reveres its characters and makes the only truth in comic book world- that anything is possible, believable. 9/10","

"cathalokane","3 July 2014","I only just about made it to the end of this film. In some respects I'm glad I waited it out as I always enjoy seeing Magneto rise up and wreak havoc in any format.It was a close run thing however - I came very close to cutting my losses as we all had to endure the tiresome emotional crisis of the young Professor X. This film suffers from the blight of a tedious extended middle section where not an awful lot interesting actually happens - and there are prolonged periods of uninspiring dialogue. I found my mind wandering in the cinema as the director laboriously set up the clunky plot climax. It was all a bit tiresome.One always needs to leave one's brain at the door in this type of film and that's OK, it's what we all expect, but I was expecting this film to outdo the other incarnations of the X-Men given the things I had read, and the glowing recommendations I got from colleagues.Sadly it's all a bit pedestrian, and when you find yourself fidgeting and looking at your watch in the middle of an X-Men film you know that something has gone wrong somewhere. There are excellent performances here and there. Fassbender continues to ooze screen charisma and he captures the ruthless single mindedness of Magneto wonderfully well. Jackman continues to make Wolverine his own, but aside from that there's not really much memorable here.This is the first X-Men I have gone to see in the cinema and I think it will be my last.","

"zacpfox","15 January 2022","I am going to put this out there and say that the previous X-Men films have missed the mark when it comes to any sort of emotion. What we have been left with is a brutish clash of superpowered beings, loosely held together by Professor X.Days of future past, however, is another league entirely. While it still contains the characteristic marvel glitter and sparkles, the underlying plot and the performances are as moving as they are interesting. The performance from Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy were nothing short of brilliant, two very different interpretations of the same character yet surprisingly believable.Peter Dinklage was a star; his suavity and maleficence was on point, knowing he had the spotlight and using that to the extreme.Another overproduced sci-fi superhero movie? Perhaps. But this time, it had the substance to back it up.","

"dlpburke","8 June 2014","Unless you are one of these people still dazzled by fight scenes and graphics, this film will be very average for you. 7/10 is about the most I would expect any sane person to bestow upon this (and IMDb has proved yet again that there are far more stupid people about than intelligent ones).Firstly, when going into a film based on a comic book, you have to extend your suspension of disbelief. If I came into this review lambasting the far fetched powers, then that would be rather silly. Although X-Men is based in our world, being a comic book, it is afforded some leeway. Even so, I would just like to point out that much of what goes on in the X-Men is scientifically impossible, so I don't rate it as a sci-fi... more a sci-fantasy.I won't go into a big review with this film, because I don't think it really deserves that much attention. Instead, I will summarize: The Good: 1. The film is mostly well paced (apart from that stupid video game sequence at the start).2. The acting is good.3. The visuals are good. One scene in particular, which is in slow motion (you will know what I mean when you see it), is pretty cool and well made.4. The characters are likable.The Bad: 1. The X-Men's abilities are far too powerful, especially Magneto's. Not only does it come across as laughable, some of the things they achieve, but more importantly, it breaks the tension. Instead of fearing the worst for our heroes and for their future, we are constantly allowing for an 'anything can happen' scenario. There is one part of the movie where Magneto lifts a giant structure (no spoilers) off the ground like it is a piece of play-doh. That's all well and good, but without a shred of believability (even for X-Men), and without seeing some sort of limit to these powers, there is no dramatic tension. The movie does at least place limits on some of the other characters... for a time.2. The plot is very basic. When I found out this film had a time travel element, I was interested. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted here, so don't go into this movie expecting some really well written time travel stuff. The way in which the time travel works in this film is not original either (despite some claims), and has been done countless times before- for example in Babylon 5 (my favourite show, and infinitely better written than this). The general plot is way too simplistic. The pacing may be decent, but the story just plods along. No decent twists or parts where you have to engage your brain. It's just auto-pilot storytelling.3. JFK was killed by Oswald. I am sick and tired of seeing conspiracy garbage portrayed as reality. If you are a logical person, and have done proper research, you will come to the sane conclusion that Oswald did it. The odds on it not being him are astronomical, based on the wealth of evidence that exists. The film does include a twist in this regard, but it's an absolutely absurd twist.4. Evolution does not work like this film supposes. There are too many writers out there that have no idea how it works, or how science in general works. When dealing with a film like the X-Men, you'd think they would hire proper advisers.Overall, I was disappointed with the film, but it was still worth the watch, and the day out to the cinema. 6/10","

"rprince-832-6294","24 May 2014","X-Men: Days Of Future Past review: -So X-Men: Days Of Future Past is the 7th X-Men movie (if you include The Wolverine) which sees mutants in a losing war in the future with the Sentinels. To save themselves from extinction they send Wolverine's consciousness back to X-Men: First Class to make sure that X-Men: The Last Stand and Brett Ratner never happened! -In other news, I have a new favorite X-Men film! X-Men: Days OF Future Past was quite incredible! can't think of a lot to say that is negative, but I will try. Maybe. Probably not.-Story was great. There were a few little things that did not make sense, but they did not matter that much. Also Bryan Singer pulled off making Brett Ratner never happen. Yup!! -Pace was a little slower, and the tone was darker, but they really had to be. It also had an overarching theme of hope which was great.-Cast did great! Everyone was at their best. Peter Dinklage was a great Bolivar Trask! Also James McAvoy is now Professor X the way Martin Freeman is not Bilbo. Yeah everyone was very good.-Music was pretty good. It features some moments that highlight some of the other X-Men scores, which is great! -CG was good. Cinematography and look and everything else was good too.-Content: Pushed its PG-13 rating. Some moderate language with one F-word and some brief partial nudity. Which I expected both of in this based on the other X-Men films.-So, X-Men: Days Of Future Past rocked! I loved seeing the combo of X-Men and X2 with First Class, which are the three I actually liked. I really like that there are going to be more films too! By the way, stay through the credits.-I will sat X-Men: Days Of Future Past deserves a high 8.5. Which means I had to decide if I liked it more than Captain America, which a just barely do. IDK if I like it more than Grand Budapest though. I'll get back to you on that.-So if you like he X-Men series or Marvel movies, you will love this film! Go see it.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","9 September 2014","People walked out of Days of Future Past with one phrase on their lips; ""definitely the best X- Men movie."" With our market over-saturated with Marvel and there being 6 other X-Men movies in the last 15 years, does that sentence really mean anything? Does that make it something of worthy value to cinema? I just wanted to know if it was good on a scale of all movies. The answer is no, but a mild no, I'm still partial to X-Men 2, but while Days of Future Past was entertaining, it's very flawed. First problem is that it doesn't have a first act, it just dives straight in after a huge cringeworthy exposition dump. It's a totally clunky introduction which followed one of their best action sequences in a long time.It takes a long time to sink back into the narrative after a series of painfully bad dialogue that shows a complete lack of confidence. At times it's just way too convoluted, but that might be just because I haven't watched any X-Men movie since First Class and I'm rusty. There's a lot of chronology where I'm not sure what's changed or fixed or whatever. The problem is that the antagonistic force requires a big suspension of disbelief that I'm not prepared to give. It's a film very derivative of its inspirations and in particular in that regard, The Matrix. But predictability aside, it has some very involving and colourful action scenes that make up for any moments where I'm lost.Mutant fighting is always a joy to watch and Fassbender and McAvoy prove their worth as Magnetic and Professor X. I could take or leave the Quicksilver stuff but I get why he's popular. However, the film does do a great job at raising the stakes with a tiny shot of emotional resonance in its biggest moments and I think that's partly why the film works much better than other blockbusters this year, even if its first act misstep shoots itself in the foot. I guess it depends on the backstory from the other movies but I can't quite figure out at what point it's entering from. Days of Future Past is just real easy to watch with plenty of lights (aka crowded with characters) buzzing at once to keep you occupied for two hours. We know what worse looks like anyway.6/10","

"winningdawg","24 May 2014","Simple review of a person who went to the comic book stores since the early 90s.Do Not WASTE Your Money On This Especially in 3D !!!!List of Reasons this was barely bearable to watch:Absolutely Bad Action - Moved like a Drama on Late night (waaay too much dialogue) - Action sequences were not worth $15+ admission prices - Absolutely no character build-up; in a marvel universe where character build-up can be used to enhance the movie experience as a whole. - Very weak use of powers. yea magneto and Raven: Yay for the win, not !! - disjointed character action, people doing things based on a compelling comic series, chopped to bit-scenes, lame - the sentinels look like students did the cgi(even ravens cgi was bad) - useless stretched out conversational scenes, WAAAAY TOOOO LONG (found me dosing off into my own mind wondering ""What the hell are they talking about"",get back to the action)Comparatively does not even hold a candle to the Original X-men Prequel. this was stale movie and i'm mad and wanting my money back. the only thing I will take from this is whoa that was worse compared to the trilogy, and the prequel. maybe worst than the wolverine spin offs.Conclusion: the story was all there (as its all in the comic), but the execution, the execution was a total fecal matter. I think the people in the credits probably all signed in to IMDb on multiple accounts and leave reviews, with more compelling literature that the movie script itself.the only thing that actually hit a nerve was the talk between the old and new Charles Xavier, and oddly was very intrigued by the development of Stryker, everything else was very weak, even wolverines cgi arms or make-up couldn't lift this movie. boy this failed to deliver something that could have been amazing, miscasting, odd character emphasis, Fassbinder couldn't save this sinking ship, ice-man still was bad especially in this one, I still cant help but love captain Piccard as Professor X. everything else is beyond dis-heartening and not worth watching. Do not waste your time or money watch it at home or on cheap day !! -","

"craig-hopton","2 January 2017","A good addition to the X-men franchise. What makes it original is the strong contrast between the future scenes featuring a final band of X-men standing up to the power-absorbing Sentinels, and the scenes from the past featuring a young Xavier and Magneto.The future scenes feature some impressive special effects and earthquakingly powerful mutant-on-Sentinel battles. The opening sequence in particular is a cracker.The scenes set in the past are interesting for their insights into the early years of Xavier and Magneto but don't have the same oomph. James McAvoy is a little too fragile as the young Xavier - he's not a persuasive match for Patrick Stewart and seems to be easily outclassed by the young Magneto.The climax of the movie is a tad pedestrian, but taken as a whole this is worth a watch.","

"AaronRubalcava","5 October 2014","Ahhh the X-men Franchise.There's the good: X-men, X2 and x-men first class and the bad: X3, god dammit Brett Ratner.But with a familiar face returning to the franchise Its easy to say the franchise is being brought to life and exceeding new levels with Days of future past.So as always I will rank this art film as 1.Acting, 2.Plot, 3.Sfx and 4.Flaws, 5:Direction.1:The acting:The acting was superb.Hugh Jackman is as good as always playing the 6 foot 3 Canadian with anger issues.Micheal Fassbender and especially James McAvoy gave praising performances as the younger counterparts of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.Micheal Fassbender shows how cold and calculating Magneto is making him the bad-ass super villain.James McAvoy gave a shuddering performance as a broken down Charles Xavier who's lost his way.Evan Peters was great as the speedy quicksilver(I doubt avengers 2 quicksilver will beat this one)who stole the show for the part he was given.Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the troubled Mystique.10/10 2.The Plot:In 2023, the mutants face the biggest threat yet:the sentinels, which are mutant killing robots made by Bolivar Trask, 50 years ago.The sentinels are so advanced that they adapt to any mutant power.So what do they have to do to stop the massacre?They have to send the Wolverine back to the past to change the future.Sounds good right?10/10 3.SFX:The GCI was simply stunning.The sentinels (both future and past)looked amazing.The mutant powers were awe strucking(especially quicksilver's superhuman speed).10/10 4.Flaws:Although the X-men franchise is pretty flawed some things were explained.Like how Charles could walk.How Hank Mcoy was still human in X2.But some questions remain unanswered.Like did Logan ever undergo the weapon X procedure?How is professor X still alive?Well we still have X-men:Apocalypse coming up so they might be awnsered.9/10 5.The direction:After 3 blockbuster movies, it really shows how Bryan Singer knows how this team of outcasts functions(Not you, Brett Ratner).He really knows how this team works and there's heart in this film (unlike the Avengers).There's a right amount of action, dialog and emotion to this film.Worth buying.Overall:10/10.This flick is a perfect blend of everything.Even if your-re not a fan of superhero movies this one is still going to surpass your expectations.Its worth it.Cant wait for Apocalypse, Bryan Singer.","

"Blazs91","29 September 2014","First of all, I need to clarify, that I barely able to watch any Marvel movie. Not because consider them bad. No! Not at all! All of them are high quality productions of the Hollywood film factory. Despite of that I've seen all the X-Men movies so far, and after watching the First Class I couldn't wait for this one. And it totally worthed it!The story is well-presented, I was fairly delighted with the whole time-traveling idea. Although there were some loops in it, but I do not want to mention them for now. The acting performance is can said to be almost beyond compare, apart from a few exceptions. Magneto was great and almighty, Mystic was graceful and sexy as hell, Wolverine was pure Wolverine, etcetera, etcetera. We had the honorable opportunity to meet with quicksilver, who I bet is gonna be the favorite character of everybody. He was cool and hilarious, and you would want to spend more and more time with watching him in real- time"" action.Michael Fassbender just became eligible enough to get a goddamn Ocsar at last! He's just killed his character! Magneto has almost never been so original than this time! I think I'm gonna sit down and write an anthem for him after I finished my review.The visuals boosted with 3D were phenomenal. Especially I've fallen in love with the chick with teleportation ability. That just has made the action sequences simply so creative and cool! The robots were also well-designed and bad-ass, and this is the movie, in which cannot see a little drop of blood, but the fighting scenes create a so brutal atmosphere, that it could almost hurt us, when we can witness a character's death. The robots are tearing the mutants into pieces and beating the s**t out of them with no mercy. The five minutes long introducing scene was almost smashed my 3D glasses. So the visuals are absolutely great, and they can make us feel the tension and pressure on our shoulders, what the mutants are bearing too.Is this movie faultless? Nope! One of my main problem was Wolverine, sorry folks! We can him on screen far more than any other (more important) characters, and most of the time he didn't do anything special. I don't understand why the makers of the movie wanted to sell their product to us with Wolverine. They could have done him without him too. This man didn't managed to make any successful conversation, and I felt that his only role was to show his abs and unrealistically aesthetic body in the first half of the movie, because Jackman has never been ripped as hard as now. The dialogs are painfully simple, and movie gets started slightly sluggishly because of that. But it's only a really tiny mistake.Mystic! She is so attractive and charming, but that's the problem. She was put right into the focal point of the movie, but the primal purpose was to show her naturally elegant physique, so aesthetics again. I bet the male members of the audience cannot take in what really happens when she is on the screen, because the sight of her naked blue body and her extremely cool and jaunty fighting moves. I consider it another tiny mistake, but I must admit that I totally loved it!  Mystics other mistake is that she could be easily manipulated. Her decisions are hardly influenced by the decisions of the other male characters. But why? She could have been a separately intelligent character, who can take things in her hands and manage them effectively.Despite of the mistakes in the characters, the movie manages them very well. I mean that every character has its own personality, own purpose, own beliefs, which are varying from one to another. And this the secret of the perfect editing! There are several female and male characters, but we cannot consider any of them evil or good. The movie provides the option for each individual member of audience to personally choose who he/she wants to be the good guy and who to be bad guy. All characters are fighting for his/her noble goal, and I've changed my side severally during the story.Overall, this movie is epic and MARVELOUS! The music composition was excellent, totally fitted into the environment. The humorous moments were hilarious, the fighting moments were savage and cruel, the sentimental moments were emotional enough. So almost every details were appropriately accomplished. All my respect for the crew!Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!","

"The_Film_Cricket","24 May 2014","X-Men: Days of Future Past is like the world's most dazzling wedding cake. It's so pretty, and even breathtaking, that it is easy to lose sight of the fact that what's on the inside is not nearly as impressive as what's on the outside. It colorful, it's fun, but don't look too deeply or you'll begin to find cracks in its impressive facade.That doesn't mean it's not entertaining. You definitely get your money's worth, but story-wise it isn't going to rank with the best of the recent flood of comic book movies. After the great urgency of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the lovely intimate love story of The Amazing Spiderman 2, this new X-Men movie feels a little stiff in the story department. It is not, however, stiff in it's ambitions. The X-Men series has always been willing to try something new. Thus far, they've tried one-offs, and prequels, and now they're throwing time travel into the mix.The story a lot more complicated than it needs to be. It is based on a 1981 X-Men comic book written by Chris Clairmont and John Byrne that begins in the future when the war between the mutants and an army of Government Sanctioned Shape-changing Giant Killer Robots (say that out loud) has devastated the face of the Earth and driven the few surviving mutant into hiding.Among the surviving few are Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his best frenemy Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) who have gathered the surviving few mutants into hiding to figure out what to do about this situation. Since Kitty Pride (a woefully underused Ellen Page) has the power to mentally sent people through time, Prof gets the brilliant idea to send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the 1970s to stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from ever being developed. *Some spoilers ahead*Logan has some to-do list: 1.) Stop the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots from being built by the government. 2.) Stop Raven Darkhölme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the evil Boliver Trask (Peter Dinkledge) who invented the Government Sanctioned Shape-Changing Giant Killer Robots. 3.) Enlist the help of young Charles Xavier, who has apparently tuned in, turned on, and dropped out. 4.) Locate and retrieve young Magneto who's prison cell is, let's put it this way, not exactly your standard county lock-up.With all of these balls in the air, you can imagine that X-Men: Days of Future Past is one busy little bee, and it is. Director Bryan Singer returns to this series after directing the first two X-Movies (there have now been seven, count 'em, seven), and what he brings with him is a bold spirit of fun. There are set pieces here, especially Magneto's prison break, that are well executed, as are the references to the world of the 1970s, everything from lava lamps to Robert Flack to ""Sanford and Son"" to Pink Floyd.Yet, what the movie lacks is a tightly-written story. The third act, which is impressive on a technical scale, is kind of a disappointment story-wise. Singer's real creativity should be in showing us how past events are effecting the future. Instead, the third act is given over to one of those crash and bash endings that you could see in any big-budget special effects movie. The best time travel movies are always a dizzy display of the past connecting with the future.He's also lacking a timely theme. This first two X-Men movies – which he directed – very effectively dealt with the current issue of acceptance of those that society deems ""freaks."" It was a nice parallel to the current issue of gay rights. Here he's made a much more standard adventure. He has indeed made a special effects wedding cake, one that after a while leaves you craving some meat.","

"vijayant_venky","24 May 2014","First off, I loved it. When I was going into the theatre I really wasn't sure how this one is going to be considering the last Wolverine was a disaster for me. But I did have hopes from this perfect ensemble even though the trailer didn't work for me.X Men – Days of Future Past has everything that an X Men fan loves and longs for. If you loved X Men First Class, this movie is a treat for you and is sure to blow your mind away.Take a bow Bryan Singer for creating and presenting this spectacle to us. Kudos to the director, Bryan, for pulling this off brilliantly because I found the plot to be most complex and yet most entertaining so far! This X Men brings all the great actors from the X Men Trilogy, X Men First Class and others to you and that includes Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence (I am in love with you all over again miss), Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hault, Peter Dinklage of GOT fame, Evan Peters, Josh Helman.I have to admit that I was conspicuous at a lot of times while watching the film and by the end I actually found this flabbergasting a lot more amazing. Why was I flabbergasted? Well because there's time travel, quantum physics and a hell lot of characters (I am not complaining even one bit)The overall plot of the movie can be summed in this next statement. Wolverine is sent by X Men to about 50 years in the past in order to prevent the doom for humans and mutants. In the present, a war between mutants and non-mutants has led to massive destruction in the world. A few mutants who have survived are battling against Sentinels, the terrifying new soldier robots. Professor X played by Patrick Stewart, realizes that time-travel to 1973 could probably save their destinies.Kitty Pryde played by my favorite Ellen Page has the power to take X men into the past and she leverages this power at the command of the Professor X take Wolverine back to 1973. And in just a moment, the X Men go forward to the past or an alternative present. Wolverine is required to stop Mystique, or Raven, beautifully and effortlessly played by Oscar winning actress Jennifer Lawrence with whom I have fallen in love with all over again. Mystique attempts to assassinate the anti-mutant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, at a peace conference in Paris. As things turn out, Mystique is captured and her metamorphic properties were decanted through some horrifying and hideous scientific means.Why does Wolverine need to stop Mystique? So that none of this would happen and the future of humans and mutants is not a dystopia. However he needs Magneto and Xavier's younger selves to join him, however they don't remember or recognise him in the past. What follows is prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong but not when Bryan Singer is at play.There is a particular bullet scene which is created in absolute slow motion and though the creators have done a job worth an applause, I actually didn't find the scene as amusing as my fellow movie watchers in the theater did. In fact to be honest, had the same scene been enacted by an Indian filmmaker, everyone would have laughed it off calling it a Rajnikant stunt.One of my favorite sequence in the movie was the climax sequence wherein an entire stadium is uprooted and fenced around the White House in order to kill the United States President for he is guilty of ordering a Sentinels program aimed at vanishing mutants.Performances are incredible especially by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence who made us believe in each and every emotion of Mystique and we witness each emotion even through the body hugging quasi-nudity and you know there's nothing wrong in being sexy. Though Hugh Jackman was at his best however I really felt that other strong characters and performances did steal the limelight. I wish an astonishing actress like Halle Berry had more screen time but I understand that the writers and Singer wanted to be leal to the script and the plot.The sets, costumes and action sequences are simply out of this world and you will be glued to your sit to not miss even a second of this brilliance put on screen.My recommendation – you have to go and watch this one even if you are not an X Men fan for you will be on the edge of your seat at so many times.","

"BenignPillows","25 May 2014","If you like X1 and X2, you might like this, but if you are a big fan of X-Men First Class, like I am - you should be warned that this is a different animal. I was quite disappointed in this one.The point is: One of Matthew Vaughn's biggest strengths is pacing. Say what you will about him; his movies have a great flow. The same thing, however, seems to be a weakness with Singer. Compared to First Class, this movie was SOOO SLOW. It was badly paced, and it was also heavy-handed, repetitive and sentimental. Not emotional, I like emotional - it was sentimental. Singer is too fond of these characters, especially the old X-men (everything to bring them back!) plus the Charles-Raven-Erik conflict. God, that conflict got tiring! I loved Xavier as the brilliant, funny, warm teacher in First Class. Now he was suddenly ALL ABOUT Raven/Mystique. Ugh! Kill your darlings, Singer! You've lost your critical sense! Quicksilver was one of the few good things about this movie, but he was gone too fast.This movie had some good action scenes and glimpses of humour. And nostalgia, I guess, if you're a big X-men fan. First Class, however, had better pacing, script, score, was much more fun and also more poignant.","

"adrongardner","23 May 2014","Logan has come unstuck in time and he's out to set right what Brett Ratner put very, very wrong. I hope Disney never acquires all the Marvel properties, because if they do, good stories like this will never see the light of day. All Disney Marvel movies consist of pantomime passing as action and flying fortress defense contract builders posing as villains. There are no people in Disney Marvel movies, only rubber suits and cardboard cut-outs.The Avengers was just Transformers. Thor was boring. I can't even recall Captain America and Iron Man 3 was probably the worst movie made in the last ten years. Sony isn't guiltless. Sure these new Spiderman movies are boring and soulless, but Disney is taking the Brett Ratner blow torch approach to everything they touch. The house of the Mouse cares only to serve up toy licensing on the cheap, employing shoddy stories, bad actors and TV directors. Days of Futures Past on the other hand is a pro job. It's made with a degree of dramatic vision, written well and acted impeccably from a true ensemble.The first twenty minutes in Days of Future Past are a little clunky. There's so much story to put into motion, the script almost can't handle it. Soon enough, we meet Quicksliver and it's a lark from there on out. While everybody does pretty good, it's Michael Fassbender and the utterly peerless James McAvoy who anchor this film from start to finish. Sure it's a great story, but much like the last go-around, these two titans carry this film part and parcel to the very end. And boy is there an quadrilateral equine whopper at the end.You simply cannot, and I wager will not, ever see this caliber of acting from any Disney Marvel property ever. Comic books were never truly about monsters, flying fortresses, bulletstorms or magic. In fact the best were always allegory. Marvel never had the big names like Batman and Superman, but they had super heroes, mutants or titans struggling with the same basic things we all do: loss, responsibility, love and doubt. I'm glad to see the team behind Days of Future Past realized that underneath all the rubber suits, even a mutant can be human.","

I rate this higher then all of the other X-Men movies. The humor was perfect in every situation. I cinematic masterpiece.","

"anishwicks","28 August 2014","I expected a lot after reading the reviews and watching the trailers and all but from the minute the movie started I knew that I had been tricked. First of all the beginning of this movie wasn't as great as the beginning of first class. Due to this weak start my expectations for the rest of the movie lowered. A film like this needs a good beginning, which I thought the dark knight movies gave us. Days of future past gives us a very messy start and one might find it hard to concentrate or to watch the beginning because there was too much happening everywhere all together. There's something happening here then something else happens there and then we completely forget what just happened before that.The acting was OK, but the directing was bad. Mostly because it's not possible to see most parts because it's really really dark. I do understand that they've done that on purpose as to show the darkness that there living in but seriously couldn't they make it just a little bit less darker. Also the slow motion, I loved the slow motion in the beginning half of the film. That part was breathtaking and it was one of my favorite parts of the entire movie ( of course I mean the pentagon part). But as you go more and more into the movie you can realize that almost half of the movie is in slow motion, some of it unnecessary.The story was OK. It wasn't thought through well. Firstly it didn't make much sense. The story at the beginning half made it look like the story could have a really good prestige like, shocking ending but ended weirdly and not making sense at all. I have no idea how they are going to make a sequel for this with that ending. If they do make a sequel , I don't think it will have a lot to do with this. Also some parts of the movie were slow making it a bit boring. I really preferred first class in all ways ( this didn't even have any humor at all.) anyways it was watchable but not what you might expect it to be.","

"sujanfaster","23 May 2014","I have always loved the X men franchise. Its always fascinating to see more than 1 super powers in a film. After the ""X men- Last Stand"", the franchisee focused on prequels and sequels(The Wolverine) to connect to this big movie. Bryan Singer back in the director chair gets almost everything right to bring this magnum opus to the big screen.As the title suggests this film's set in the future, which takes us to the past. In the future, both the human and the mutant species are on the brink of extinction due to a war against very powerful weapons sent on mutants to wipe them off the planet. However Charles Xavier and Magneto find a way to prevent that from happening by sending Wolverine into the past to change those events which lead to this war which mainly focuses on the character Mystique. This time Wolverine also has the challenge to convince the unstable Xavier and Magneto of the past and get their help in doing it. The rest is how it is accomplished and what does it change with respect to the present/future. Yes, its complicated. But its fun and we might have all the answers in the coming Xmen movies.Though the movie focuses on Hugh Jackman as a lead character, its a different wolverine we see. Not the irresponsible, easygoing but the mentoring. Hugh Jackman with his beast of a body impresses yet again. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has a meatier role this time and considering the success she's having these days nothing can go wrong for her. James McAvoy, Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen give life to their Magneto and Xavier characters in both the timelines. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is an interesting addition.Since its Xmen there are so many characters and its difficult mentioning each one of them.But I personally felt, Peter Dinklage's acting talent was bit underutilized in his role as Dr.Bolivar Trask. There are some extraordinary action sequences like Quicksilver's ultra speed motion fight, Mystique changing her form on course of the fight and of course some Magneto's powerful scenes.There are hardly any disappointing moments in the movie and you'll come out of the cinema hall with some answers and a lot of questions.Bryan Singer keeps us on our toes and makes us ready and curious for the next movie.","

"Prismark10","31 May 2014","X Men: First Class was a clever re-jigging by having new younger actors playing Magneto and Xavier and focusing on the origins of the X Men. However like last year's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the second film gets away from a fresh page and goes back to its franchise history here we have the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen playing their older selves as past meets the future. It might be because both actors are not getting any younger that the producers decided to accelerate their appearance in the franchise.The glue is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as he travels into the past and prevent Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) killing scientist Trask (anagram of Stark!) By killing Trask (Peter Dinklage) the governments declare war on mutants and develop the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels who have almost wiped out the mutants in the future.As Wolverine returns he see's McAvoy's Xavier, addicted to a serum, drunk and without his powers. Erik is in a maximum security prison but aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik and set about to Paris to stop Raven. The prison escape scene is marvellously done balancing wit and bravado.The film is mainly set in the past as there is distrust and anger between Charles and Erik and whether Erik can be fully trusted. The set pieces are well executed with a balance of wit and pathos. Because of the focus on the newer actors there is little time devoted to the classic X Men actors as they are reduced to almost cameo status.As a stand alone film I found the film enjoyable, its well paced the film hardly misses a beat. You can quibble about the time travel elements and the changing of the time strands. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Jackman all deliver in the acting stakes although surely I cannot be alone in thinking that the ageless Logan is actually looking old.Bryan Singer the returning director of the first two X Men films brings a tight narrative focus and delivers a film with little flab but plenty of fab.","

"3xHCCH","21 May 2014","Powerful Sentinels from Trask Industries were decimating all the mutants, leaving only a handful of the hardiest ones alive. Logan is sent back twenty years into the past during the inception of the Sentinel program, to stop this project before it destroys the mutant race anymore.Young Charles Xavier was up and about but without his powers. Young Eric was incarcerated in a subterranean cell within the Pentagon because on his implication in the JFK assassination. Young Raven/Mystique was intent to kill Trask himself before he kills more mutants. Logan must make them all see how their actions now will impact on the very existence of mutants on Earth in the future.Because this is already the fifth X-Men film, we know each mutant individually and are invested in their collective mythology. This installment gives us further details into the past of each of the main mutants and we see how each one evolves into how we know them in the present time.The visual effects are expectedly awesome. My favorite scene would be the sequence where Charles and Logan attempt to break Eric out if his prison with the help of the super- speed powers of Peter/Quicksilver. The stop-motion, sense of humor and the song ""Time in a Bottle"" in the background makes it very memorable. The other epic sequence was that when an entire sports arena was lifted from its foundations and used to corral the White House itself.The actors we know and loved from all the previous films: Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine), Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier, old and young), Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender (as Eric/Magneto, old and young), Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven/Mystique) -- all do excellently in their respective characters. Nicholas Hoult reprises his role as young Hank McCoy/Beast. There will be shorter and shocking appearances by Halle Berry and Anna Paquin as Storm and Rogue, respectively. Towards the end, there will be surprising cameos by Mutants who had taken already their leave in previous episodesFor the new cast members, Evan Peters shines in his outstanding performance as Quicksilver, a character who was both quick in action and in wit. Ellen Page appears as Kitty Foyle, whose power made it possible for Logan to travel back in time. Newly-featured mutants Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan) get prominent action sequences in the climactic battle sequence.I thought it was an inspired idea to cast Peter Dinklage as the genius scientist Trask. He brings his ""Games of Thrones"" acting intensity into this film in this dark character. It was also interesting to see how Stryker got his sinister character into the X-Men canons. Josh Helman portrays him with the necessary antagonistic swagger.As with the other Marvel films, do wait up for a breathtaking short extra clip of a robed figure in and the Pyramids. This bonus scene teasing the next X-Men film Apocalypse (2016) is seen only after all the credits roll up.This film had so many characters (even former US President Nixon plays a key part) and so many events shuttling from present to past and back. Despite all the potential plot holes a time-travel storyline can present, Director Bryan Singer still manages to tell his story in one cohesive whole. This is yet another excellent proof that the X-Men film franchise is indeed the best among the Marvel collection. 9/10.","

"DonaldDooD","21 July 2014","I'm not a fan of superhero comic books, but I'm not against the idea of superhero movies. Its just that few of them escape the clichés of the hundreds of other actions films out there. The Dark Knight was pretty good half a decade ago (tarnished by edgy teenage misanthropes, but that's not TDK's fault), but since then Marvel and DC either didn't interest me or disappointed. I was mildly interested in seeing this due to its high Rotten Tomatoes score, so I chose this for a movie outing with a friend.It was actually a perfectly solid action flick. I wouldn't say it sets a new bar, but it avoided clichés by focusing on character. In fact, action and character development were evenly matched.The conflict between Professor X and Magneto is done surprisingly well. You wouldn't think a superhero movie would do a good job at showing the clashing sides of moderate vs extremist activism, yet both sides are portrayed realistically. Magneto is villainous, of course, but he's not evil for the sake of evil. Professor X believes that humans can be taught to accept Mutants, yet all their crimes make Magneto convinced only one race should reign on Earth. And its not easy to debunk him. Mystique was also well done, not subservient to either side.There was too much gristle in terms of the number of superheros. Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique are the only vital characters to the plot. Wolverine, Beast, and Kitty Pride serve important roles, but don't have a character arc. Perhaps twice as many characters make cameos, but ultimately are forgettable unless you read the comics. The action never wowed me, personally. Some of parts against the Sentinels were cool, but predictable.Regardless, the characters were strong enough to hold the movie for me. A 7/10 may not seem like much, but its above average. I think it deserves its large box office toll, and I'm curious if the sequel can maintain this quality.","

"justbob1982","13 July 2015","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The X-Men are possibly the ultimate ensemble cast. The central half-dozen have been joined over the years by well over a hundred named characters, each with their own personalities and powers. All the more surprising then that for X-Men: Days of Future Past, they chose a plot that meant doubling up on several characters, bringing together two whole all-star casts into what amounts to an absolute galaxy of stars.Of course, sacrifices must be made to some degree, so the old cast - Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and so on - take something of a back seat as the new group brought in for X-Men: First Class predominate in the drama. This is fine, because Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are all excellent at their craft, and indeed all the best parts of this film come not from spectacle but sizzling character interactions.My sister pointed out that the role of Mystique (Lawrence) in the plot doesn't quite make sense given the existence of Darwin, a character who got inconveniently killed off in First Class. Being honest though, Jennifer Lawrence can now be relied on to carry the focus of a film in a way Edi Gathegi simply can't. Or at least, not yet. There's a slight problem with Professor X too, as Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's versions of the character - both interesting and engaging in themselves - seem just a little too different to be accounted for by the development and aging of one person.The plot is outright bonkers, which follows a fine tradition of comics madness. In fact, a significant proportion of the plot revolves around characters struggling to convince each other of the truth, against their quite understandable skepticism. They make it work, though, due to returning director Bryan Singer's deft hand with character drama and returning writers Matthew Vaughn (who also directed First Class) and nerd queen Jane Goldman, who bring a real sense of playfulness that pokes gentle, affectionate fun at the plot, characters, setting and everything else that hoves into view.The title is dumb, the end credit scene is far too enigmatic for its own good, and there's no Stan Lee cameo, but these are all insignificant niggles compared to the fun, excitement and character-led drama, remarkably free from the inevitable encumberance of so many characters, so much comics history and so much money. Good job, guys.","

"s_campanale","22 May 2014","There were a lot of expectations resting on this movie's shoulders. A return from original director Bryan Singer, a resurrection of the original trilogy cast and a union of original trilogy and ""First Class"". Plus it features the beloved 'Sentinels' storyline and deals with time travel (always tricky) and the often used 'go back to the past to change the future' line, as well as heavy issues about war and peace and the power of choice over destiny etc. However, happily enough, this difficult and tricky balancing act has been pulled off with aplomb.The 'ravaged Earth' future (which is at odds with original trilogy but anyway..) is shamelessly derivative of 'The Terminator' and 'The Matrix' series, and they do not even try to hide it. Not so important given that it is just a bookend for the main story. Professor X and Magneto are now allies, facing an army of unstoppable anti-mutant robots called Sentinels which are like the offspring of the T1000 and Thor's Destroyer. Reduced to just a handful, it is decided to send Wolverine back to 1973 because he is the only one who can make the journey and also never ages (and because he is the main star of the series) His mission is to unite young Charles, a drug addicted wash out who is afraid of his mental powers, and young Lehnsherr, who is imprisoned beneath the Pentagon suspected of having assassinated Kennedy (?) Breaking him out with the aid of young Hank McCoy/Beast and Quicksilver, who can move at lightning speed, they have to stop Mystique, who is now a breakaway radical, from assassinating diminutive genius Bolivar Trask, inventor of the Sentinels, an act which will at once radicalise the human governments and provide Trask's team – headed by young Colonel Stryker – with her unique DNA that helps them create the T1000 like future Sentinels! After interrupting the first attempt at the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam War (where Trask is trying to sell his Sentinels to the Reds) they then track her down to Washington where President Nixon is unveiling the first generation robots. However Magneto is following his own radical agenda and crashes the party by dropping a Stadium around the White House and hijacking the robots. With the future on a literal knife edge it will be a series of individual personal choices that decides everything.There is a predictable but cute coda in a totally new future that sees a lot of dead characters alive again (guess who in particular?) and the events of the previous 5 contemporary timeline movies seemingly rubbed out to start anew.The film returns to big ideas and concepts, something that defined the original trilogy but largely disappeared from subsequent entries. In many ways it evokes ""Watchman"", right down to Nixon and a cold war milieu (here Vietnam) demonstrating human aggression and self destructiveness which a well meaning but misguided scientist hopes to end by uniting mankind against a common enemy (here mutants) It also returns to the core concept of X-Men, do you meet aggression and hostility with more aggression and hostility or do you reach out and change hearts and minds? Singer shows pros and cons of both sides but of course ends on a victory for peace and mutual tolerance. It is far more thought provoking and free thinking than the simplistic black and white agitprop of the overpraised ""Captain America the Winter Soldier"". The old free will/destiny dichotomy gets a fair airing as well with a message that even the smallest of gestures and choices can change not just our own lives but those of countless others. It is no coincidence that a classic Star Trek episode is playing in the background of a key moment!The film is not over abundant in action but then no previous X-Men ever was either. The ""Terminator"" future scenes are pretty much all in the trailer and seem done with little real care. There are some interesting set pieces in the 70's section, notably Quicksilver's bullet time rescue and a fight around the Paris peace talks that's caught on 8mm 'found footage'. The biggest battle comes at the end with Magneto's stadium lift and White House destruction, even if the resolution is ultimately intellectual rather than pyrotechnic.Acting wise, Jackman is again the star playing a more chilled out Wolverine this time in his 6th turn! Stewart and Mckellen are cameos more than anything else , leaving the real screen time to Mcavoy and Fassbender, who here play intermediate versions of the characters. McAvoy has most to do as a self doubting pathetic druggy wreck that gets a little tiresome quickly. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique gets another expanded role, driving the story along, but her performance is laconic and lacks passion. Nicholas Hoult is a nerdy Beast who can change at will while Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage plays unintended villain Trask well and never loads his character or reaches for camp. Other brief returnees from the original trilogy include Ellen Page, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore and Halle Berry, though like the big two they're just there for recognition value and do little.Perhaps a little action-light for some fans and a seeming step back from the reboot project, this film is nonetheless an engrossing and unusual left turn for the series that leaves us wanting to know more as the credits roll.","

"a_sad_cow","2 August 2021","This is one of my most rewatched movies. It's like they got everything right for once. Decades of character development all in one film, showing the stark contrast between the past and the future. Wolverine (of course). Xavier. Magneto. Raven. Beast. Trask. And so many brilliantly placed characters that could easily play a bigger part in other movies. Rogue. Quicksilver. Storm. Colossus. Bishop.Perhaps the most creative exploration of powers as well, to include a serum that gives Xavier an interesting choice that cuts to the heart of the mutant question. I'd love to watch this movie for the first time again. Even knowing all their powers, you're never quite sure whose powers will solve a particular problem. But all this power results in sentinels, which are so much more compelling than the sentinels from the 90s X-Men.The 70s was an interesting choice of era for this film. Not too long ago, but a time before Google and GPS, which makes characters work harder in a more deliberate fashion. I'm not convinced every subsequent X-Men film should be shot in this era, but it worked really well this time at least.It's been 7 years since this came out. When will we get more of this caliber?","

"skydragon-4","7 September 2014","Where do I begin with this movie. I watched this movie twice in two days back in May when it was first released. I had heard some good things about the movie but it far exceeded my expectations.First of all, I'm a huge X-Men fan. I've read the comics for years and most previous X-Men movies have taken a fair stab at trying to bring these Comic-Book superheroes to life on the big screen. Despite what others have said, X-Men 3: The Last Stand wasn't that bad of a movie in my opinion but I was really annoyed that they killed off Cyclops and Jean Grey. 'First Class' (The previous movie to this one) was a breath of fresh air.. A chance to have a new beginning if you will. It was a fantastic movie and I didn't think DoFP would be better. I was wrong. By miles.As you may have heard, Days of Future Past is a time travel movie. I was wondering when they'd bring the future into this series (Being such a big part of the comics) and I'm happy that they finally decided to do so. However, the 'time travel' aspect of the movie is done so damn well that everyone I was watching the movie with (Who don't understand this kind of stuff) understood it all for once. It's a simple story and everything is easy to follow.The movie is set in the near future and mutants are being hunted to near-extinction by powerful machines called ""Sentinels"". The few survivors realised that they can send the mind of a person back in time to influence events so as to change the future. This was initially done short-term to avoid Sentinels, but it was suggested that if someone's mind could be sent back far enough, they could stop the idea of Sentinels from ever having been conceived (The roots of the idea stem from a Scientist in the 70's). However, sending a mind back that far in time tears it apart, but there's one mutant who we know of who seems impervious to anything that you can throw at him - Wolverine. And thus, Wolverine's quest begins to change the past so that everyone can be saved in the future and we can all live in a better world.I have to admit, the movie was tense in a lot of places. There was humour, lots of action, brilliant CGI, amazing character development and a story that kept you hooked from beginning to end. You just weren't sure what would happen and the last third of the movie was amazing to watch. There were some parts that stood out and literally made my jaw drop such as watching Blink do her thing during the first few and last few minutes of the movie (The one that can shoot out these purple portals). I really wish they had put more of her in this movie; Quicksilver busting out Magneto from the Pentagon; Old Professor X talking with the younger one; Magneto lifting the stadium; Actually, I'll stop there..You can understand the story and you can relate to the characters. They all have their own reasons for doing what they do, from Professor Xavier taking the side of Humanity to Magneto thinking that a war is inevitable and that Mutants have to strike first. Then, there's Raven/Mystique who wants to avenge her fallen friends but is she willing to do so at the expense of the future?I can't wait for the Blu-Ray for this movie to be released so I can watch it again in High-Definition. When watching this movie, remember to watch the after-credits scene that sets up the next movie which will be released in 2016. All I'll say is - About damn time that that character made an appearance!10/10","

"sohansurag","15 September 2014","I remember the time when I was all jacked up when I saw the previews of X-Men. I was blown away when I saw the movie on VHS as well. Such an ensemble cast and Wolverine seemed to pack quite the punch. X2 Xmen United was better than I'd expected and the less said about X- Men The Last Stand, the better. Bryan Singer undoubtedly a skilled director as evident from The Usual Suspects and not to mention handling an ensemble cast like X-Men was no easy feat. But a look back at his recent flicks (Superman Returns, Jack The Giant Slayer), you are bound to set your hopes a bit low for X-Men Days of Future Past. Despite his fairly brilliant initial track record, I myself was skeptic about X-Men Days of Future Past especially when Matthew Vaughn's X-Men First Class had a set a bar at how well made an X-Men could be.Off to a very rocky start, Days of Future Past introduces to a dystopian 2023 run by Sentinels and the few remaining mutants fighting for their lives. I mentioned 'rocky' coz you are thrown into the thick of the action and despite the brilliant sequence, if you are not familiar with the X-Men lore you'd be wondering who these mutants are. You'll feel right at home when Charles Xavier, Eric Lensher Logan and Storm enters the scene. Logan is sent back to 1973 by Kitty Pride to prevent Trask Industries to ever build these Sentinels. Logan meets up with a younger Xavier, Hank, Eric and Raven and sets about to save the world once again. What ensures is a good two plus hours of entertainment.Time Travel is used as a plot device and a lot could go wrong if there ain't much thought put into it. Thanks to Bryan Singer the comic series of the same name, time travel n Days of Future Past works just fine. It fills in most of the conflicts caused in the franchise's timeline but then again by the end of Days Of Future Past, the original X-Men trilogy supposedly never happens (If I am correct). There are some nifty sequences that'll make you go Whoa. The Magneto Prison break sequence in particular, left me in awe, thanks to Quicksilver. This rendition of Quicksilver was so good and leaves me wondering if this version would come on top if it had to go head to head with the upcoming Joss Whedon version from The Avengers Age of Ultron. I guess you cant have too much of a good thing as Quicksilver is sent home just after the said sequence.Unlike the spinoffs the X-Men series had always been about the Mutant-Human war and its the same here. There is a ton of other story arcs that had loads more potential but it sticks to the same formulaic arc. Another qualm were the mere glimpses of mutants like Bishop, Wink, Colossus and even Storm and used as just baits. While the mutants showed off some cool combat, these are pretty relevant characters from the X-Men series and to make them just cannon fodder, not cool! X- Men Days Of Future past delivers but I felt it doesn't have that charm or the heart X-Men First Class had. And if ranked X-Men Days of Future Past might be a notch below X2 X-Men United and First Class. There is a ton of fan service here and it is also advised to watch the past X- Men movies to get the complete gist of Days of Future Past.Bryan Singer once again proves that he's good with an ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Ellen Page all plays noteworthy roles in Days of Future Past. If this isn't star studded, I don't know what is. In almost all the previous X-Men movies Hugh Jackman usually steals the show, and he does most of the heavy lifting here as well but a bit of the limelight is also shared or rather snatched by James McAvoy playing the younger Xavier. McAvoy displays a remarkable performance and brings in layers of emotions to the man in the wheel chair. Michael Fassbender also shines throughout with his cold steel looks and grey shades. Jennifer Lawrence excels in being Mystique as well as sexy and becomes one of the most indispensable characters in the narrative. Boliver Trask wasn't even a dwarf in the original X- Men lore and yet Peter Dinklage nails it, his acting prowess was all that was needed and not his height.The visuals were fairly impressive, but I did notice some itsy bitsy flaws here and there. I loved the way the footages from 1973 had a kind of Eastman color shade to it. The Future Sentinels were impressively rendered and felt daunting indeed. The X-Men theme makes a comeback as well, Thanks to John Ottman. While it wouldn't even come close to Henry Jackman's awe inspiring original score from X-Men First Class, Ottman's score still brought forth a sense of nostalgia.X-Men Days of Future Past is a great comeback for Bryan Singer and some of the faith in him has been restored. It doesn't break any grounds and despite its gaping plot holes and flaws, X-Men Days of Future Past makes for a good entertaining flick. Go watch it!PS: As its tradition, do wait for the credit roll to get over for some awesome Post Credit Sequence paving way to the next in series: X-Men Apocalypse.","

"ersinkdotcom","10 October 2014","When it was announced that Bryan Singer was returning to the Director's Chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" fanboys and girls everywhere squealed in excitement. Finally, the series was going back into the hands of the man who helped start the whole film franchise. I, on the other hand, groaned and wondered why ""First Class"" helmsman Matthew Vaughn couldn't return to push the story further. It was my favorite entry in the series and took the bad taste out of my mouth created by the mess referred to as ""The Last Stand.""In the distant future, robots known as Sentinels have all but wiped out both mutants and humans. Wolverine is sent by the X-Men to prevent an event which will send history down this path to destruction. First he has to find a way to unite Professor X and Magneto in a search for the harbinger of doom - Mystique.My worries over Singer's return to steer the franchise were all realized after the first hour or so of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" The first portion of the film moves ahead and sets the viewer up for a powerful and epic thrill ride. Unfortunately, like most of the director's movies, it starts to meander and get tedious right after the halfway mark. The action and excitement gets bogged down in a lot of dramatic narrative which feels as if it was injected into the script to make the movie more analytical than it really needed to be.One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the way the massive amount of cast members and the parts they played in the story were handled. I was concerned when it was announced that the original and new actors who portrayed their respective characters were going to be jammed into one movie. How in the world were filmmakers going to keep the movie from becoming overcrowded and derailing? Director Singer and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg handled the whole affair quite well. Instead of trying to cram as much of a pleasurable thing down our throats as they could, they worked towards the greater good of the whole. They didn't play favorites and shove certain popular actors into scenes just to give them more face time.""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is rated PG-13for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity, and language. I've seen Hugh Jackman's butt enough now. Does it really have to be showcased in every one of these films?Although I did enjoy ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" to a certain degree, I felt myself getting lethargic as it moved along towards its inevitable climax. By no means is it a bad movie, but I think it could've been better under Matthew Vaughn's direction. I do give it props for fully embracing its science fiction roots.","

"chaos-rampant","9 September 2014","God, another one of these superhero juggernauts. Perhaps other viewers find each one so much different than all the other Marvel clones, I don't know. They're all a big blur of samey rush to me. I don't find real invention going on in any of them, any freshness in the mythos, any actual difference (which is touted as the big theme here). You'll know this is just tired by the whole apocalyptic / time-travel storyline. So another attempt to construct fate; there's something wrong about humanity at large and where we're headed as a race, in the film this culminates (in the beginning) with humanity defeated at the hands of our own desire to root out difference, and the effort to reconstruct the past, we land back in Nixon's America where things apparently started going wrong, to replay it so that we can be inspired by the message that doom is not inevitable and hope can alter courses. No, the only thing worth seeing for me is what new contraptions these Hollywood teams devise each time to propel the camera. It gets a bit tiresome having to throw out heaps of story to focus on cinematic flows which become merely mechanic without it (story), meaningless, such is the case here.In X-Men, each character is an opportunity to ripple in an unusual way. Someone will erupt in flames or change shapes, okay. The two arch rivals can leverage the most awesome forces. For the bad guy this is confined to matter, the ability to command the material fabric, to undo and rearrange - usually this is an opportunity for awesome scenery, last time a submarine was lifted out of the sea, here a whole stadium is airborne. It's daft destruction, rather suitably as will without empathy.More interesting is the good professor who can enter mind, command vision. This should be the most tantalizing opportunity for scenery of another kind, which also chimes with a recurrent interest of mine; how can we envision a mental space? A girl with similar mental powers propels the journey back in time, through her we have the first glimpse of this, the camera enters inside an eye to swim in a gaseous space of consciousness. Near the end, the professor searches in a similar constellation of minds.And however much they manage to perfect the material physics, there's a nifty scene where time is slowed that almost exists in the story as comedic demo-reel of what can be achieved with all the big studio tools at hand, so much more crude seems the inner dimension.","

"pcrprimer","25 May 2014","After X-men First Class, the X-men franchise was given a breath of fresh air. This movie continues the same level of of quality story telling and great characters. The beginning of the movie and future scenes felt very similar to the bleak future portrayed in Terminator, after judgement day. The streets are littered with bones, the skies are dark, and sentinel carrying ships are tracking down the X-men. The main cast members are all back, and once again McAvoy, Fassbender, their older counter-parts, and everyone else are totally in character. Although Jennifer Lawerence wasn't given much to work with in the first one, she definitely holds her own with some great talent. I feel that the last X-men had Fassbender steal the show, in this one, McAvoy steals the show with his portrayal of a broken Professor X. I also liked how the time travel technique was different from most other movies. Some really cool mutant powers were introduced, such as Blink with her portals and Quicksilver with his superspeed.SPOILERS BELOW (mini-criticism)The after-credits scene seemed very unpolished, and almost had video- game level graphics for the special effects. I'd prefer that directors simply withhold these kinds of teases, when clearly they don't have the time or resources for the correct effect. A similar problem existed for Thor 2, which had a very cartoonish after-credits scene that may be corrected in Guardians of Galaxy.","

"karan-virgo92","13 September 2014","X-men Days of Future Past redefines the genre of smart superhero movie. The movie delves into the psychological depth of the characters that we have admired for decades. It is not just about a war between humans and mutants in this movie. It is more about correcting one's path and believing that by changing your decisions, one can have a better life to live.All the characters face a dilemma of what they must do and what they should do. While Wolverine has a choice whether he should go in past to fix things, young Charles Xavier has a choice to make between pain or power. Mystique faces a choice between exacting revenge on those who hurt or forgive while Magneto faces a choice between following his path or following Charles's wishes. Bolivar Trask clearly thinks of his own dwarfism as a bad form of mutancy and he wishes the world to be rid of the phenomenon. Smart choice to pick Peter Dinkalge for the role who clearly nails it. His own sentinel program is determined by his desire for ""true peace"" but it sounds hollow in the face of the destruction that the sentinel causes 50 years later.This is definitely a smart movie and not just a popcorn flick. Evan Peters is too good as Magneto's illegitimate son Pietro Maximoff. The direction by Bryan Singer is top notch. Clever shifting of scenes in the final segment between past and the future. The momentum and the pace of both the stories is well maintained.I go for a 10 rating for this Marvel venture. Keep it coming.P.S.- Don't miss out on the Post Credit scene.","

"Laakbaar","22 May 2014","This is an excellent movie. (Can you tell that I'm sort of surprised?) The science-fiction story, the writing, the pacing, the acting, the franchise exploitation and the CGI effects all come together really well in this latest X-Men film.It helps that three of the finest and most versatile actors on the planet are at the heart of the movie.Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) has done what is necessary to bring an intense physicality and masculine presence to his demanding superhero role. I liked that he was not at the centre of things all the time, although Wolverine was a key player, as in all X-Men movies.James McAvoy (the young Charles Xavier) owns his role and conveys the required emotion so movingly. Such a superb actor. What a stroke of genius it was getting him to play the younger version of Patrick Stewart. For me, he was the emotional heart of the film.The appearance of Michael Fassbender (the young Magneto) on the screen was like a punch to the stomach. Here this versatile actor plays an intense, driven, icy character, and he absolutely nails it. One of the best scenes was one where Magneto confronted the presidential entourage in front of the world's cameras. Mutantus terribilis.The other actors also rose to the challenge. Jennifer Lawrence, in particular. Wow, Raven/Mystique is one female mutant not to mess with. And then, on top of all that, we also had Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. This struck me as an intelligent and often moving film, despite the endless fight scenes, superhero powers and city-destruction scenes that you see in every movie nowadays. There were a few nuances and profound messages in this film, for those who were looking for them. And the dialogue never seemed off. There were also a few truly hilarious scenes (I'm thinking now of Quicksilver). The writing is good, very good.I was worried because I couldn't quite follow the plot at the start. But it soon sorted itself out. I also thought it was a little anachronistic to have such technology in 1973. But hey it's science fiction, and it didn't ruin the movie for me. Loved the 1973 setting, by the way.Kudos to Bryan Singer, the writers and actors for pulling this off. This is surely the best X-Men movie made so far. It's worth about 8.5. What the heck, I'll give it a 9. Go see it!","

Now we come to the future or should I say the past or should I say the future. Matthew Vaughn did a great job with First Class, but Bryan Singer – OMG OMG this movie has given us more intel than we thought we would ever have.The past has come into the future, or so to speak to stop an unthinkable demise. I don't want to reveal too, too much for those that have not seen this movie, but I will say thisPatrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry – you brought the past into the future – you guys are the epitome of great acting. To the newbies – James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law), Nicholas Hoult, and a slew of new mutants – everything was just superb in every single way.The movie defines what we should be in our future, not define us what we were once in the past. Let's not look to the past, but to the future. Thank you Bryan Singer for reminding us that it's not about the past, but the future.","

The performance are great, it's fun and there are great character interactions. There is some great action and the plot is great. I liked Mystique in this much more then in the previous film. The villain is ok but doesn't have much motivation to be doing what he is doing. Overall a fantastic movie in my opinion.9.4/10","

"yourfavoritecritic","27 December 2021","X-Men: Days of Future Pasts finds mutants in their greatest plight yet, as in 2023 A. I. robots known as Sentinels are sent to eradicate them. With the help of Kitty Pryde, Wolverine volunteers himself to be sent back in time to 1973 where he must work with a young Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr and Hank McCoy to alter public opinion about mutants thus stopping the creation of the dreaded Sentinels. With Bryan Singer returning to direct, alongside all cast members back to reprise their roles past and present, Days of Future is an ambitious X-Men story to tell but was a hit for both audiences and critics back in 2014.The crux of this tale relies on time travel and while that can be an aspect that is hard to nail given the many story details that are required to be thought about, it's something that can lead to many plot holes and while Days of Future isn't perfect it mostly works. It was fun seeing the present Wolverine interact with the very young Professor X and Magneto, and seeing the return of the First Class cast was great. James and McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are standouts yet again, each delivering equally great performances, McAvoy portrays a very different Charles Xavier than we have ever seen before. He is a cynical man that has lost all hope for a balance between Mutant-Human relations and would rather subdue his powers with an experimental drug than use his brain for good. It was an interesting depiction of the character that led itself to some wonderful story moments. While Erik Lehnsherr's motives sort of remain the same, Michael Fassbender does an excellent job with it, he is both menacing and someone you root for to do the right thing. All the other actors and actresses do a fantastic job as well, no one felt out of place, even with all the returning characters from the previous X-Men trilogy.Another standout of Days of Future Past is the CGI, a lot of the effects are seamless and with a movie so reliant on them, nothing ever felt out of place and it feels like a film that will hold up for years to come. It was also really nice to see Beast done properly again, gone is the computer-generated mouth in place for a more traditional look that uses practical rather special effects and it really pays off. The movie also features a perfect sense of scale, everything feels grand with massive stakes on the line and the story went places, particularly near the end, where I wasn't sure exactly what was going to happen. It was refreshing to watch a superhero film and not be able to predict the whole thing.While there are a lot of positives to X-Men: Days of Future Past I found the runtime to hurt the film at points. I found myself checking the time more often than I should and I wasn't always engaged with what was going on. It was nowhere near as consistently fun or entertaining as X-Men: First Class, perhaps with further rewatches I may feel differently, but where I stand right now, it is certainly a good X-Men movie but not my favourite in the franchise.Nonetheless, Days of Future is an excellent superhero movie that is ambitious in its plot which pays off. It is certainly a film I can recommend however if you're brand new to the series I would suggest catching up on the previous movies just to get a good understanding of all the characters featured here. Even though I may not be head over heels for the film, I certainly respect the craft that went into it and I can say that it is one of the better movies in the hero genre, and with all that being said I am giving X-Men: Days of Future Past a 7.5/10.","

They're too many already, and they don't even connect to each other. What in the world does 'Days of Future Past' mean? Is that like 'Back to the Future' articulated so clumsily that it makes your head spin? And if these freaks had a time machine all along, why did it take them so long to turn it on? It doesn't even matter, because I'm just exhausted by the idea of humans and mutants waring up to wipe each other out. Have the damned war already. Isn't it like 20 years now that we've been put on the edge of our seats over this war that's coming? My sensitivities have been callused over, I don't care about mutants anymore. Wipe 'em all out or put them on reservations already. They're a nuisance, and I'm sick of them.","

"ryanskywalker-87402","2 March 2017","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins solidly if unremarkably. New and well-known characters are introduced. A legendary enemy is revealed. A plot linking present with past is established. This is engaging stuff, and the film quickly sets itself up as an engrossing adventure with a serious tone and high stakes. It all makes for something entertaining but not special.Something happens along the way, however, and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins to resonate stronger and appeal more deeply. In a scene where the Charles Xavier of the past is confronted by his future self, the film ceases to be a run-of-the-mill superhero adventure. It becomes the story of a man with the power to impact the world. It becomes an observation of his journey and his impact on the characters and world around him, past, present, and future. It becomes the human story of understanding fear and embracing hope.Bryan Singer's spectacular ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is more than a sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"" or a prequel to ""X-Men."" It is a wrap-around event that courses through and changes the world of the previous films. It is a grand piece of entertainment that respects what has already been established in the franchise's universe and opens up a dynamic future. Pulsing with memorable and exciting set- pieces, the film is a solid action outing but, more importantly, has the soul of a character piece. It observe the journeys, the developments, the shifts, and the fulfillment of its colorful, comic book characters.The story is involving, but the story's characters are its highlight. They generate humor, warmth, anger, and excitement. Their arcs are tragic, epic, and triumphant. Their eyes are haunted and hopeful. They are the comic book gods of a new Olympus, but they are as human as their audience.Bryan Singer is blessed with a cast that is able to at once communicate not only the fantasy, mutant elements of their characters' bodies and brains but also the disparate humanity punctuating their actions. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen serve as godfathers and guardians of their younger charges. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender are both brilliant and burdened. They are ideally cast as broken men on separate paths.Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult both capture the vitality and impetuous juvenility of youth. They have suffered loss that colors their arcs, and it shows in their words and reactions. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, is an underutilized revelation with spirit and humor.Anchoring all of this is Hugh Jackman. Here, he is asked to stay in the background, but his charisma and knowing ferocity hold the rest of the cast, and the film, together. Jackman's Wolverine is now a leader and a less an antihero. His mantle of teacher, like that of Xavier's in the previous films, suits him well.Singer turns in a film composed of exhilarating action beats and satisfying character drama captured with a subtle visual style. His 1970s are subtly swinging and sepia-toned. They are as vibrant as the cinematic world makes them out to be. The future is dark and cold. It is drained of color in crisp contrast to the 1970s.Singer's tendency to shoot his cast in closeup accentuates the importance of character over spectacle. It is a refreshing change of pace for this type of film. Cinematography, editing, and score all complement each other and sell the film's overall quality.All of this results in one of the most accomplished and, in short, best superhero films ever made. The drama, the humor, the action are all sharp and well-measured. The production is outstanding with its blend of artful comic book flash and focus.Of all these well-appointed elements, what makes ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" so excellent are its themes and emotional center. The film is more than a superhero romp. It is a film about struggle: not just the struggle against larger-than-life enemies, but the personal struggle with what human beings are and what they are meant to be. It is about struggle against the march of time and memory. Most importantly, it is about the triumph of hope over fear and over that struggle. This beating thematic heart of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the reason the film succeeds at such high levels. It is the grandly important center of a fantastic film.","

And how can you not love the easter eggs everywhere in these films. Wonderful hat-tips to the comics.But that cast....this series set the bar wonderfully high for subsequent Marvel movies.

"hannahroseimagery","28 December 2021","This movie starts on a really overused premise. Logan goes back in time to save the future. Where have I heard that concept before? Oh wait, everywhere! But, this movie adds the signature X-men bleakness to the concept, and that, combined with some really intelligent storytelling and acting (especially the acting), somehow not only saves the movie, but makes it really poignant and memorable as well. I saw this one before First Class (whoops!), so I'm writing this review as my first introduction to the younger Erik, Charles, Hank, and Raven.Raven is a young woman teetering on the edge of destruction, but stubborn and driven, she refuses to see it. Erik is quite frankly still Erik, a self-righteous, sadistic maniac. Hank is uncertain, loyal to a man who is slowly self-destructing. Charles is the real star here, as the actor shows him unraveling in devastation and self pity. There is a lot of pain, a lot of hurt, and a lot of potential among these younger iterations.Into this Logan comes, and has to try to get them all to work together. Perhaps this movie works so well because it takes the threads of regret, sadness, pain, hopelessness, and lost opportunities, and weaves a tapestry of light through darkness, of hope through bleakness. It is a story of salvation (from a dark path) for some, of return to the good path for others.While much of the movie is extraordinary, the blend of past and future into one gut-wrenching sequence near the end might be my favorite part. If you liked X1-3, this one is as good if not much better. This and X1 are actually my favorites. But be ready to 😢","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","26 May 2014","Given that the future is a dystopian wasteland, because of the murder of a prominent figure in 1973, Wolverine(Jackman, by this point inhabiting the part) has to go back to keep it from happening. Why him? To drive up audience interest. He'll stand around and look pretty. Beast will have a little more to do. But this is actually about the trinity of Xavier(McAvoy, and giving us a compelling portrayal, one who has lost hope this is his film, and the scene between him and Stewart is amazing), Magneto(Fassbender, dignified) and Mystique(Lawrence, showing us her immense range and she is the assassin that has to be stopped). This is where the laser-sharp focus comes from: All three are fiercely determined, bridge the gap between young and old(First Class, take notes), conflicted in what they feel they have to do, and using different approaches to solving the same problem: how will mutants be safe among humans who hate them and fear them? Especially given that this is a pivotal pointSinger is back, with a vengeance. Any frustration with him for his absence and the mess the series fell into after he left is almost instantly forgiven. He seamlessly fixes the plentiful problems, turning what once looked like insurmountable obstacles to retcon into stepping stones to new, gripping conflicts. This is a drama more than an action movie, with the latter derived organically from the former and not missed. It is never boring, and understands that the love of this half a century old franchise is not so much what these people can do, but who they are, and how they relate to one another. Everyone's powers are used well, and they aren't particularly written out, which was one of the bigger problems with the otherwise excellent first two pictures. The pacing is spot-on, giving us breathing room after emotions are driven through the roof, humor taking the sting out of the dark material, and at no point does it lose our interest or play its cards wrong. Every character is a human being, reacting based on their viewpoint, to the very real problem here. The xenophobia is dealt with well.Almost everything here is amazing. The 2023 bits do tend to be a display case for fan-service(and yes, for what that is, it is squee-inducing), with everyone present not mentioned in the first paragraph of this existing there only to use the considerable strength of their abilities(no arc, barely any personality) and fairly inconsequential. It really doesn't help that the first fun portion of it literally turns out to be a fake-out. We don't return to it much, and it does give us something incredible, but it is overall the one weak point. And it's not that much of one. This sets a new standard for these, and, frankly, gives us something to rival the Marvel Studios outings, now that Nolan is no longer helming Batman. The FX are excellent. The stakes are set up immensely well right off the bat, with the large, humanoid robots known as Sentinels clearly an insurmountable threat that has to be stopped before it starts.There is some deeply disturbing, brutal and violent(if not bloody) content in this, pushing to the edge of what PG-13 can get away with. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine liking it. 9/10","

To bring back the original cast, which was uniformly terrible aside from Jackman, Stewart and McKellan?

"TheMovieSnob247","25 May 2014","We begin in a very bleak future. Mutants are fighting a war they cannot win as next generation sentinels have pushed them to the verge of extinction. The last remaining mutant survivors converge on a single location and hold out for one last stand. Magneto and Professor X have identified a singular event in the past that was the catalyst for their current predicament. If they can prevent this from occurring, they can save not only themselves, but most of humanity. The strain of travelling back in the past on the subconscious is significant however and given his regenerative mutant powers, only Wolverine can survive the journey. Once back in time, Wolverine must race against time to convince the younger Magneto and Professor X to put aside their differences and unite in order to change the course of the future before the sentinels discover their future holdout and wipe them out. Days of Future Past is a fantastic film. Most summer movies have tonnes of action and special effects, but they mostly fail to cast good, convincing actors, create sufficient drama or develop the story necessary to make the action scenes resonate and be meaningful (Godzilla anyone?). This film excels in this regard. Time is taken to develop the story and the inner conflict of Professor X, Mystique and Magneto as they struggle with overcoming personal fear, rejection, past differences and whether or not they can trust not only themselves, but also the humans. The slight downside of this is the film is a little slow in the middle, but this is pivotal to the effectiveness of the last act. Having said that, at no point does the film drag on and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Evan Peters (Quick Silver) provide plenty of humour to keep what is mostly a dark narrative light and enjoyable. Admittedly, as in all time travel movies, not everything totally adds up when you think through all the permutations of how this affects the previous films, events and characters in the Marvel universe. For the most part the story isn't convoluted and is entertaining throughout. The film has excellent casting, from top to bottom and I would say this is the best cast Marvel film to date. There are no unnecessary characters or weak performances; every character plays a key role in the story and is convincing. Hugh Jackman continues to be excellent as Wolverine (sadly, they still can't seem to make a great movie where he is the headline). Michael Fassbender (Magneto) and James McAvoy (Professor Xavier) once again provide solid performances and along with Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) are the emotional centre of the film and elevate it above the usual summer fair. Peter Dinklage (Dr. Trask) isn't given much to work with, but he delivers a fairly serviceable performance. I also really appreciated that Bryan Singer provided some of the lessor known X-Men such as Bishop and Blink with meaningful screen time. All in all, this is as good as you can get for such a large, ensemble cast; full marks across the board. The highlight of the film for me though was the future sentinels; they were fantastic! The special effects for these are incredible and they are the catalyst for some amazing battles in the future story arc. While I was a little disappointed in the interpretation of sentinels of the past (as they weren't quite how I remembered them from the Saturday morning FOX cartoon of my childhood), the design and action sequences with them more than made up for it as they were so well done (and that is an understatement!). Very impressive special effects overall and plenty of action to keep even the most ardent fan boy satisfied. This has to be seen in a higher end theatre such as IMAX or UltraAVX.The film brings together a strong balance of action, good story telling and meaningful performances that lead to an emotionally jarring conclusion as the X-Men fight to survive in both the past and future. As the story lines converge it was impossible not only to be on the edge of my seat as it came to a thrilling conclusion, but also to be invested in their struggle. It was reminiscent of the last act of The Dark Knight, it was that good. This is the perfect summer movie and not to be missed by Marvel or action fans. Not only does it challenge as the best Marvel film yet, it's also the best film of 2014 to date.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob","

"The-Sarkologist","31 May 2014","I am not really sure if they can successfully continue the X-men franchise after this movie because, in a way, it seems to tie up all of the loose strands that have come out of the other films. Also, ignoring the fact that there are still some inconsistencies with some of the other films (which I have outlined elsewhere I believe) Days of Future Past also seems to bring the two X-men Origin films into connection with the later X-men films (which has now gone substantially beyond that of a trilogy considering the second Wolverine movie is actually set after The Last Stand).Days of Future Past started of very clunkyly, and somewhat annoying, because, well, I didn't particularly like the sentinels, and also it seemed as if they were trying to pack way to much into the opening sequence in the film (namely that war had broken out between the mutants and the normals, and the mutants were on the losing side). However, once they had managed to send Wolverine back in time the film itself began to pick up again.The film itself has a rather strange chronology, and that is that in one sense it is set a number of years after The Last Stand, but it is also set fifteen years after First Class, which means in part it is also an Origins movie (though not quite, though the same actors that are used in Origins are used in this film as well). The catch is that Wolverine's back story seems to be incredibly blurred in a way because according to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, around this time (and the time of First Class) Wolverine was hanging around with his brother Sabretooth, however Origins and this film seem to suggest otherwise (though the ending does sort of line up with the first Wolverine movie, but I won't say too much about that).Another thing about this film, which is similar to The Last Stand, was that they managed to make Magneto appear to be much, much more than a superhero and almost godlike. Okay, he has power over metal but it seems that his power is so phenomenal that he is able to lift up bridges and baseball stadiums, and in a way it sort of did nothing to suspend my disbelief. Also some of these scenes seemed to simply be done to show off the special effects and really had little to do with the plot anyway (sort of a wow factor). As for the story, well it seems as if this story is a popular one from the X-men comic, namely that the war is going badly for the mutants so they send Wolverine back into the past to attempt to prevent the war from ever beginning. Apparently there was a story arc from one of the comics, and there was also a cartoon series using the same premise (though it seemed that it was Professor X who was trapped in the future as opposed to him sending Wolverine back into the past).","

"sparksnkent","30 May 2014","Let me first say I'm not a comic book fan, so I can't approach my review from that direction. But I did like the X Men movies (except for First Class), mostly because I loved the Wolverine. My favorite was The Wolverine, which I considered to be an excellent character study that made mutants feel believable in the real world- something which the X Men films lacked with their funny suits and spaceships. This movie, however, disappointed me greatly. I left the theater in a state of uncertainty and confusion, and with time to think about it, I realized why I didn't like it.First, Wolverine was a plot device and as a result seemed very out of character here. He barely did anything Wolvy would really do in most situations. There was no fight scene, no memorable lines- and assaulting men with a cast iron skillet? Really? His emotions were short changed at the end upon seeing Jean gray alive- but then all the characters emotional reactions seemed to resolve themselves at a rapid rate, so much so that their internal struggles felt unreal and unsympathetic.The beginning of the movie was a traditional X Men opening, which excited me at first. But I couldn't feel anything for some of the mutants fighting for their lives like Blink and Sunspot and Bishop, when I didn't even know who they were personally- character development is not simply a display of power. The movie went south once Trask was introduced as experimenting on mutants. Wasn't that done before? And Stryker's reasons for experimentation were much more compelling. There was material reused from previous X Men films. I couldn't believe the scene with Mystique in Trask's office looking through files with a secretary coming up the stairs. This was along the same lines as the scene in X2 when she finds the files on cerebro- then quickly shape shifts before being discovered. However, the scene in X2 was much more suspenseful. And Magneto lifts a sports stadium and drops in around the White House. Not sure what that was for but a big CGI display. And folks railed against the Golden Gate Bridge destruction in the Last Stand, but at least that was to get to the island on the other side. And the sentinels- they looked liked big Iron Men...There is so much more I could address- like the use of Mystique's blood- that did not make sense. The acting was terrible among the younger cast, but J Lawrence took the cake. Every time she said a line it was painful- I thought the original Mystique was so much better. James McAvoy was OK, but every time Xavier had a conflict, he just as quickly recovered so the story could continue on. The drama oftentimes felt rushed.The director couldn't seem to settle on where to put the camera on the action scenes, which made the stories execution and terrible script seem worse. The best part of the movie was Wolvy,s fight with Beast, and a couple of ideas that could have been so awesome- like the older Magneto reaching out to Charles in the future setting near the end. Once again, the emotions were rushed and improperly shot. It felt as if the entire film was over shot and then sloppily edited. The script was awful and there were no memorable lines.The screenwriter did say the script was intended as a goodbye to the original cast. But what an awful way to say goodbye to all of them- especially Wolvy, who looked like a sissy in this film. The teen film seems to reign in theaters today. The younger you are, the better. It used to be that middle aged stars could carry films for years- think Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood. But now being in one's forties is just to old, so you have to be recast and written out. The only reason I went to see this movie was Wolvy and the original cast. It's sad to see X Men so mistreated and wiped aside for a younger cast that just can't deliver the emotions or the setting half as good.","

"John K.-2","24 May 2014","The strength of X-Men films has always been to give a large number of characters a decent bit of the story, and to allow viewers to imagine what it would be like to have that particular power. The moral of X-Men films has always been the same: people who are genetically different have to learn to live in peace. This film is absolutely solid on both of these aspects, along with occasional self-referential humour. However, it doesn't bring anything outstanding beyond the above. It's set partly in the 1970s, and goes out of its way to include odd stuff from the seventies (let's face it, there was plenty); it charts more of the characters' personal development; it performs the necessary reboot that major franchises seem to require these days; and it has plenty of high-tech special effects. All perfectly competent (apart from one 'revelation' concerning a well-known three-letter acronym that nearly made me laugh out loud), and yet I walked away feeling I'd seen most of it before, in one form or another.See it of you're a fan of the franchise and want to watch the story progress. If you haven't seen any X-Men films before, it's a good night out but you'd be better to watch some of the others first.","

"Jackbv123","6 August 2017","Plenty of action to go with this non-stop story. Most of it is not predictable. Things seem to go from bad to worse for the future of mutants.We are tempted to focus on James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, not to mention Hugh Jackman, but despite being fourth in the credits the center of the story is Jennifer Lawrence. She plays the pivot pin of the entire situation. Raven is a product of her past and Lawrence does a great job of showing her struggle to overcome it. Why is Lawrence fourth in the credits? I recently saw Logan and can't help but make comparisons. Both have action and destruction right and left, but this movie manages to do it without the gore and mutilation. Logan has little substance in the plot, but this movie delivers an engaging plot. In this movie we have good acting from most if not all of the majors, while in Logan, all the performances were mailed in. The reason I compare the two is because Logan has a IMDb rating of 8.2 and this one, as I write, an 8.0. This movie is so much better, in all aspects.","

"rick-j-walsh","23 May 2014","X-Men: Days ... is a dazzlingly convoluted popcorn movie extravaganza that brings back memories of the surprising summertime joy of discovering Jaws. Bryan Singer's return to the series results in his best film since The Usual Suspects and one of the best comic book-inspired films this side of The Dark Knight. Using intricate CGI and arresting visuals, time-honored sci-fi plot twists swirling around time travel, and a sense of humor, Singer has crafted a perfect cinematic treat. The acting of the entire cast is perfect. However, Evan Peters in his all too short appearance as Quicksilver, steals the movie. Let's hope he resurfaces in days of future future. Lot's of fun!","

"stevendbeard","23 May 2014","I saw ""X-Men:Days of Future Past"", starring Hugh Jackman-Real Steel, Swordfish; James McAvoy-Wanted, Band of Brothers_t.v., Michael Fassbender-The Counselor, Jonah Hex; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Winter's Bone and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_t.v., Death at a Funeral.This is based on a comic book storyline from the X-Men comic books from somewhere around 1981. It's directed by Bryan Singer-he directed the first two X-Men movies-and I think this film is the best one in the series. It combines both the older and the newer characters by using time travel. The story starts off in the not too distant future, where Sentinels- mutant hunting robots-are eliminating any and all mutants wherever they can find them. The surviving X-Men come up with a plan to send Hugh-Wolverine-into the past, to prevent the building of the Sentinels. It seems that Hugh is the only X-Man that could survive the trip, what with his unique healing factor. Peter-Bolivar Trask-creates the mutant hunting robots in 1973 and Jennifer-Mystique- assassinates him, which causes the speedy production of the Sentinels. Hugh has to jump back in time, get the younger versions of James-Charles Xavier-and Michael-Magneto-to help him find Jennifer and then stop her, before the Sentinels kill the last mutants in the bleak future. There are several new mutants to keep an eye on; Warpath, Blink and Quicksilver are a few and Quicksilver is a real scene stealer. There is also a scene after the end credits which sets up the next X-Men movie; it shows a brief glimpse of the next villain and his name starts with an ""A"". It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"slrkeytekt-536","3 July 2014","reading a few reviews from newspapers and the internet i never understood how a superhero movie with a time travel theme can be better than fiction movies like 'star trek'(2009) or 'back to the future'(1985). i went in for a 3d movie and was surprised to watch half the movie without the 3d glasses. 3d technology at its worst can be witnessed in this movie(but the specs say this movie was shot on real 3d cameras (highly debatable). SPOILERS AHEAD: 1. the future is dark (meaning there is no sunlight in the future... that is dumb by all standards) 2. wolverine has gray hair though others tell him he does not age at all. 3. freezing superheated metal makes the metal shatter (dumb iceman) 4. sentinels are the biggest joke I've seen in superhero movie since superman lifting kryptonite island in superman returns. 5. Hugh Jackman starred in the movie to portray a shirtless man who tells Charles to use his mind to speak to future Charles(doesn't do a thing in the whole movie). 6. blink dies the same way twice... as if she matters. 7. magneto was broken from prison to be sent back to prison. 8. Jennifer Lawrence was CGIfied for every scene except the talking ones(completely unnecessary) 9. kitty pryde bled for two days in the future and didn't die (why does Bryan singer make movies any more) 10. old sentinels were hacked by metal bars and obey magneto (again. why does Bryan singer make movies anymore) 11. hank's mutation suppression serum could have been mass produced in the dark times to avoid sentinel attacks.MATHEW VAUGHN needs great respect to have revived the xmen franchise but days of future past was a publicity stunt to just breach the box office barriers garnering all fans of Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Patrick Stewart, Ian mckellen, Michael fassbender, Ellen page, James mcavoy and halle berry.the one star in this review is given to the only star in this movie who matters (EVAN PETERS).... his engaging 7 minute screen time is the only thing that matters in the movie.","

"jamesengh","6 February 2015","They should stop calling these movies X-men. It should just be called Wolverine. I hate what they have done to x-men. Bishop is in the movie for maybe 5 min and the story is about going back in time. If your the type of person that has no knowledge of the X-men universe and just want to have a good time watching a movie you may have enjoyed it, but you were robbed. You were robbed of what the X-men really are and that is complex characters with richer struggles and woe. They have failed to illustrate all the love triangles and created ones that simply don't exist. I just don't know what to say anymore. I see this movie has a good rating. I don't think i can trust the rating system here any longer.","

"thedukeofmovietown","31 October 2016","he long awaited 7th X film that merges the universes of The Wolverine, X-Men and X-Men First Class is finally here! If you know anything about the X-Men movie franchise you know it's been a hit or miss series and in my opinion there have been more misses than hits and even then, the hits aren't misstep free. Now, any other studio would have just hit the reset button, so to speak, and rebooted the franchise with whatever pieces they wanted going forward. However, hats off to the writing team of Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn who instead undertook the truly herculean feat of not only telling the classic Days of Future Past story from the X-Men comics, but also writing a story that effectively rights all the wrongs done over the past 14 years of spotty movie making. Days of Future Past is quite possibly the best X-Men movie yet! The story is complex but in a nutshell, Wolverine is sent back in time to stop a series of events that start a catastrophic war in the future. Again, it is complex but the story is well put together and the cast is bursting at the seams with dozens and dozens of memorable X-Men and even more Easter eggs for the truly savvy fan. But you don't have to be a super fan in order to get enjoyment out of this movie. I'll admit I didn't know half of the mutants mentioned here, but I still left with a smile on my face. The special effects are great, the cinematography is first rate and the overall feel of the film plays like a gripping action thrill ride. X-Men: Days of Future Past does the seemingly impossible by making it OK to see even the bad X-Men movies. The bigger the mess is made the more fun it is to see it cleaned up I suppose. Of course, it is a movie about time travel and there are a few strange things in regards to that which made the movie a little confusing, but in the end its just small potatoes compared to the massive victory of a film this is. X-Men: Days of Future Past gets a 4.5...out of 5.","

"blackmagic1092","4 September 2014","As once a jaded and disappointed fan of the recent film of x-men 3 and the first stand alone wolverine film. It left a bad taste in my mouth to a point that it took me a long while to watch x-men first class. So walking into this film i had no expectations with nerves on edge. Thankfully i strolled out of that theater with a smile & stomach filled. I was pleased with just about every aspect of the film! Now lets get down to this, yes its a time travel film. As a seasoned veteran of sci-fiction films and TV i can overlook logic and not let it bother me as long as the story is using the tool of time travel well. The characters and circumstances are what is going to sell this plot point. So if time travel drives you crazy then good luck. There wasn't any major issues i could find while using the time travel tool or anything really to knit pick. So the story goes, in the future sentinels which are human military grade machines standing a few stories high made to hunt, capture and kill mutants. While unfortunately, they appeared to have taken over everything on earth & have became an unstoppable force that not even the most powerful mutants can stop. The kicker for the sentinels is that they adapt to every mutant ability within seconds or minutes, hence damn near invincible. How did they manage to develop this ability? well it all goes back to the 1980s( or close to it) if I'm correct where mystique is captured by government authorities after an assassination of a top defense official. In a nut shell they reverse engineer her genes in a sense and weaponize them into the sentinels. Here is the main plot point of the story in which they send wolverine back in time to this period in history to prevent the assassination of the official and stop mystique from carrying out her plan and being captured.Throughout the film the story moves in and out of the past to the present. Wolverine really carries this film while quicksilver is the comedy relieve in terms of his super speed ability which had some truly amazing scenes! The conflict between professor xavier and magneto is high and their conflicting points of view stay steady throughout the story. Magneto is not driven by anything but his believe in the inevitable war between humans and mutants. Beast is living with xavier at the time and is helping him with his disability as a result of magnetos antics in the previous film. While wolverine is recruiting magneto, xavier and quicksilver in the past. It soon turns into a hunt for mystique. Despite magnetos questionable alliance to the group and ultimately hoping to turn the very first sentinel prototypes against the humans. The race to stop both mystique and magneto ensues but every ones fate still rests in the hands of mystique.In the future xavier and magneto are held up in a secret location hiding from the sentinels in the mountians. There is a time table of course and its only a matter of time before the sentinels find them and attack with every weapon in their arsenal. My only problem with this part of the movie is that with so many mutants in the film not many had enough time for character development. There was two unfamiliar mutants named sunspot and blink that were in the film that i didn't have any idea who they were and unfortunately when their deaths arrived it was a little trivial. But their teleportation powers were pretty cool. They were truly obscure characters in the x men universe unless of course your an x men comic junkie. Bishop, iceman, colossus, storm , and kitty pryde were the main mutants. In the final battle storms and magnetos powers were under utilized for the most part. I was expecting them to bring some serious destruction to the attacking sentinels and becoming the last standing mutants but it was short lived and storms death was quick and anti climatic. These were some minor issues i had, but was still entertaining.Lastly this film was a huge step up from the previous films ! the writing was spot on and just about every character in the film was entertaining. There was a few plot holes here and there but none worth mentioning in my opinion! Definitely would consider owning this bad boy. Hopefully the writing stays strong and the characters continue to be true extensions from the source material.","

"j-madej","21 May 2014","Once again director Bryan Singer delivered goods in arguably the greatest X-MEN movie to date in the ""X- MEN Days of Future Past""! Yes indeed, this installment feels like a bridge between the characters and their stories in the past and the future. Made with the estimated budget of $250,000,000 this film needs to make 3 times its cost to be profitable. $750,000,000 to be exact, or more and I believe, judging by an early reviews, it will be one of the most profitable movies of this year. Everything is bigger and better here in all departments. This is the best of Wolverine we've have ever seen. Finely Jackman grew in to his character he embodied in the passed, however now less with rage more so with brute, masculine strength. His veins are practically popping out everywhere on his body. But just because Wolverine has an important part in this story doesn't mean that he hijacked the whole movie in terms of the performance. All the lead actors in their super hero characteristics bring something unique to the table in terms of charisma, otherwise they wouldn't have been casted in the first place, but in ""X-MEN Days of Future Past"" Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg and writer of the story Jane Goldman let other lesser known X-MEN take the stage in the battle for the future of all men kind and mutants. The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The characters from the original X-Men film trilogy join forces with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle that must change the past - to save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. There is a lot to like here in terms of character development from all the actors both in the past as well as the future. Apart from the old characters we know form the previous films like Wolverine/ Hugh Jackman, Professor X/Patrick Stewart, Magnito/Ian McKellen, Storm/Halle Berry we have a newcomers like Nicholas Hoult playing the Beast and of course Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr the younger version of Magnito end emotional James McAvoy as the young and still walking Charles Xavier. Next to Jackman person who quietly steals the movie for me is Raven / Mystique Jennifer Lawrence who practically steals every scene she is in, not only because most of the story plot depends on her character path being good or turning bad or that she is practically naked not counting the blue tight costume she embodies, but in this film we see more of her inner self that till now was not so overexposed. In 1973 her blood will be used to create special robotic machines made by men called the Sentinels that 50 years from then will be the deciding apocalyptic point of the extinction of the world as we know it. The balance between both time frames is handled very well here and keeps viewer in constant state of entertainment in terms of character development going back and forward respectively. I think all the little historical references like Magnito's jail arrest in Pentagon for being accused of killing JFK, or scenes with president Richard Nixon as an example, give the whole story, the additional dimension of historical reference making it more enjoyable and original. The action scenes are full of CGI, but it looks like the money here was spend well, due to the impressive visual scope. Specially the scene of the breakout of Magneto from the Pentagon by our heroes, including the new super fast mutant by the name of Quicksilver (comedically refreshing Evan Peters). That scene is shot brilliantly is super slow-motion were director Bryan Singer filmed Quicksilver's scenes in a special format of 3600 frames a minute. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 1500 times faster than normal running around the room disarming people in instant. Awesome! That scene in itself is worth the 3D admission ticked! From what I have read Bryan Singer will both direct and produce another X-MEN movie set to start production in 2016 titled ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". From the quality of this X-MEN installment I reckon this franchise is in good hands.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique","

"DarthPaul85","24 May 2014","It's hard to review this movie without spoilers, but here it goes:It's a very ""epic"" X-men movie...probably the most epic yet. For better or worse, there's a lot going on in this movie- future and past time-lines and characters...if I have one complaint, it's that there's so much to the story that some scenes happen too quickly just because they need to.There are also some head-scratching lines of dialogue and plot elements (don't even get me started on how the time-line is supposed to work with the previous movies).But that's all being technical, the movie succeeds where it needs to: the story is interesting, the acting is good, the action is pretty awesome (though we don't get as much as I wanted), and the effects are the best yet. A lot of people are raving about this movie, and I hate to say I don't really know why- it was good, but not great. I wouldn't say it's the best X-men movie, but it's a welcomed addition.","

Bryan Singer still have the ability to turn all the subtitling of the plot into convincing visual landscape.

For this kind of films we receive usually this kind of acting, sometimes we expect better.All in all I am not sure that it deserves to be among top 250 film on IMDb page, it is just another sci fi film.P.S.

"neil-476","23 May 2014","In the future, Sentinels - giant robots which were introduced to eliminate mutants - have destroyed civilisation. The few surviving X-Men, in desperation, send Wolverine's mind back to his 1973 body in order to persuade Professor X and Magneto to prevent the incident which led to the creation of the Sentinels. Unfortunately, 1973 Professor X is a drunk depressive.This film brings together the casts of the original X-Men trilogy and the First Class prequel in a loose adaptation of one of the classic story arcs from the comics. Placing fan favourite Wolverine front and centre, it tells a fairly dense story which centres mainly on the younger cast from the prequel. It deals with some of the continuity issues which arose due to the prequel (Xavier's paralysis) but not all of them (the different Emma Frosts in First Class and Wolverine: Origin are more or less forgotten), and creates some of its own (the teaser at the end of The Wolverine makes little sense as Xavier and Lensherr would not desperately need Wolverine's help at that point).Who cares? The super-hero action is phenomenal, we see more mutants than ever before (some are blink or you'll miss 'em), and there is some heart and emotion - the key relationships between Xavier, Raven and Lensherr are addressed - and the story is perfectly satisfactory. Jennifer Lawrence is hot, deadly, blue, and sometimes quite moving, and all the principals give good performances. Worries about young P. Maximoff Esq prove groundless - he looks fine, his characterisation is terrific (if different to the comics), and he features n one of the stand-out set pieces.I thoroughly enjoyed this, and it is a worthy addition to the X-Men collection.","

"AaronCapenBanner","15 December 2014","Seventh ""X-Men"" film is the darkest yet, as lethal giant mutant-killing robots called Sentinels have hunted down nearly all mutants, leaving a handful of survivors including Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto(Ian McKellen) who devise a desperate plan to send Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) back in time by sending his mind into his 1973 self, where he must convince the younger Xavier and Magneto to team up and stop Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) from inadvertently causing the disaster in the first place... Though lots of skill is on display here, the use of time-travel is preposterous, not to mention disturbingly nihilistic(what's to prevent the past from being changed again, without some kind of order to stop it?) and ultimately self-defeating, trying to rectify previous films' perceived mistakes that really weren't, and only succeeding in creating a big mess itself far worse than the previous films! Should have left well enough alone without the contrived inclusion of time-travel, a real cheat and cop-out after the plot paints itself into a corner it never should have in the first place...","

"adityakumarprasad","24 May 2014","Yes, that's true. It did not give me as much thrill as I would have expected from a X-Men series. I would rather suggest you watch X-Men: First Class, again. The X-Mens send Wolverine back in time to alter an event where the government gets hold of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and they use her DNA to make mutant killing machines. Hence the name of the movie. The first half still went well as there was enough humour, thrill and action involved. Especially the scene where Magneto is being taken away from the Pentagon. One laughable moment I would specially like to mention here is that Magneto was prisoned for killing of JFK and later he tells Professor that he was trying to save JFK and not kill him, since JFK was also one of them - a mutant! #TooMuchEven though I love Jennifer Lawrence more than anyone in Hollywood, even though this movie has so much of her, the story line disappointed me and left me wanting for more. Less action, less thrill, less of everything that you expect from an X-Men movie. I would rather watch The Hunger Games again and again to get more from Jennifer. She is too good in that movie, if you have still not seen it, do it now. Special Mention: PVR's 3D glasses sucked big time. As always I repented not going for a 2D show. Just like the earlier release this month - The Amazing Spiderman, I would ask you to give this X- Men also a miss.","

"Terryfan","15 August 2015","This was the first Marvel Movie I saw in theaters the first one in seven years. From the moment I saw the trailer I knew this would be the film I would need to see in theaters. It was worth the price of the ticket to me. X-Men: Days Of Future Past. I suggest Watching all the X-men Films along with The Wolverine and X-Men: First Class to fully Understand this film story line wiseThe film is full of stars from both the original X-Men films and X- Men: First Class.Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult,Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen are among those who reprise their roles from their respected X-men films along with cameosAlso we are introduce to New comers to the X-men Daniel Cudmore, Bingbing Fan, Evans Peters, Adam Canto, BooBoo Stewart. Peter Dinklage is cast playing Dr. Bolivar Trask the main antagonist and his performance is very strong in this film he really took the time to make the film work for his character. All the rest of the cast did a great job. Jennifer,Patrick,Hugh, James and Michael help made the film very strong.The story for this film really gets your attention from the start and if you're not careful it will make your head turn because it made my head turn with the plot twists throughout the film so be careful or you'll miss something.The writers did a clever job with the plot of the film. Music also is very well written to help tell the story of the film. Also the effects for X-Men: Days Of Future Past is very impressive and if you watch it in 3D you'll be in awe by the effects it goes to show that Marvel knows what they want with the films. Everything about this film is worth your time if you're a fan of Marvel and X-men in general You will be impress.With a good story, strong performances from the cast and superb effects you will be impressI give X-Men: Days Of Future Past an 8 out of 10","

"cherold","2 November 2014","Tieing with X-Men First Class for best movie of the series, DOFP is a blast from the insanely exciting opening battle. The action scenes are all well done, and there is a scene with Quicksilver taking on a roomful of armed men that is absolutely brilliant.I often feel modern action films are a little too desperate to keep BIG THINGS happening all the time (it was my objection The Avengers), but DOFP is nicely paced, focusing more on character than special effects, even though the special effects are terrific. It's a relatively thoughtful take on the comic book movie.There is one plot point that I felt was weak. Basically, a decision is made in the beginning that results in trouble later on, and it's something anyone with half a brain would have foreseen. And the case for that decision seemed severely under-developed. It's a flaw I can live with, but I wish it weren't there.","

"sushant0406","20 September 2014","Really had been waiting to watch this installment of the X-Men,one of my favourite series. Needless to say it was far more entertaining than the second Wolverine movie and X Men-3.The story was well written, although would have been better had they explained the time-travel aspect a little more. The story picks up in 2023, when the sentinels have all but eliminated the mutants and the humans who had tried to defend them. The only was is to go back in the past and stop an assassination, that would inturn cause the sentinels to be made.Of the cast, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine marches right from the front. This has been his best portrayal as Wolverine. Jackman's acting is on the rise since Les Miserables and again he was truly impressive. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, were again superb in their respective roles of the younger Professor X and Magneto; especially McAvoy. Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage and Nicholas Hoult were also good in their respective roles. However there was not enough screen time for Patrick Stewart(old Professor X), Sir Ian McKellen(old Magneto) and Halle Berry(Storm) to make a mark on the viewers and their performances could be regarded as a guest appearance at the most. Ellen Page, again had hardly any screen time, but did a decent job. The other X Men, sadly to say were wasted. But, this was expected,wasn't it?The major disappointment for me was the lack of a characteristic Marvel soundtrack, that would give a normal guy goosebumps.The energy was totally amiss, because of that. However, like most other Marvel movies there is an end credit scene, which from the looks of it was good and I would like to see the characters shown in that scene, in the next X- Men movie.","

"cindysbr","1 October 2014","Was supposed to write this in goofs but maybe interested viewers can find this a major critique as well and some geek out there can help me out. Good movie and production overall. Just one thing: How in the world is Prof X is still alive? Reboot you say? In that case, reminiscing Jean Grey's demise IN this movie by Wolverine himself then also pertains to the Prof's death in that installment! So how do these two fit together?? Medium-core audiences are supposed to just gloss over this? As mentioned, still a great watch- the story is good, a few goofs with references to items non-existent in the 70's, worth watching already if you're just gonna replay scenes with Raven in it- Jennifer Lawrence is super, super hot. Best character for pimply fans of xmen and material for a fantasy porn raven- a sexual partner that can change to anyone, or ANY PART of her that you desire... whoops, just veered off. I'll cut here.","

"rollsroyce16","31 May 2014","X-Men Days of Future Past showed just little enough in the trailers to not let you know that the entire movie was going to be butchered, but just enough to make it seem incredible. The entire movie was made simply to rectify the Giant Sh*t that Brett Ratner on X-Men The Last Stand. Of course the could have used about 1/3 of the movie to fix what Ratner did by killing off all the good/main characters. But instead the whole movie was used to follow a story line that doesn't make any logical sense. Movies that depend on moving to the past to change the future are improbably to direct properly, because no matter what the conflict is, there is an easier way to go about it, i.e. go back a little further then planned and stop the beginning conflict from taking affect (hard to go into detail without spoiling.) All in all 20th Century & Marvel did a fantastic job of stealing your money, putting Jennifer Lawrence on a pedestal (Mystique is supposed to stay blue most of the time, that's the point) and showing that Hugh Jackman can be an old man & ripped.","

"bobcolganrac","28 May 2014","Special effects in XMDOFP are amazing as we've come to expect from modern big screen 3D bonanzas.But the story line is weak. And that's why I can't rate this movie higher. It just doesn't cut the cerebral mustard. Unsatisfying to me, in the end....I wanted it to be more, and it didn't deliver it. But I am certain that to other viewers it was quite satisfying. It's a well done piece of cinema.The movie plot borrows from a number of others (Star Trek '09, Inception, The Matrix, Terminator 2) . . . and wasn't consequently that original. This is too bad. Given the budget and acting talent they had they could have come up with something a little more interesting ...and they should have.I believe Singer was aspiring to achieve a genuine comic book look....and the attacks of the Sentinels with energy of all kinds being thrown around, he succeeded. However, it was for me too much of a good thing....I found them a bit too weird. Still, the CGI special effects are on a par with the best that have been done. Amazing. Fantastic choreography on the fighting sequences. The movie thrives on such action.(I think it worth noting that people no longer refer to them as 'computer generated' but just 'special effects' ----the ineluctable transition toward seamless Singularity apparently on schedule) I will say that Quicksilver's actions were to my thinking the best of the movie----the scene in the kitchen of the Pentagon where he takes out all the guards and redirects the plastic bullets by first running around at warp speed: absolutely great ! A Great scene ! Quicksilver is now my favorite mutant!!Acting is topnotch. I cannot think of a poor character rendition in this....Michael Fassbender playing the young Magneto shows once again why he is one of today's very elite cinema faces....he has a power to hold the camera, to capture the viewer's attention---the mark of a great actor. It's a high-octane cast, and they deliver.The final plot development didn't work. Magneto's dramatic ""relocation"" of the sports stadium seemed odd-----visually novel, but a strangely over-the-top ploy that seemed unnecessary. If he was trying to make a statement, he could have done it by other, less excessive means. Maybe I just don't understand how Magneto's mind works.....maybe it's me. Probably.I was hoping to be blown away by this movie....at least really pleasantly surprised by it. And I wasn't. Held back by a plot that could have been a hair stronger. Again, very good, but not great. 7.75, could we use fractions.","

"farhangpark-40-66371","26 June 2014","I don't know, maybe I've just seen too many movies and shows that deal with the idea of time travel, but this film is cliché down to the roots.So what angered me off the most? The whole idea of time travel. If time travel is possible, then you wouldn't be living in the world you're living in right now because you would have sent someone in the past to change things forever.Again, if time travel is possible and someone's trying to change the past right now, why would I care what might happen to the people who live in the present? The person in the past has all the time to change their fates! There is no tension in what might happen to these guys. And of course, this is a superhero film so everything's going to work out just fine so really again there is no real tension in the scenes. Altogether, the film felt like a bizarre mix of three films:1. The Matrix: in that film there were machines that connected humans to a program. Here we have Ellen Paige who sends people's conscience back in time. You decide which is more convincing! Also so much acting, Ellen: Just put your hands around Hugh's head and moan and groan a little. Just top notch. 2. Inception: the original film had three different levels of dream, pretty good idea. X-Men however decided that what happens in present time matters as much as what happens in the past and so lost my any kind of attention to one of the time lines or a quarter of the film. 3. Back to the Future: Not as much as the humor but actually the idea of time travel which doesn't make any more sense here than it made in that film. At least that one was funny.Now I have criticized the film pretty harshly but there are some good moments here just as well.The CGI is pretty cool, the 3D effect alright and the acting is quite acceptable, at least they shut Halle Berry up for most of the time and kept Ellen Paige to a minimum and painted Jennifer Lawrence in blue which actually made her more tolerable than her Oscar worthy performances!Again if you have watched a total of 5 episodes of Family Guy, Rick and Morty or Community about time travel, there's really nothing you haven't seen before. If you're a fan, eating up a popcorn and enjoying the glasses, this might be just the film you've been waiting for.PS: Don't waste your money on the 4D versions if they're around. The whole shooting scenes and kicks and rainy weathers just feel uncomfortable when they're turned into kicks in the back, hisses of water and actual sprinkles. Stick to the 3D version for Christs sake.Final Rating: 5/10. Cliché but actually OK and at times enjoyable. Recommended for non-fans? Not really. Pretty basic time travel stuff.","

"tavm","28 May 2014","Well, Bryan Singer outdid himself again in his third outing as the director of an X-Men film! Quite an awesome mix of the younger/older versions of Professor X and Magneto with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine being the connection between them as he gets sent by them to the '70s to prevent a war involving the giant robots called the Sentinels. Also involved are the '70s version of The Beast and Quicksilver. Oh, yes, there's also Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. So not only is there awesome action but also pertinent dialogue in advancing the story and characterization which was based on Chris Claremont's writing when he plotted the comic series during the '70s/'80s. So on that note, I highly recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past.","

"Robert_duder","13 June 2014","If nothing else (and this is coming from a die-hard DC fan) Marvel will forever be known for doing their franchises right time and time again. Best of all, they are not afraid of staying strict to their comic roots and making their scripts and characters diverse, fiercely intelligent and complex. I wish more than anything I had sunk myself into the entire X-Men series again before going into this and I absolutely recommend doing exactly that before going into this. I know you don't NEED to but it would help IMMENSELY! Days Of Future Past is a complex web of a story that holds nothing back. Don't get me wrong, it makes perfect sense and it is a sci-fi/action lover's dream. I know my low score (comparatively to others) might make you upset but I assure you I thought this was excellently crafted. I just found myself a tad bit lost in trying to remember everything that came before it. I was certain that director Bryan Singer would complicate this more than it should have been. Most fans agree he dropped the ball with X-Men 3 but I am proud to say he actually used the old cast in the best possible way (minimizing their involvement.) However, where I felt the film stumbled just a little was the lack of characters in it. It certainly focuses on Wolverine, young Magneto and young Charles but the amazing cast from the ""First Class"" film are sadly lacking. There really isn't any additional development in the characters and despite a strong action storyline, it falls in character development. Its one and only flaw.I think we've all long agreed Hugh Jackman is and always will be Wolverine/Logan. I can't say much else about him because he becomes the character, he is iconic and amazing in the role. He was the one good thing about the disastrous Wolverine film from last year. However, this time around felt a little lacking for him and it wasn't his usual level of performance in the role. I could say the same for the rest of the cast honestly. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely astonishing in First Class as younger counterparts to Xavier and Magneto. They were still good in this but it was missing that same level of ""wow"" factor. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique probably got the most development of the cast in this film and yet she still didn't seem to be as great as she was in the original and we know all these actors are fantastic. I think Singer focused so much on the script that he sort of uses the characters as backdrop to the story. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan return in their iconic roles and they are used sparingly but perfectly for the course of the film without getting in the way. Same for the rest of the old cast who are really barely there including Halle Berry and a few tiny cameos from the original X-Men cast. Nicholas Hoult and Ellen Page have important roles but again very small comparatively to First Class. Peter Dinklage was a great addition as our ""villain"" of sorts. He did a terrific job but (I'm going to say it again) underused.The heart of this story is the Sentinel program and the time travel aspect in a desperate attempt to stop cataclysmic destruction in the future. The Sentinels were every comic geeks focal point going into this. The build up to finally seeing them for the first time was perfect and they don't disappoint. They are exactly what any fan would want. The other thing Days of Future Past knocks clear out of the park are the special effects...WOW. This was some of the best CGI and special effects I have seen in years. Give them an Oscar right now because nothing comes close. Nothing looks fake or cheap and the scenes are awe inspiring. Singer did some truly outstanding direction here and he should be heralded for it. The one flaw...which I think I've explained enough is that the characters feel just a little underdeveloped and I like my superheroes to be complex characters which X-Men has always done very well. I'm a little surprised the reaction this is getting from fans. Even a friend of mine called it ""the best superhero film ever made."" I can't quite agree with that. It definitely jumps some seriously astounding hurdles but I still don't feel in a lot of ways it matched First Class or even some of the earlier X-Men films. Still a first rate summer blockbuster!! 8.5/10","

"mikecart1","22 May 2014","Not going to give spoilers, but let's just say this: I haven't watched a movie in theaters like this since TDK trilogy where you were actually hoping the movie wouldn't end and that the story would continue.This movie from beginning to end is top notch in story telling, action, and in keeping to the source material. As a huge fan of the time travel saga from the X-Men cartoons, this movie was just amazing. You get all the characters of that time which include Bishop and his friends.On the other side, you get the past and present characters of the X-Men. You get cameos here and there. Mystique and Wolverine were awesome.For those that want jokes, this movie has them. However, this movie is a lot darker than the Avengers, Captain America, and Thor movies. I would put the ""dark"" level in between TDK and Ironman 1.Overall, see this MOVIE NOW! Also stay for the ending. You haven't got goosebumps yet until you see what I saw!!! 10 out of 10! A rare perfect movie. Blows away the other X-Men movies and is the best Marvel movie made yet!","

"bkbirge","24 June 2014","Surprisingly good! If you've seen many of the recent crop of super-hero sci-fi schlock that's been released then you'll understand why this is a surprise.The premise is that Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent the horrible Terminator style future all the mutants are experiencing. There is plenty of eye candy CGI and explosions and all the usual suspects make cameos. In that way it's similar to other offerings but this one, unlike those, has an engaging story. True there is probably nothing earth shatteringly new here but the deft handling keeps it from ever feeling like a paint by numbers tent-pole.Wolverine doesn't do much Wolverine, he's mainly used as a POV character for us to bridge the past and the future. Peter Dinklage plays the gov't villain and while I always love seeing him on screen his character seems underutilized. Hugh Jackman carries the movie in terms of character and acting chops though the cast in general was very well chosen, there are just so many of them we only get a little bit of time with each. Young Xavier and Magneto reprise their roles from the previous movie and Mystique looks better than ever and we actually get a bit of character development from her. Giamatti has a great scene chewing couple scenes that are far too short, I can only hope he and Dinklage will be used more in future movies. It would be awesome to see a spectacle genre movie that also let some of these great actors loose.The world building holds together very well, not as many obvious anachronisms. I didn't feel the effort to hold suspension of disbelief like I have in other recent genre flicks. Special mention for the scenes with Quicksilver showing off his powers, those were particularly effective.If they can keep this quality up for the future offerings then I will be going for sure. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.","

Reunited with filmmaker Bryan Singer's singular vision and a strong script by fellow X writers Simon Kinberg, Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn keep things moving at a decent clip in spite of its groovy '70s era exposition and some fast and furious visual effects (among them future X'er 'Quicksilver' - a game Peters - shaking things up with his wicked fast speed to much welcome comic relief).

"Wuchakk","5 October 2014","""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) starts in an apocalyptic near-future where mutants are being wiped out by Sentinels, government-made robots created for this very purpose. The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.This is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face.The plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto's great power is illustrated (you'll see what I mean).The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Québec, Canada.GRADE: A","

When Charles meets Mystique for the first time in X-Men First Class (which took place in the 60's), they are children, and they both have powers. Charles is clearly quite powerful in X-Men First Class.Other than that, it's a terrific movie. I'm looking forward to watching them all in chronological order:X-Men First Class (2011)

At just the right pacing throughout the film, the scene where James McAvoy's Charles Xavier and Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier meet in their minds was just one of the best; well-written and well performed. Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart made this film even more intriguing with their presence.Special mention must go to the music composer John Ottman. The musical score of Days of Future Past was simply amazing! It not only captured each scene perfectly, but drove the film deeper into drama and deeper emotions. The music in the scene mentioned above, as well as the near-ending scene when Mystique had made up her mind finally, was top-notch, keeping the viewer intensely engaged!Great job Bryan Singer, and the cast of Days of Future Past.","

"george59883-36-312142","24 June 2014","This is a well told story. The time travel is so complicated, but it is easy to follow. Xavier is truly the focal point. The Wolverine is only there to get a ball rolling and create this change. Erik and Xavier are still having the same argument they are making in every other film and Mystique still doesn't know who to side with. She can't decide what she wants to be. She has to choose her own path. Mystique is brilliantly acted in this film by Jennifer Lawrence. I loved her portrayal in First Class and anyone should be glad about this performance because she turns into Rebecca Romijn. James McAvoy falls away in this role and equally brilliant in his role is Michael Fassbender. Each of these men give the characters a dynamic that is so much better in this film. The weaknesses of some of the first films is the fact that the didn't get a lot of screen time together, but in this film they get to play out their struggles to each other and fight over their beliefs. Mystique is in the middle and she has to fight the both of them. Magneto is the villain of the past in this film and it is so great to see that he still the same Magneto that we love. A man who is hurt from his experiences. Nicholas Hoult is also really cool as Beast and his change is also explained. Hoult is there as a support for Xavier and it takes a talent to be able to handle your own against Hugh Jackman. Hugh Jackman is Huge Jacked Man. He is the most fit person I have ever seen in my life and is brilliant in his role as Wolverine. Hugh takes this to a new level and his also added dimension. Trask is a villain that you get what he is doing and has a clear motivation that I really enjoyed. Peter Dinklage's height is pleasantly absent from the script and is satisfying for this character and actor. You don't like Trask, but you can see where he is coming from. Peter is even one of the best parts of the film. His comedy and action blows you out of the water. The hint at the his relations to Magneto and it isn't very overbearing about it. His action scene is also so good that it is on the level of Nightcrawler's raid on The White House.I also have to give a hand to Bryan Singer. I believe that it is hard to come back to a franchise a couple films removed and he did an excellent job. He was able to go from future to past so seamlessly that it is really cool and the action is so well directed. You also have to give a hand to Simon Kinberg and Mathew Vaughn as well because they also had to write this story that seamlessly goes between times and each time brings its own feeling and that comes from the writing itself. Kinberg does a great job of bringing in the funny comedic moments without it going into silliness. The special effects are really great and are well done. The sentinels in the past looked like a newly made creation with the limitations of the time and the future sentinels are well explained why they look like that and are quite frightening. The time travel is so well done that you give credit to the people behind the camera who have to set it up well.The future in itself is its own film. Each of the introduced mutants don't just seem like characters that need to be there so they can die or CGI tricks. They each get a moment to bring some kind of emotion to the screen. Professor X an Magneto in the future are so well done that they are friends and you get to see them together and you just enjoy yourself by seeing it. The future sentinels, like I said, are scary. They are frightening. When every future scene comes on my heart is pounding because of how well the suspense is built. The history of this film is so interesting that you can see where the future might be going, but you don't know how its going to get there.I am flabbergasted about how well this film balances the time travel aspects and while being a pretty dark film and also balances the comedy as well. The time travel might over complicate the already confusing canon of the X-Men universe, but I only question it because of how good this film does on so many other levels of fixing the canon. Singer returns with a competent direction with the help of Kinberg's well written script. The action and effects is spectacular. Each actor gives a great performance that helps blend the two times together even more fluently. I am fan of superhero films that are simultaneously another genre at the same time. This is a great time travel film and a great superhero film. This is a great film and deserves a 3.75 out 4 stars.","

"haveb-32531","19 January 2022","When I first saw this movie, I was thrilled with it. I loved everything it did for the franchise, action movies and the superhero genre in general. Now, years and a lot of superhero movies later, it's still a great movie, but maybe not as iconic as I thought it was. For one thing, it still has that awkward Bryan Singer length. By the 1 ½ mark, I was ready to leave. For more than two hours of film, that's a problem. I got into it, but pacing has always been a problem for him. This is probably the film's biggest problem, because otherwise it really works. The action is great, the themes are great, the characters are great, and there are just some stellar moments here. When I see McAvoy and Stewart in the same scene, I still get goosebumps. It's not a perfect movie, but damn, it's a good movie, and it does its best to fix what was becoming a confusing timeline for this franchise.","

"JohnDeSando","24 May 2014","""So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?"" Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)It's not set if you can, like Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), go 50 years back into 1973 and stop the creation of the Sentinels, Terminator- like robot warriors created by scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), whose robots always defeat the mutants: ""From the beginning, the Sentinels were targeting the X-Men. Then they began targeting everyone."" (Wolverine)So the plot of the exciting X-Men: Days of Future Past begins. The use of mutants in the Vietnam War, and the war itself, serve as a conflict backdrop to show the path to annihilation begun even without the help of Sentinels. This iteration of a Marvel Comics hero collective is more complex and philosophical than its predecessors with new characters (mostly young versions of the X-men and women) that lend variety and interest and a measure of actor charisma. Besides the usual sturm and drang of robot arms like Gatling guns with eyes like beacons, this film has heart and humor as mutants and their leaders, Professor Xavier and his nemesis- now-bud, Magneto (Ian Mckellen), convene to send Logan back to convince their younger selves (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender) to save surviving humans and sometimes to deal with misunderstood loves and friendships.When director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg open with a moving shot of downtrodden mutants and sympathizers marching in unison, Fritz Lang's silent-movie Metropolis immediately comes to mind, and it evokes the theme of the oppressed waiting to rise up against the ruling class. Holocaust-like images of mutants and their sympathizers herded for internment camps chillingly reveal a doomed New York City.The mutants are, after all, different, and in current conservative thinking, enemies of the good American life, lily white that is. As the various outliers, including the X-Men, fight for equality and against suppression, Hollywood again does a credible job of mixing imaginative action with contemporary lives of the disadvantaged.Our heroes struggling with a vendetta-prone Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) adds interest to the usual survival motifs. She kicks butt with the best of them while she carries through her plan that actually dooms humans and mutants even more.The cast is terrific, even if the story goes on too long, as the film moves thrillingly from a sober beginning: ""Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction...."" Professor Xavier","

"Carycomic","24 May 2014","For starters, it provides a suitable explanation for Stewart-Xavier's restored mobility in the flashback prologue of X-MEN 3: THE LAST STAND. It also provides a suitable substitute for the character of Robert Kelly, who was the predestined target of assassination in the original Chris Claremont comic book story. But, who (as played by Bruce Davison) was killed off in the very first X-MEN movie, as all true fans of that film remember.The mutant rebels in the opening action scene were also intriguing. In addition to returning favorites like Iceman, Shadowcat, and Colossus, there were also relative newcomers Bishop (no mistaking those dreadlocks!) and Sunspot. Although, I have to confess; Adan Canto, the actor portraying the latter, bore a slightly greater resemblance to the actress who played Callisto in X-3! In fact, I was thinking to myself, while watching the opening battle of this film: ""Is this supposed to be Callisto's dystopian future-son by Cannonball?!""Then, there's Peter Dinklage who played Bolivar Trask. I loved it when he played Arthur Ramsey, the egotistical mental giant recruited for the alien-busting Federal task force in THRESHOLD (the short-lived, and criminally under-rated, 2005 CBS sci-fi series). And, the believability he brought to that role he transferred to his depiction of Trask with absolutely no trouble, at all!For me, however, the highlight of the film was the new meaning Bryan Singer gave to the old phrase, ""a meeting of the minds,"" when he had Stewart-Xavier telepathically confer with his younger self (convincingly played, once again, by James MacEvoy).In short, then, I think the X-men movie franchise has been safely re-secured. Thanks to Bryan Singer being once more at the directorial helm.","

"divyankk","26 May 2014","The movie starts with Professor X and Megneto in the year 2023. The first question is after the movie (last stand), How Professor X is alive? and How did Megneto has his powers?.The movie went into the Past so it looked like watching a movie in the 20th Century. I expected a WOW series movie like the last few movies of X men. This movie rating should drop according to me because there was less of visual effects and animation then the movies released in first few years of the 21st century. There was less of action compared to old movies.In the movie {first class (2011)} we were shown that the serum drawn from Raven's DNA was a failure but in this movie it is shown it is a success.","

"fcabanski","11 December 2016","The story isn't bad, but the characters and acting are awful.The core group - Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Raven/Malice, even Storm are fine. But the rest - either the character or actor, or both, are awful. Half the cast is like something from a weekend cosplay convention.Bad Characters - Talk about generic people and generic powers. There's the cold guy, surfing around on ice. There's the hot guy, firing flame all over the place. For some reason, Sentinel hot stolen from hot guy trumps cold guy powers, and Sentinel cold stolen from cold guy trumps hot guy powers. They're just examples of generic characters or lame characters - there's one guy whose power is to make people throw up. There's not a lot of thought into how many of these people use their powers. It's like watching a bunch of video game players poorly express powers in generic ways.Bad Acting - Halle Berry is a bad actress. She's wooden. But at least she is natural - she just doesn't express much emotion. Half the cast doesn't appear natural when delivering lines. If Halle Berry makes you look bad, then you're really bad.Many of the actors and actresses in this movie pose their lines. They also make weird body motions when they express their powers - the flail arms down, head tilt, shoulder shrug, or hard nod forward. Wolverine throws his hands down when he extends his claws, but he makes it look natural. The bad ones, and there are many of them, don't make it look good.The fights are decent, if a little generic. The plot is weak.This is only a good superhero movie to people who think special effects are all that counts.","

"vyshakhj20","25 May 2014","I liked everything about the movie from the beginning till the end. Although there were some plot holes, but considering how awesome the movie was it could be compromised.Being a fan of X-men I went for the movie on the same day it was released, I had it in my mind that the movie would be lame as The Wolverine. But to my surprise it wasn't and in fact it was just the opposite.Bit of humor here and there made the movie even more awesome. I might go watch it again.So guys, If you really enjoyed watching this movie and if you think your time and money was worth it, then give it 10 stars, lets not have this movie go underrated.","

"gumperman","23 May 2014","I just got back from seeing this and I'm awestruck! I heard in an interview with Bryan Singer, the director of this film, the original film that started it all, 2000's X-Men & the sequel X2: X-Men United, that in this film, he was trying to tie everything that had happened after the first two movies and fix the problems. In that I say he did a spot on job and bravo! If you are a fan of these films, I guarantee this will be your favorite of the franchise! It is so good! The action is wonderful, the story is intriguing to follow and the film looks great and sounds awesome. I'm one of those film fans that noticed that the first three films in the franchise, start out in the same way in that after the 20th Century Fox logo comes on and then fades to black, the 'X' in Fox stays a bit longer before eventually fading too. I was hoping since Singer was back with the franchise, that this little treat to the fans would return too, and it does! I was so pumped when I saw this, not to mention the use of Ottman's X2 theme towards the end of the 20th Century Fox logo as well. Oh and I loved, LOVED, Quicksilver's scene! Practically sole the show! :)","

"PyroSikTh","23 May 2014","Days of Future Past is a brilliant amalgamation of both eras of the X-Men franchise. After Origins and First Class, it was presumed we'd never see the traditional cast set in the modern day again. Then Wolverine came along set almost ten years after the events of Last Stand, and it also teased Days of Future Past with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen appearing in the post-credits scene. Days of Future Past, in that respect, feels like having your cake and eating it too. It's a direct sequel to two completely different movies in the franchise, containing the casts of both eras, and using the perfect source material to do so. It ties everything together really nicely by default of having all these actors together.However, while it does tie the two strands together, it also takes gross liberties with continuity. If you watch all seven movies in release order, you'll start to notice a number of things don't add up. The most crucial is, after Last Stand, how are Xavier and Magneto alive and fully operational? Xavier died, and Magneto lost his powers, but they're quite obviously around and kicking twenty years later. Obviously there are explanations. The end of Last Stand hints at Magneto's powers returning, and Xavier mentioned transporting his conscious to another body, however none of these are even mentioned in Days of Future Past. You're expected just to go along with it. Another fairly crucial bit of continuity is Wolverine's claws. Obviously in 1973 they're not coated in adamantium, while in 2023 they are. Problem with this is that Wolverine lost the adamantium coating at the end of Wolverine, which is set in the present day. It's hard to believe Wolverine would willingly get his claws re-coated in the ten years between. There's a number of other little niggles, but they're honestly not worth pointing out.Balancing that out, however, are a number of great nods to previous events. Obviously a lot is carried over from First Class as it picks up on Magneto, Xavier, and Beast almost ten years later. For me, the greatest nod to the running plot of the franchise, however, is that of Wolverine's origin. I mean when you really think about it, Origins is pretty much redacted, but I think almost everyone did that in their heads already, so it's no loss. The running plot of Wolverine's turmoil is touched on once again here as he finds himself face-to-face with a young William Stryker. This emotional jarring has some pretty huge ramifications on the story, which is great, and it's picked up again at the end to explain how he's still got adamantium grafted to his bones.The story itself is pretty great, although I can't say it's without it's holes (the most crucial of which I've already mentioned). Being a time-travel story, it will always take a number of watches and some thinking through to really connect all the dots and make sure everything works, but with Days of Future Past, it doesn't even matter. The wider continuity has little to no effect on the story the movie wants to tell. There are nods here and there, but you can tell they just wanted to tell a good X-Men story without having to worry about everything, and they did. There's some great character work here, with Xavier at his lowest point, Magneto slipping into his villainous persona we all know, Mystique's struggle of choice over destiny, and Wolverine's past constantly coming back to him. It's also pretty unpredictable. Once we entered the third act I just thought to myself; 'I know we're nearing the end, but I don't have a clue how they're going to solve this.' But what I liked most was how the future glimpse wasn't merely used a bookend, but it's revisited a number of times throughout, ramping up the tension and raising the stakes even higher than they already were.The visuals were pretty great, as were the action scenes themselves. The post-apocalyptic future that needs to be avoided is bleak. New York City is in ruins, and everywhere is patrolled by these nigh-invincible Sentinels (that actually look a lot like the Destroyer in Thor). Beyond the landscapes and sentinels, the effects work here is pretty great too. It all looks quite obviously futuristic with bizarre flying carriers for the sentinels and holographic gadgets, but also the mutant abilities are rendered really well. Colossus and Iceman of course turn their skin into another material, but there's other's like Blink's portals and Bishops...ability, whatever the hell that was. There's also a great scene with Quicksilver taking on a whole room of guards in his own sweet time, and having a load of fun with it; moving the guards so they punch themselves, or trip over nothing, moving the bullets so they miss their targets, all the while listening to some pretty at-odds music. Days of Future Past isn't the best film, it's not the best superhero film, hell it's not even the best X-Men film (although on that last one, it's not far off), but it's a thoroughly enjoyable romp nonetheless. If nothing else, it's an excuse to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen together once again. It's the perfect way to tie together the franchise's separate continuities and give us fans the best of both worlds. There's also a cheeky post-credits scene, so make sure you stay for that. We were literally the only ones waiting for it (amateurs), and while it probably means more to those who read the comics, it implies some pretty monumental things to come in Age of Apocalypse. I give Days of Future Past a very good 8/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/","

"ThomasDrufke","22 May 2014","Out of all the major superhero franchises we have today, the X-Men franchise has been the weakest in my opinion. I like the original two X-men films, First Class, and The Wolverine a lot. But in terms of the best overall franchise, it has never blown me away like other superhero movies had. But Days of Future Past is everything I had hoped and more. It brings together the original cast, and the younger cast from First Class together in one big epic movie. It also happens to introduce a few new mutants to the big screen that turned out to be more than impressive.Right from the opening scene, you realize the franchise is back in Bryan Singer's hands who helmed the first two critically acclaimed X-men films. Literally the first 10 minutes show us the unique powers of some of the lesser known mutants such as Blink, Sunspot, and Bishop. Everyone's introduction was spot on and brings back the chills I had when first seeing X-men. The film then starts to set in motion the plans to send Wolverine's consciousness back in time to his younger self in order to stop Mystique from killing Boliver Trask. Jennifer Lawrence was great as both Raven and Mystique as you can tell she struggles to cope with everything bad that has happened to mutants the years following the Cuban crisis.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender once again shine as Charles Xavier and Magneto respectively. The two old friends go through many more ups and downs this go around, and you can tell how much more comfortable these actors felt in their roles. Ultimately this film is about hope, and which of the mutants can overcome their hatred and restore hope within the mutant community and together with humans.Even though Hugh Jackman is once again the star of the movie, it's hard not to think about how good everyone else is in the movie. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, who everyone including myself were bashing on how bad he looked in the trailers, was hilariously awesome in this movie. He had probably some of the best scenes of the entire movie by himself. Overall I loved this movie and it is by far my favorite X-men film, and one of the best superhero movies of all time.I have to also mention the brief cameos of Cyclops and Jean Grey. It wasn't overly shocking, but I thought it definitely gave me butterflies knowing Bryan Singer found a way to bring them back.+Quicksilver and the other new mutants +Performances across the board+those cameos......+JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING -left wanting more Rogue10/10","

"donb-519-335075","10 February 2015","Prior to watching the latest edition of this very popular series, I put the curse of death on the movie: ""I have enjoyed every X-Men movie, this has to be good."" OOPs - sorry - from that point on the movie did not have a chance.Granted, back to the future/time travel movies are confusing anyway, but this one was a mess.So let's briefly summarize what was going on in the plot: Giant super robots are killing the mutants - so far so good. They are arriving in the present (around 2023) in flying coffins - and the mutants (Wolverine, Scott, Storm - the usual suspects) are alarmed because they know they (our good favorite mutants) cannot kill the bad robots - because we have seen them do it. And how did this happen? In the past - (1973 to be exact) Mystique killed the evil dwarf Dr. Trask who was developing the giant killer robots and since he was gone, the program went forward (I guess in his memory.)So - let's (X-Men) send somebody back to 1973 to stop Mystique from killing the evil dwarf and all will be fine. So who can do this? - naturally Wolverine (any body who can hop up and down for over three minutes ought to be equal to this simple task.) Well, Wolverine goes back to 1973. And here is where the movie really missed the mark. The 79's were so bizarre that Wolverine could have had many humorous clashes with the culture. (Did you ever see I love the 70's?) But all they did was play Roberta Flack on the radio - a missed opportunity to save the movie.Oh yes - both Magneto and Dr. Charles Xavier (Cougat?) send him back to stop Mystique. Naturally one of his biggest challenges will be to convince the young Erik (Magneto) and Xavier - in the past - to help Wolverine stop Mystique. They say they have not matured their powers yet (in the past), but then display them in all their glory later (later in the past)- oops another messy plot deal.So Wolverine stumbles around in 1973 - and the final scene (the assassination of the dwarf) climaxes with (young) Magneto pulling a stadium (Redskins Stadium? - oops politically insensitive name - sorry) from the ground and surrounding the White House with it. Then Magneto pulls a black box containing the President and his staff (+ the dwarf) from under the Oval Office - rips the door off - and Richard Nixon comes forward to be sacrificed instead of the rest of mankind. What? Also it is revealed that JFK was a mutant (I always knew there was something strange about that guy.)And the actor playing Richard Nixon looked more like Lady Bird Johnson than Nixon!! They could have just put one of those Nixon Halloween masks on the actor and been more convincing.The best line in the movie was almost at the end when one of the characters looks up and says ""What in the hell is going on?"" Too bad they did not get a Vince Lombardi look-alike for that line..Now, I read some of the reviews which hysterically gushed over the movie: ""Best X-Men yet!"" (Maybe they did not see any of the other movies.) This just shows that the world is full of different people with different tastes and desires. Believe it or not, there are some people who liked 3 Days to Kill!! (well not really, I was just trying to be charitable.)Ooh - one other good thing - at the beginning one of the mutants displayed his unique power - the power to make people puke on demand - pretty cool - pretty good power. How much can you really do to someone when you are puking?I didn't hate it, I was just sad that the X-Men series had fallen to this depth.I'm sure we will see more of the X-Men - I'm just not sure I am up to any more of this. My apologies for jinxing this one.","

"ohashmawi","29 May 2014","I wasn't really sure about this movie, I mean time travel is something that can screw movies real good, and there were probably going to be a bunch of continuity errors, but man was I wrong (at least partially). X- Men: Days of Future Past is absolutely badass! It is a really awesome movie, despite the continuity stuff, this film was so riveting, action- packed and funny that you don't even care about the coherency with the other films, because this one is probably the best one. The acting in X-Men DOFP is really good, everyone does a great job, there isn't a false note anywhere in the movie. In terms of the main characters, Hugh Jackman is always great as Wolverine, I don't really need to talk about him too much, because he is awesome every time. But there's something in this movie that I really liked, we see Wolverine as a more human character, he doesn't go nuts as much as he usually does, and I thought it was pretty cool to see him in a different light. James McAvoy was just incredible! I loved how they humanized his character, when Patrick Stewart plays him, you can't really relate to him, because he's the know-it-all mentor, in First Class too, but in this movie he at an all-time low in life, he's so sad, cynical, and human, really great acting. Michael Fassbender is also really good, he may be the bad guy, but there's this one scene where, despite him being a dick(god, he is such a prick in this movie) you can understand where he's coming from, watching him and Charles interact is really interesting. Jennifer Lawrence is also always incredible, she still has that human element she had in First Class, but she's way more badass here. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and the other old-school X-Men are really cool, (Old Magneto had a really badass scene during the final act in the future, it just made me scream in joy), but the new additions are awesome as well, I particularly liked Blink and Bishop, their powers made for some INCREDIBLE fight scenes. But someone who absolutely blew me away was Evan Peters as Quicksilver. He is the coolest character in the movie, easily, I feel so bad that I was on the band wagon that thought he looked really bad, but he is so awesome! The scene where he demonstrates his powers with the cops is one of the best scenes I've seen, ever. He was such a funny and interesting character. Peter Dinklage is also very good in this movie, I just didn't get his character's reason for hating mutants so much, which is kind of big, but I forgave that one. And there's a point where you think, ""With such a big cast, can I really care about all of the characters? Yes you can! You care about every single one of the X-Men! Even the ones who don't appear that much like Storm and Iceman, they aren't all developed though, but that's okay, because they're just supporting characters.This film is so exciting, it is on from the opening credits which are awesome (hearing the original X-Men theme again was just indescribable), until the also awesome post-credits scene, even when the characters are just talking is interesting. The action is amazing, again the scene with Quicksilver is incredible, but the final act, the one in the future is so awesome! The cinematography, directing, 3D are all top- notch in this film. The special effects here are absolutely incredible, all technical aspects are as well. The directing by Bryan Singer is fantastic, there's this one scene with Mystique, where a person is filming her with a really old 70s camera, and the footage from the camera is played in the middle of the scene, those shots were fantastic! They added such a realistic feeling to the scene, that was a great idea.The writing in this movie is very good, they made the time travel concept plausible (for this movie), they kept it simple. And what they did with the ending was awesome! You could say they kind of fixed some mistakes of other X-Men films. The story is really great, it's a great mixture between the comic story and something new that they created, it works really well. This movie handles its multitude of characters by making them important to one of the central story arcs, and it's great! However there were some flaws, I'm talking about the continuity errors, most of them couldn't be avoided of course, but there was one that really stuck out, and I didn't understand the reason for it, it was Wolverine's Adamantium claws (in the future/present), and this is something that's incoherent with the ending of another X-Men film. What they did there could have been changed, to me there was no logical explanation for his Adamantium claws. And that was my biggest flaw with the film. Another flaw was that the final act in the past was a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the film's fights, it didn't have the intended effect on me, it did not feel like there was a lot at stake, don't know why, but it just didn't. And those were my only flaws.This film is really fun, I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was an intense, funny, action-packed and absolutely entertaining X-Men adventure. Days of Future Past is really awesome, it masterfully concludes the X-Men franchise revival mission, which started with First Class, continued with The Wolverine, and ended with X-Men: Days of Future Past. I recommend this movie.","

This is a movie that proves superhero movies are not just some cringe garbage for kids such as fantastic for. This is much more then that. It makes you feel the emotion and suspense that is going on and tho the main villains are robots and lack emotion, they still manage to strike fear and emotion when on screen. The bad reviews are people that can't take this seriously because the idea is to ""childish"". Just watch it and see for yourself.","

"turdbadge","12 October 2014","It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of X-Men: Days of Future Past: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'demon warrior' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'demon warriors' that are out there.There's some English religious mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed – a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of X-MEN, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Bryan Singer needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense.","

"Al_The_Strange","14 June 2014","It's been fourteen years since the X-Men first hit the big screen, setting the trend for a whole monsoon of comic-book movies. Counting the two stand-alone Wolverine movies, Days of Future Past is the seventh in the series. The X-Men have had so many ups and downs over the years that it's easily become the most convoluted franchise since the original Planet of the Apes. This film fulfills the same role as Escape from Planet of the Apes, redirecting the story arcs to rectify past mistakes and set the path for a bold, promising future.Days of Future Past takes after First Class primarily, but there are vague connections to the other movies. Unlike the previous films, this one doesn't have the same light-spirited kick-butt feel. If anything, it starts off looking like The Terminator, swapping out T-800s for Sentinels, with Wolverine standing in for the T-101, Mystique fulfilling the role of Sarah Connor, and Trask standing in for Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne. However, it never comes off as a rip-off; it's still X-Men to the core. The bleak future we see in the film's opening has always been in the cards, representing the apex of the ongoing conflict between men and mutants; the set-up is laid out very quickly, before launching a double-barreled narrative in both the past and the future with substantial stakes and suspense.In lesser hands, this could have become a hokey affair (and chances are that the most critical of viewers could nitpick plot inconsistencies, especially when time travel is involved). However, this is easily the most mature film of the series, thanks not only to the complex plot dynamics that unfold with this unique premise, but also because of the characters. Their motivations and relationships are as strong as ever, and drives the story into different directions. Charles Xavier in particular emerges as the heart and soul of the whole film, driving numerous conflicts among other characters and within himself that underscores key themes concerning progress, destiny, and overcoming adversity of any kind. A lot of the lesser characters get sidelined, but Wolverine, Mystique, Magneto, and Beast get plenty of screen time.Fortunately, as the plot unfolds, it does pull out a satisfying amount of action and spectacle. It's never overblown or overwhelming, and it's not just a bunch of things blowing up just because; it's nicely-balanced action that builds logically from the story. Scenes in the future show some pretty harrowing super-powered fights, while the rest of the film dishes out a lot of cool fights (including one crazy scene entirely in slow-motion, thanks to one super-fast mutant). It all builds up to a double-whammy climax, which not only ramps up the carnage, but also draws out the suspense.This film features pretty good photography. Editing is fine, although it seemed like there were a lot of scenes in the beginning where a character starts to talk, but then the camera cuts away, and it came off as a little weird, as if the movie didn't want to show you who was talking. Acting is great across the board; James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart both excel as Charles Xavier, while Michael Fassbender continues to dominate as the younger Magneto (unfortunately, I felt Ian McKellen wasn't given enough to do here). It was also great to watch Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, and Peter Dinklage. Writing is good, especially in the way it addresses the continuity of the series and bridges the gaps it needs to, while keeping things fresh and crafting a quality story with quality dialogue. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is alright (you can expect to hear a little bit of a reprise of the theme from the first two movies).Days of Future Past is a movie about saving the future, not only in the movie, but also for the franchise as a whole. Despite certain contrivances, it is a highly nuanced story that rectifies some of the low points of the series. It genuinely kept me interested to see where it was all going. Even after the movie, it kept me interested, leaving just enough questions wide open to leave me wanting more. Best of all, the film accomplishes all this using plot and character more than special effects. So long as you've freshened up on the events of First Class, this film is highly recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good <> Story: Very Good <> Film: Very Good)","

"lesleyharris30","14 June 2014","X-Men: Days of Future Past is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast and characters. I would say this movie is by far the best X-Men in the series yet, it brings the original cast with the prequels with the element of time travel, which is something I always love in films, it's a complicated and well structured storyline that you need to keep following or you'll get lost. The only aspect of this film that left me disappointed was that the young and older members don't really end up meeting, Hugh Jackman meets them all and there is a scene between James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart, but other than that no other young X-Men meets their older self, I was really hoping to see Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen, that would have brought a big smile to my face, but sadly that never comes around. The cast is fantastic and very powerful here and the special effects are out of this world, there are many beautiful action and fighting sequences that are simply beautiful, it's great to see Bryan Singer back at the directors chair, he really understands this franchise and I think he is one of the only people who could give a story as complicated as this justice and make it as straightforward as possible for audiences, particularly Quicksilver's scenes which looked very hard to film, but he did a stellar job and it is an absolute delight to watch. Action packed and will keep you at the edge of your seat, fans of X-Men will not be disappointed and I would recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Wolverine travels back in time and teams up with Charles Xavier, Magneto and Beast in order to stop Mystique from causing an event that has a huge effect on the future of mutants.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman","

"estebangonzalez10","24 May 2014","""Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?""I don't know if I have the right words to explain how much fun this seventh film in the X-Men franchise truly is. Matthew Vaughn revived this franchise in First Class by taking us to the past and giving the film a much more emotionally dramatic tone, focusing on the relationship between Charles and Erik. The greatest thing about that film was the cast he was able to assemble with James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hoult leading the pack. At first I didn't know quite what to expect when I heard Vaughn was stepping down and leaving Days of Future Past in Bryan Singer's hands. On the one hand he was responsible for the success of the first two X-Men films, but on the other hand I was let down with Superman Returns. I guess I kind of forgot this man was responsible for the superhero genre revival (contrary to popular belief, it was him with the first X-Men film not Sam Raimi with SpiderMan which came out two years later) that has dominated movie screens for the past decade and a half. Singer hasn't lost his touch and he delivers an exhilarating and entertaining film worthy of being a blockbuster summer hit. It has everything you want from a blockbuster movie: fantastic visuals, great action sequences, a perfect ensemble cast, and a story that is both fun and emotionally engaging. I don't just want cool visuals and nice actions sequences, I want to be engaged with the characters and care for them, and that is what Singer pulls off beautifully with Days of Future Past. Add the wonderful performances from Fassbender, McAvoy, Lawrence, Stewart, Jackman, and a wonderful scene with Evan Peters as Quicksilver and you have a perfect movie. This might just be my favorite superhero film after The Dark Knight due to the fact that the cast is amazing and that Singer managed to perfectly blend the best aspects of the earlier films in the franchise with the new elements Vaughn brought to the reboot. It is hard to imagine how after 7 films, Days of Future Past manages to remain so fresh and keep the audience so emotionally invested in these characters. As we reach the halfway point of the year, I must say this is the best film of 2014 so far.Based on the Days of Future Past comic book story arc written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the screenplay was adapted by Simon Kinberg. Set in an apocalyptic future, the few surviving mutants are struggling to fight together against sentinels created by humans to hunt them down. The few surviving mutants we see fighting in the first scene are Colossus, Sunspot, Bishop, Iceman, Warpath, Blink, and Kitty Pryde. There isn't much they can do against these sentinels that adapt and absorb their powers. Several mutants are killed during the attack, but then all of a sudden they disappear as we discover Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) mutation has evolved in such a way that she can send someone's consciousness back through time. By doing so they were able to send Bishop a few minutes back in time and warn them about the sentinel attack, thus altering the recent timeline and staying alive. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) know that the mutants are facing extinction and that in order to be saved they must return to the past and undo something Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) did in 1973. Along with Charles and Magneto, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) arrive to the place where the rest of the mutants are hiding out. Since Wolverine is the only one who doesn't age and who can fully recover, they decide he is the only one fit to return to the past and stop Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the sentinel program. His murder would only fuel human's hate towards mutants and lead them to perfecting his work through experimentation with Mystique's unique DNA. Once back in the past, Logan must reach out to Charles (James McAvoy) and Erick (Michael Fassbender) and unite them in order to stop Mystique from achieving her goal and thus saving their future. Time traveling can be a difficult and tricky feat to pull off, but by using a similar approach to other films such as The Terminator, Singer manages to turn it into a quite simple premise. He merges both timelines perfectly in a satisfactory way. The film feels genuine thanks to some wonderful performances, strong character development, excellent pacing, and the emotional risks that are involved. In a way, I felt like Days of Future Past followed the steps of its predecessor and fixed a lot of the problems audiences had with The Last Stand, thus reinvigorating the franchise without having to reboot it. The film is inventive, original, and there are plenty of surprises. I loved every moment Fassbender was on screen as he absolutely dominates every dramatic moment. Jackman's Wolverine was always my favorite character in the X-Men franchise, and he is fantastic, but this time he has a lot of help from the rest of the cast. McAvoy also adds a lot to the emotional dramatic effect of the film on the viewer. The scene he is confronted by his future self (Stewart) is impressive. His character and Fassbender's are complete opposites despite the fact that they truly respect and care for each other. Lawrence's Mystique seems to be at the center of their struggle. All these elements combined with Singer's breathtaking visuals turn what could've been just another conventional superhero film into an epic one. Singer also knows how to balance action with dramatic moments along with some comedic ones.","

"dimitris-kara","26 May 2014","It's difficult to talk about all the good things in this movie. Magnificent actors ,a story so great that no matter how difficult it was for Bryan Singer to deliver , in the end the satisfaction was there. No pointless action was also a plus for my review . I always wanted to see the depth of the story , the emotions of the characters , and this movie's got it all . Also bear in mind that this movie was also a try to fix the problems that the latest x-movies had created. Yet that is also done in the end . Another thing is that Hugh Jackman not only once again proves how he can perfectly perform the same role in a different mode ,since wolverine is more like a mentor in this one , but also how he can still be in 100% body shape for years in success. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen bring their experience in and a combination with Fassbender's and Mcavoy's great performances is a boost . Now i can't wait for the next one .","

"SunSg","24 May 2014","I went to watch the movie looking for a action movie and what I got was a drama....!!! Definitely not worth watching in 3D. So do calibrate your expectations before you book this show. The movie starts off and it had me glued .... For a moment I thought it was Xmen combined with the Matrix , the attack on Xmen is almost in similar manner and by similar threats - sentinels, and same dialog ( ""they are coming"" , ""they found us "") but that's the limit of similarity . The action sequence was a bit boring or rather More confusing then exciting. The seniors come in after that and then it enters the drama mode and becomes a drag. The scenes with Quicksilver brings some excitement but a short lived one - Worth watching. By the climax magneto comes in action, makes things interesting for a while, but again doesn't get his normal exposure, what one would be used to seeing. Halle Barry / storm almost non existent in the whole movie, so don't expect to see her much. Off the female Xmen only Raven gets a good footage, but in most of it she is shown as the naive little girl... All in all I would say not that great to talk about and the 2 hrs + duration doesn't help too..... :-( .","

"tenlegdragon","21 May 2014","I think this is the movie where I fully disassociate myself from the Xmen franchise. Prof X logic has always been spotty, but I can't make heads or tales of it in a situation where the entire population of the world is being killed by Sentinels.When you're facing extinction I think it's time to cut the Ghandi crap and get real. But his delusions are spreading instead to even the ""bad"" guys, which makes no sense.Plus, I'm not the hugest J-Law fan in the world and this was just a little too Mystique centric for me. I like her in small doses. Just cause it's J-Law acting the part doesn't mean the story has to revolve around her. #fail","

"aharmas","29 May 2014","Watching a movie can be plenty of fun. Seeing a good movie in a movie theater is an experience that is hard to beat, and having the opportunity to see a great film turn into a classic in front of your eyes is a pleasure that it is hard to match, and that is the case with this chapter in X-Men saga. It's an almost perfect film, a thrill to sit through, a perfect blend of technical and good writing. This film proves that quality is not equal to classical drama, but something that occurs when you have some very talented people working together and giving you the best they can.For starters, that marvelous cast, all of them in a perfect ensemble. Some taking care of the philosophy and the ""heavy"" duty stuff that gives X-Men its soul. Here we have Magneto and Xavier struggling with a love affair and the future of their kind. Two beings who know they must find a way to walk the thin line that could turn them into monsters and ruin humanity's chances of survival. Then there is the team that they need to support and protect, and who can help maintain their safety on Earth. It pays to hire some of the best: Berry, Jackman, Fassbender, and a list that is too long to mention.Then we have one amazing piece of writing, weaving two time periods into a very tight story line that has the very difficult issue of time travel explored and played with in a very exciting manner. Bodies drops and destinies change in front of our eyes for better or worse. Nothing is simple, as we can see when Xavier and Magneto meet again, so to speak. Then there are those moments when all of these people are in the middle of a confrontation with their mortality, and we can see that we are really not that different from each other. Jackman just keeps getting better and better at making us forget how strong the soul of his character is. We know all of them struggle with the duality of their nature, but Wolverine makes it easier to understand that pain, and it doesn't hurt that he is very good at displaying his powers in action.My favorite part of the movie deals with its heart, and this is pretty much left in the hands of Lawrence, who has grown so much in front of our eyes in the last few years. She has fire in her performance, and we can see the passion, the determination, and the fear when trying to choose when it's o.k. to listen. I wonder about the choreography of her fights, and if she's involved, I am in awe.The story is basic. Wolverine must go back in time (his essence) anyway, and he has to find a way to stop a series of events to save both humans and mutants from a fate worse than death and/or death itself. The introductory scenes dazzle, as we see our heroes working in perfect unison trying to escape those machines that have been created in the past and now are exterminating every mutant they encounter. They are the perfect killing machines, and it's ironic that their source of power has originated from a mutant, too. In the beginning, things look pretty bad for everyone involved.The ride gets more exciting, as the trip to the past begins, and we are treated to another of the highlights of this fantastic piece of cinema, as we see that it takes an action film to really bring out some of the best in craftmanship. We see sets that blow our minds as we are literally, with the help of 3D and much creative talent to the 70's. ""American Hustle"" was praised to heaven and had very little to offer. This film has huge sets, dazzling amounts of costumes, props to satisfy the biggest of cynics. Cars, drinks, furniture, hairdos, all perfectly integrated and propelling the story forward, without trying to be call attention to themselves by being too clever. Everything has a function here, and it's perfectly performed.In the end, there's only one small disappointment here, and it is the fact that it will be very difficult to match this film. Earlier in 2014, ""Captain America II"" gave us a taste of what could be done when focus is regained, and this ""X-Men"" entry proves that practice makes perfect, and that careful planning and execution can indeed result in miracles. I know they only give 10 stars here, but I could probably go for an even dozen.","

"MLDinTN","18 April 2015","I don't like sci-fi films when the plot gets too confusing and that was the case here. It starts out in present time, and the mutants are under attack from these human built robots, but by using time travel are able to warn there present selves when its time to leave a current location. Already sounds confusing.Anyways, the mutants decide to take a last stand and want to prevent these robots from ever existing. So Logan is sent back in time to stop Raven from killing this guy Trask, whom is leading the research to build these robots. So Logan, must get Xavier, Magneto, and the Beast to believe him. And of course, once out, Magneto doesn't stay good for long. And they are trying to prevent all this from happening during the President's speech.FINAL VERDICT: Too much stuff that happens this is hard to follow, it is so hard for a movie to do time travel right because there are so many what ifs. And I thought it just got lose in the convoluted plot. Definitely not as good as the first X-men movies.","

"ttron2000","22 May 2014","that's right. i can't believe I'm saying this, nor did i think it was possible, but the X-Men film series is back to being just as rich as its 2000 inception and its undeniably stronger 2003 sequel that brought warmth to the hearts of many a comic book dork on this planet. indeed, the films have experienced a massive creative downfall since director Bryan Singer's exit at the 3rd movie (which i hated) and while things looked promising with Matthew Vaughn's under-appreciated X-Men First Class, Singer's return has brought back the greatness of a terrific X-Men film. X-Men Days of Future Past may seem like an exercise in damage control (Singer's been clear about his regret in leaving the franchise), but that wasn't an issue while watching this intriguing chapter that's worth every second of a fan boy's attention. the year is 2023 and Earth is now a decimated wasteland, dominated by the destructive Sentinels, machines initially meant for searching out and killing mutants, but over time have overridden their programming and gone about the total extermination of everybody, human or mutant. idealistic telepath Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and hateful cynic/metal manipulator Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) unite once again as allies to fight this robotic evil in hopes of survival, but accompanied with only a scattered handful of fellow mutants, their futile efforts to battle these endless (not to mention adaptable and unstoppable) swarms of Sentinels force them to resort to a shaky form of mind-manipulation/time-jumping, controlled by Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page). this method is all but exhausted as they fear it won't be long before they're completely overrun. they're last move is to send the consciousness of Logan (Hugh Jackman), the ageless, regenerating Wolverine himself, 50 years into the past to link up with his body in 1973. this Hail Mary pass is meant to prevent the events leading up to the Sentinels creation. this means finding longtime friends/foes Xavier and Lehnsherr in a time where both men were at their most depressive states and when their relationship was never more bitter. then there's locating the vengeful shape-shifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who's not only a big reason for Xavier and Lehnsherr's animosity, but an indirect player in the Sentinels's technological advancement. Logan, usually the most efficient of brawlers in Xavier's band of gifted badasses, is now the man who has to keep it all together, whether that means recruiting the troops, such as the super-fast smartass Quicksilver (Evan Peters) or arranging a prison breakout (beneath the Pentagon of all places), he only has so much time to complete his mission before the Sentinels of the future close in on Kitty and end it all right there. i already feel I've said too much, but wow, there's more. so much more. the movie is tightly-structured, beautifully shot, marvelously performed, and stands so well on its own, long forgotten are the excruciating X-Men 3 or the abysmal X-Men Origins (which Singer has shamelessly, hilariously, and wisely ignored ever existed). not all the discrepancies from former films are completely rectified, but after an opening battle (which includes the return of Halle Berry's Storm and Shawn Ashmore's Iceman as well as newcomers Omar Sy as Bishop and Fan Bingbing as Blink), you won't care. the ride is too great and the story too involving. what's more is that this is hands-down the best acted X-Men film to date. Jackman has never half-assed a performance in his whole career and this is no exception. as the anchor holding both past and future ships steady, the man knows this character better than anyone and even in the weakest of Wolverine installments, he just doesn't know how to suck...ever. the always luminous Lawrence doesn't just bring the same gravitas to Mystique as she did in First Class, but shatters through every level, whether it be emotional or athletic. Stewart, McKellen, Sy (who's very underused), and the always excellent Peter Dinklage as Sentinel designer and chief villain Bolivar Trask are flawless in their supporting roles. but it's Fassbender and especially MacAvoy who steal the show. these two master craftsmen not only stand well on their own, but their unique and toxic interaction is enough to make even the blandest of material watchable and here's a movie where every word is great. i couldn't stop myself from admitting that if the whole movie had just been the two of them sparring, i would've been okay with that. i was happy with everyone in the movie except Peters, who even with having limited screen time and an action sequence that brought the crowd to loud cheers, seemed too obnoxious to like. i may be alone on that, but that's on me. to say anything more would be pushing it, except to say you should be prepared for a fantastic story with a kickass finale and the very welcome appearances of some great cameos. believe me when i say that my doubts on this movie were heavy and i feared the worst without any hope for the best and this is the one case where all my doubts have been completely crushed, very much to my deep pleasure. this was a huge step in the right direction and if Singer was haunted by past mistakes, he's done right so far in his attempts to correct them. X-Men fans should see this and i seriously doubt many will be disappointed. i'm already excited to see it again. BRAVO!!!","

"jboothmillard","31 May 2014","The first film was good, the second was fantastic, the third was disappointing, as was prequel Origins: Wolverine, prequel First Class was brilliant, and The Wolverine was a good warm up for this next instalment in the Marvel X-Men franchise, from director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns, Valkyrie). Basically in a dystopian future, mutants and humans are being exterminated by robots known as Sentinels, who have powers and strength gained from mutant genes, Kitty Pryde (Inception's Ellen Page) and a small band of mutants, including Bobby Drake aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), have evaded the robots and are taking cover in a China monastery. Her group meet with Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Ororo Munroe aka Storm (Halle Berry) and discuss the past, in 1973 Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) murdered Dr. Bolivar Trask (Game of Throne's Peter Dinklage), designer of the Sentinels, who used Mystique's genes to engineer the indestructible robots. The only way to stop the mutant and human destruction is to send someone back to 1973 and stop Mystique from killing Trask, Logan is the only one strong enough to stand the strain of his consciousness being transported to the past, he is told by Professor Xavier that he should find the younger versions of himself and Magneto for assistance. Logan wakes up in 1973, goes to the X-Mansion, there he meets younger Hank McCoy aka Beast (Skins' Nicholas Hoult), and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), a broken man able to walk with a serum created by McCoy, but using it suppresses his telepathic powers, most teachers and students of the Institute for Gifted Youngsters are fighting the Vietnam War, the school is closed. Logan explains his mission, but Magento aka Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is in a strong prison cell beneath the Pentagon, accused of killing President John F. Kennedy, eventually Logan persuades Xavier to free him, they get help from super fast mutant Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Evan Peters). Meanwhile Trask is in Washington D.C. unsuccessfully campaigning his the Sentinel program to Congress, in Saigon meanwhile Mystique investigates him, discovering his capturing and experimenting on mutants, Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Wolverine track her down to Paris, where Americans and Vietnamese are negotiating to end the Vietnam War. Mystique is disguised as a general, Trask is attempting to sell the Sentinel technology to the Communists, but Mystique is stopped by the four mutants before she can kill him, Magneto tries to kill her to end it all, she is only wounded and disappears, the fight is taken outside where onlookers and cameras see them, and during it Logan recognises a young Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman), responsible in the future for his torture, this momentarily causes his body discomfort in his future body. President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) decides to approve Trask's Sentinel program, with worldwide panic massing at the knowledge of mutants, a blood sample from Mystique was found on the ground, this is key to the Sentinels powers, an unveiling for them will happen in Washington D.C., but the prototypes have been intercepted by Magneto, with their frames laces with steel. Xavier is convinced that the only way to locate Mystique is to stop taking his serum and use his telepathic powers, but he will at the same time lose his ability to walk, he regains his powers and struggles at first with all the voices in his head, but seeing the future in Wolverine's head, and speaking to his future self, he is inspired to save the world and make peace between the humans and mutants, and uses Cerebro to track down Mystique. The Sentinels are unveiled by Nixon on the White House lawn, but Magnto raises the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and drops it as a barricade around the Presidential building, while the robots attack the crowd the President and Trask are taken down to a safe room, with a disguised Mystique. Xavier, Wolverine and Beast try to stop Magneto, Wolverine is impaled by rebars and launched into the Potomac River, the safe room is pulled out of the ground by Magneto, he is about to kill what he thinks is Nixon, but it is in fact disguised Mystique who reveals herself and shoots him, at the same time as these events happening the Sentinels in the future have tracked the mutants down and are getting close, even killing most of the mutants. In 1973, Xavier explains what will happen if Mystique does kill Trask, and eventually she drops her gun, this in the future causes all events to disappear as the past has been changed, the Sentinel program is cancelled and Trask is arrested for selling military secrets, and Magneto is to be hunted down the dystopian future is averted, and Logan was rescued from the river by Mystique disguised as Stryker. In the end Logan wakes up in the present day at Xavier's school, and walking around he is happy to see recognisable mutant friends alive and well, including Iceman, Marie D'Ancanto aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), Peter Rasputin aka Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Kitty, Beast (Kelsey Grammar) and Storm, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Scott Summers aka Cyclops (James Marsden) and of course older Xavier. Also starring Bingbing Fan as Blink, Omar Sy as Bishop, Twilight's Booboo Stewart as Warpath, Adan Canto as Sunspot, Lucas Till as Havok, Evan Jonigkeit as Toad, Godzilla's Michael Lerner as Senator Brickman and Morgan Lily as Young Raven. fantasy action adventure. The cast all remain great in their recognisable roles, and the story combining future and past is clever and well constructed, but what really propelled this blockbuster was the outstanding special effects, for the fantastic mutant powers and destructive forces, and the fast moving fight and chase sequences, it really is one of the finest of the franchise, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!","

"sakeebshahid","14 June 2014","The plot is as complicated as the title itself, but it's done so masterfully that there's no scope for complaints.The acting is superb, and the chemistry between the cast members is noteworthy. It grips you instantly from the get-go with an elaborately orchestrated action sequence, and keeps you on the hook till the very end.Even when there's not much going on-screen, the emotional intensity feels very real and palatable. The introduction of Quicksilver couldn't be any better. He steals every scene that he's in, and makes vital contributions whenever he's needed. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine. Only this time he shows his depth of the character in a more vulnerable and experienced way.There is a couple of surprises throughout the film, and the inclusion of humor every now and then- makes the movie worth every penny!The conflict of ideologies between the Professor and Magneto is impartially depicted. And the dark past of a few major characters is carefully handled.Overall, a solid A+. And a must-see film of 2014.","

"anirudh-bhatnagar","31 May 2014","It was nice to see some of the older caste back, you get a warm fuzzy feeling at the end. Time travel stories can be a bit convoluted but this was largely(not entirely) coherent. New mutants introduced to non comics readers were cool and 3d was quite decent. Acting was well done. Is it X-ceptional? Definitely not. The movie made very little sense to me having seen all of the previous movies. There were a lot of things that should not be happening with respect to continuity. There were times I felt script writers completely squandered the potential. Maybe it was set in alternate verse, but that is more DC than Marvel. Many questions that popped in mind that were not answered at all. Wolverine getting back his adamantium claw? Xavier alive and well in same body? Xavier and magneto came to wolverine in the past for help in the airport? How was that done when apart from wolverine, no one else can travel back more than a few weeks? The ability to transfer consciousness back in time, how does that work is never explained fully. How does raven/mystique know where to look for Wolverine at the end? Will wolverine no longer have adamantium bones and claws? Questions aside, slightly above average movie that gives a sense of nostalgia making you look beyond its shortcomings.","

Personally, I've seen enough of Jennifer Lawrence. For my taste, she's over rated and over exposed and I much preferred Rebecca Romijn in the Mystique role. I was disappointed in much the same way as the replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the Batman franchise. Ellen Page annoys me. I must have missed something ... how did Dr. X come back from the dead ? Wolverine is starting to show some grey FINALLY ... isn't he a couple hundred years old ? but he looks more ripped than he has in years! I wouldn't recommend not seeing it, but it fell FAR short of my expectations. Big $14. disappointment.","

"CubsandCulture","3 February 2021","The film would be a lot more engaging if it wasn't in a much larger series. The storyline uses an interesting take on time travel and the writing keeps the mechanics mostly clear and clean. Likewise, Singer's direction keeps the proceedings grand and satisfying with inventive scenes and period detail. But fundamentally this film is a soft-reboot of the series that mainly exists to erase X-Men 3 and other media properties the fans were not fond of. In short, it is fan service.","

"thealphakeno","21 May 2014","X-men: Days of Future Past is the newest installment of the X-men series, occurring after the events of both X-men: First Class and The Wolverine. As a fan, I'm so pump to see the film but before they finished the whole thing, there's been a lot of changes as they film it, which made me, think twice on the outcome of the whole film.It was a perfect film with 95% of rating. A truly masterpiece with lots of actions and amazing effects. There are just some flaws that I couldn't ignore as a fan.First of all was the removing of Anna Paquin's character Rogue. She is the main reason I really wanted to see the film. But when they cut her major scene and put her as a cameo, it really breaks my heart. She appeared in the film for 3 seconds. She smiled and walks away with Iceman. THAT'S ALL. While on the other hand, Jean Grey and Scott appears to and has a minimum of 2 minutes with dialogue in the film. In my part, it was unfair. Two of them died in the previous movie. Rogue survived and has only one scene but yet they ditch her.Second was the explanation on how Professor X survives/reborn after his death on X-men: The Last Stand. I didn't notice if they explained it but I'm pretty sure there is no exact explanation about it. Third and last was the explanation on how Kitty gains time travelling power? I'm going to buy it if it's Rogue become the main facilitator of the time travel. But Kitty? Phasing is not related to Time travelling. Furthermore, I enjoy the film. 2 hours is not enough for me. Blink's portals are awesome!; Sunspot's power works well with the effects, just too bright like the sun and not darker like in comics; and Warpath, trust me, no one noticed he could fly but more like fighter, but still amazing. I have lots of question that needs to be explained through deleted scenes and interviews but moreover, I can assure you that you will enjoy the movie from start to finish.",NA
"callanvass","8 June 2014","After being somewhat disappointed with X-Men: First Class, my expectations for this movie were normal. I expected an entertaining movie, but nothing more. I didn't expect such an ambitious and emotional installment. Right from the outset, I knew I was in for a wild ride, I just had that feeling. My gut instinct doesn't usually lie and it didn't this time around. Before I praise this movie thoroughly, I'll get one flaw out-of-the-way. If you're a huge X-Men fan, I don't recommend that you watch all the movies before this one. The continuity errors will drive you crazy. If you manage to brush that aside and block it out, more than likely you'll have a blast with this movie. With this sequel, everybody has so much more to lose. The stakes definitely feel way higher than before and I felt it emotionally. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere in the future is appropriately grim and extremely well done. I was also impressed with how they made 1973 look. I felt it mirrored the time period precisely. If you're craving action, this movie won't disappoint you. It's filled with tons of action for all the adrenaline junkies out there. Another thing I really liked was the presence of mutant killing machines. It made the odds seem insurmountable for the gang. The performances are excellent. Hugh Jackman is awesome as always. It was great to see Patrick Stewart in the franchise again. McAvoy & Fassbender are even more comfortable in their roles this time around. They were great as young Charles & Erik respectively. I felt they played off one another perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Mystique. Ian McKellen doesn't have as much to do, but it was nice to see him play a good guy. Halle Berry is completely wasted as Storm. She barely has any dialog and her screen time isn't that great either. Peter Dinklage added an interesting element to his part. Anna Paquin has a brief scene near the end. Page, Hoult, and Ashmore do what they have to do well. I won't spoil it, but there is a couple of cameo's at the end of the movie that made me grin. X-Men fans will definitely be pleased with the cameos. I liked the way they ended the movie. They tacked on a happy ending, but made sure it wasn't too contrived. X-Men: Apocalypse is due next for this franchise. It will be interesting to see what direction they take. I was floored by this movie and I didn't expect to be. Not only is it filled with breathtaking action, it manages to be successfully ambitious at the same time. I really don't see how you can dislike this movie. It has a bit of everything and it's a must see! I'm glad I saw this in the theater9.3/10",NA
"Brettyboy007","7 July 2014","When I heard X-Men: Days of Future Past was going to feature Sentinels for the first time in the franchise, I was ecstatic. I love sentinels. I grew up reading the X-Men comics and seeing these behemoths come to life on the comic pages. And I must admit, I was very satisfied with the way they looked. I went to see this with my friend and he was excited about them too.Don't get me wrong by the vote. I love X-Men. I've seen every one of them except for The Wolverine. The whole series has been very well done for a Marvel comic. The plot could be hard for some people to get but basically in a nutshell: It is the future and sentinels have hunted down all mutants and so the group sends Wolverine back to 1973 to stop an event that will unleash the sentinels and cause hell for mutants worldwide. Hugh Jackman did an excellent job as Wolverine. We get introduced to a couple new characters such as Bolivar Trask, and Quicksilver among other mutants.I won't say anymore about the plot, but it is a intense ride throughout the whole movie.Now on to the only reason this movie deserves a C rating: The ending. I HATED it. I mean it with capital letters. I won't spoil it, but I will say the ending could leave a lot of you upset like me. I found out later on the reason why the ending was the way it was, and just...damn. Why Bryan Singer? Why?I don't understand why this is in IMDb's top 250.P.S. There is a scene in the ending credits.",NA
"TheNineOrders","22 May 2014","Brian Singer has done nothing but stomp on the source material he claims to love so much. I have no idea were fan-boys get to idolize him so much. I have tried to visualize this franchise as a parallel universe (there are so many of those in the comics) but still I can't stand how lame the characters come through. X-men: days of future past is no different.Plot: Instead of ripping the entire film, I am going to present a simple thought on the premise of the movie that will give you an insight on how badly people want to love this movie despite it's blatantly glaring flaws. The premise of this plot states that Xavier can transport a consciousness back in time to the younger self of the individual. It also claims that the strongest telepath on Earth (Jean Grey is dead remember) is too weak to survive the journey. They come to the conclusion that Logan is the perfect candidate to travel due to his healing abilities. Wait...what? Why is a healing ability a factor to the equation when Xavier is transporting a consciousness? No physical body is traveling otherwise there would have been two Wolverines in the film (which would have made for a far more interesting film with funnier moments than the ones they deliver through Quicksilver). Kitty Pride plays a part in the time traveling scheme again establishing that a physical body is being transported yet is just a consciousness. This building block alone makes the entire structure fall flat on its face. That it is entertaining, sure why not, but to say it is the best X- men movie is taking it to far. We are yet to see a decent X-men movie to date. The closest Mr Singer has been to a source material and mythology was with Superman Returns and everyone cra*+^# on that one (to me that movie is the best Singer has offered). One more thing, the fact that Jennifer Lawrence takes up so much of the screen time (due to her fame with the much crappier Hunger Games) let's me know the audience the producers were meaning to capture with this one.Verdict: You might enjoy the visuals and the action. Quicksilver will deliver the funniest moments in the film. Peter Dinklage was a waste of a great actor. Brian Singer continues to stomp on the rich and vast source material to create his own versions of characters he says to love as if all his intention is to take the glory that rightfully belongs to Stan Lee. I'd personally wait for it to show on your premium movie channels.",NA
"Anurag-Shetty","25 May 2014","X-Men: Days of Future Past continues with the adventures of the X-Men. 2023, a dark & hopeless future. Most of the mutants & humans have been wiped out by the Sentinels. Sentinels are dangerous robots that can adapt to any mutant's powers, which make them far more superior. The remaining mutants led by Professor X(Patrick Stewart) & Magneto(Ian McKellen) decide to transport Logan/Wolverine's(Hugh Jackman) consciousness to his younger self, 50 years to the past in 1973, to prevent a cataclysmic event that causes the creation of the Sentinels. They do this, with the help of Kitty Pryde's(Ellen Page) phasing powers. Here, Wolverine meets, Charles Xavier(James McAvoy), Erik Lensherr(Michael Fassbender), Hank/Beast(Nicholas Hoult), Raven/Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) & a few others. With the help of his fellow mutants, Wolverine has to stop this event by any means necessary, if there is any hope left for the future. X-Men: Days of Future Past is a brilliant film. There are absolutely no flaws. The special effects are outstanding. Director Bryan Singer returns with a bang! Singer effortlessly maneuvers with his massive star cast. All the major players get equal screen time. Days of Future Past is not just a movie with a lot of spectacular action set-pieces. It is an action movie with an emotional core at its center. The encounter between the two Charles of the movie, is worth the ticket price alone. The performances in the film are awe-inspiring. Hugh Jackman is outstanding as Logan/Wolverine. Jackman portrays a subdued Wolverine this time around, as opposed to the animal-like nature of his character. This is because the situation called for it. Since Wolverine has to unite all the mutants, Jackman can't go ballistic for no reason! James McAvoy is spectacular as Charles Xavier. McAvoy portrays a damaged & scarred Charles, effortlessly! For me, McAvoy is the standout performer of the entire film. Michael Fassbender is amazing as Erik Lensherr. Fassbender shines yet again, as the mutant anti-hero. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Raven/Mystique. Lawrence easily switches from the innocent Raven of First Class, to the vengeful Mystique of Days of Future Past. Halle Berry is impressive as Storm. Nicholas Hoult is great as Hank/Beast. Ellen Page is awesome as Kitty Pryde. Peter Dinklage is awe-inspiring as antagonist, Dr. Bolivar Trask. Shawn Ashmore is good as Bobby/Iceman. Evan Peters is hysterical as Peter/Quicksilver. Josh Helman is effective as Maj. Bill Stryker. Daniel Cudmore, Bingbing Fan, Omar Sy, Adan Canto, Booboo Stewart, Lucas Till & Evan Jonigkeit are impressive as Colossus, Blink, Bishop, Sunspot, Warpath, Havok & Toad, respectively. Mark Camacho is great as President Nixon. Last but definitely not the least, thespians, Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen are legendary as Professor X & Magneto. X-Men: Days of Future Past is a must watch. Keep up the good work, Bryan Singer. I can't wait for X-Men: Apocalypse.",NA
"hosseinalien","26 August 2022","It was a wonderful movie, from the excellent actors to the script of the movie, which in my opinion brought enough excitement from the very beginning of the movie. In my opinion, the best scene of the movie was when Charz was talking to his future selfAlthough the topic of time in this movie was complicated, but it was really a good topic, they brought the past well to the viewers and the dark future, which I found attractive.",NA
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","10 July 2017","While I liked Days of Future Past, in the end I felt a bit disappointed - not by the film itself, which was fine, but by the realisation that it was made as a rebooting vehicle.The story is fairly easy to simplify down to ""X-Men meet Terminator"", but the action scenes are good, some are even great, the main cast is doing a good job (James McAvoy for example seemed to me to be doing a better job than at First Class), while the (shorter than we'd like) presence of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is always superb. Peter Dinklage makes a fine villain, although his role could be bigger as well.The usual problem with this sort of time travel films is, ironically, the predictability. It was a particularly easy guess that the future heroes would die, but the mission would succeed, so no harm done. Which makes the death scenes of heroes like Storm or the parting words between X and Magneto lose all of their dramatic value, and work simply as a way to say goodbye not to the characters, but to the actors. Which brings us to the second issue - this may be just a personal quirk, but I do not appreciate alternate timelines. I realise it's a very common comic-book trope, but it seriously bothers me to have a film end by telling me ""you know what, all the previous X-Men films never happened! Jean is alive, everyone is happy, hooray!"". While I understand the reasoning, both dramatically and from a marketing point of view ('we want to make films with the new actors, because these ones are old' or something) I find it dishonest, cheap, and more importantly, subversive to all the previous movies.So all in all, I liked the film, but would much prefer it if it had somehow set its divergence point at some point after the Last Stand - though I will admit I don't see how they could do that AND include the new cast.",NA
"Bruce722","25 May 2014","Day of Future Past is a fantastic superhero movie in every way, shape and form... except for the gaping flaw that is its premise. Don't get me wrong, I understand that one must suspend their level of disbelief greatly in order to enjoy these films. Newsflash, I love superhero movies so clearly the suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. There is a difference between being willing to accept something as possible and there being a monumental plot hole, which was the case with this film.***SPOILERS*** The movie is set WAY into the future where these ""robots"" called Sentinels have effectively wiped out all mutants in existence and a large portion of the human population as well. Because these Sentinels are too much for the X-Men, they conceive of a plan to send Professor X's consciousness back in time to his younger self, when the Sentinels program was in its infancy in the 1970's, so he can stop Mystique from killing the creator of the program and then being captured and experimented on, which is what results in the Sentinels being the unstoppable force they become. Because sending someone's consciousness back decades would physically tear them apart, the only man for the job is none other than Wolverine.And that's the premise of the film. Did nobody else scream ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!"" when reading that? Allow me to clarify once again. I am willing to accept that there are invincible robots, that mutants exist, and that you can send someone's consciousness back in time decades for an extended period of time. I have no problem with any of those concepts because I have suspended my disbelief completely. However, if you know who creates this horrible program and you can send someone back in time, wouldn't you just send Logan a little further back and kill the creator, effectively eliminating the threat of the Sentinels before they ever exist?There are other plot holes throughout the film but I'd categorize those as relatively minor, akin to the ones you will typically find, not just in superhero movies but in films in general, so I won't go into detail on those. I'll simply say that a 9 or 10 caliber superhero movie with incredible acting, especially from James McAvoy, great special effects, and awesome action scenes easily drops to a 6 or 7 caliber movie because every single dramatic element was clouded with an ""If they did this obvious thing, none of this crap would've happened"". (6 + 7)/2 = 6.5, which rounds to 7. That's about the best explanation possible for my reasoning.",NA
"vincentkropf","20 November 2021","Best movie ive ever seen wolverine is so cool dont listen to the bad reviews this movie is so awseome best Xmen movie ever... you have to see that movie when you are a marvel fan.",NA
"indapamod","24 May 2014","If Kitty has to send someone (Wolverine) back in time, why not go back even further and stop Trask from experimenting on other Mutants? Add to it, Magneto is aware of the mess the mutants would be in, if they kill humans. Magneto has a change of heart towards the humans and tried killing Mystique, to save the mutants in the future. But he flips and goes back to destroying the White House, nullifying the attempt to not appear a villain in the eyes of the humans. Wolverine never ages. So what's with those white streaks? Too many issues that were left hanging. The whole going back in time kinda messed up the whole time line for the X-Men franchise.",NA
"Dragonsouls","24 May 2014","Days of Future Past is by far, the best of the X-Men films. I can't recall when a film franchise managed to weave in the past and the present like this before, and even though the writers tried hard to throw in tidbits of info for the sake of continuity, but I can't help but applaud Brian Singer for putting it together in such a seamless manner. Expect to see some cameos too! This is Brian Singer's most beautiful film, and I'm not biting back any words when I say that it truly is a brilliant piece of film-making. The camera-work, the lighting, the vantage points, the use of Slow-Mo, the blur effects during the Charles meets Charles scene...it was just so masterfully done and unexpected. There were some instants where the action was shown from the perspective of old 1970s grainy TV footage, and it seemed as if we were watching real, historical, archived footage that was locked away in some CIA vault! The main cast, as expected was nothing short of brilliant--and I'd like to start with Micheal Fassbander. He stole the show in my opinion, and I also thought McAvoy, and Lawrence had some Oscar worthy, tear-jerking scenes. Besides the fantastic acting by this young, talented trio, they also had the some of the coolest action scenes. There was an airport scene in the film that featured Mystique and McAvoy, and I thought it was amazing--both on an artistic and technical level. I thought Magneto's superpowers were really stretched to a whole knew level in this film, such as the scene where he was disarmed and still fired the gun as it fell...so creative! However, the single best action scene belonged to the character Quicksilver. His scene was absolutely beautifully shot and should be shown in film schools!As for the rest of the cast, they all put in solid efforts. Hugh Jackman made for a good wise-cracker as usual, Stewart and McKellan had their moments, however brief they might have been. I really would have liked to see more Dinklage in this film, and I thought Peter Dinklage did such a fine job at playing a scientist that was deeply concerned with Homeland security. However, his screen-time was sadly limited.Other than that, I really have nothing negative to say about this excellent film, except that it may require multiple viewings for some people who aren't accustomed to Time Travel based science fiction. I myself, am a die-hard Star Trek fan, and so I had no trouble with the complex plot. Just hearing Patrick Stewart say the words-- ""We must go back in time"" was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this is one of the top 3 best superhero films ever made!",NA
"paulmurray141","23 May 2014","The hype may have left me ultimately underwhelmed. For a film which was chalked full of potential, I can't help but feel it could have been a lot better. No denying it was a good film, on the same level as X2 and First Class give or take half a star. The future scenes were immense, Sentinels were insanely overpowered! Quicksilver's part was as good as it was brief. The best parts of the film were so short that throughout the rest of the film, I longed for more, rather than appreciating the Mystique Show. I felt Wolverine particularly wasn't used properly. The past really missed out on introducing characters to the full story rather than just the 1 in a bit-part role. Overall, a good superhero film, but not the classic I hoped for and in all honesty, expected.",NA
"juribeldman","9 June 2016","When the news that Matthew Vaughn, the excellent director of X- Men:First Class, would not be directing a sequel everybody was surely sad. But when Bryan Singer came on and made a return then it all seemed to be worth it. To tell the truth, Days of Future Past is the best movie in the franchise yet. Nothing has beaten it as Tim Millers Deadpool really did not get close to this and X- Men:Apocalypse is clearly not over this here. Bryan Singer does it great and cool, playing with his awesome characters and rooting them to do stuff they do all very well. The sense of the first main X-Men prequel is still her and every character is as he or she should be. The only bad thing here is that we have seemingly lost the sense of the first 2 x-men movies, but its a long awaited reunion that proves that the x-men are back in movie business with great hands.",NA
