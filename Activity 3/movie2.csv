"Logan","Tweekums","7 May 2018","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.Those expecting another 'X-Men' film will certainly get a bit of a shock; this is not an exciting superhero movie suitable for all but young children. Instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as Logan and Laura remove limbs and puncture skulls with their adamantium claws. There are some genuine surprises as bad things happen to characters one would expect to be safe. Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role, showing a different side to Logan; he is no longer young and angry, instead he is old and world-weary. Young Dafne Keen impresses as Laura; an almost feral girl who makes Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass' look gentle! There are nods to other films; most notably 'Shane', which Laura watches with Xavier and their search for the possibly mythical Eden in North Dakota reminded me of a different Logan's search for Sanctuary in 'Logan's Run'. I'd certainly recommend this to older X-Men fans but would caution against showing it to younger fans as it is very violent and has some pretty depressing moments.","

"Logan","mbhgkmsgg","8 November 2020","Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.Very early on in the film, I got huge John Wick vibes. The action was very reminiscent of those films. It was fast, it was brutal and graphic, and it wasn't afraid to show everything. Indeed, you got the sense that Mangold was trying to find more and more interesting and gory ways to kill people. Something that the John Wick franchise also does. This comparison between John Wick and Logan is nothing but a positive one. If you ask me, the John Wick films are some of the best action films to have come out in recent years, as is Logan.Where Logan really shines though, is not in the action, but in the story of Logan. It's a depiction Logan that I think a lot of people have wanted to see. Although I'm by no means an expert on the comic books, I have always had the feeling that Logan is a much more complex and difficult character than the previous X-Men or Wolverine films have led to believe. Logan is just as brutal with its depiction of the character as it is with its action.Logan really should be used a case study on how to do a comic book film. The only problem it faces is its R rating. I absolutely loved the rating as it allowed the film to go as dark as it needed and wanted to go. But comic book movies are, of course, supposed to be the highest-grossing films studios make, and an R rating will automatically lower revenues.If you have been looking for a comic book film that isn't just like all the previous ones, Logan is the one for you. As mentioned, it is brutally honest and gritty, and the action is more brutal than you would ever dare to expect. It's a fantastic action film but it also manages to create such an impressive story that you will find yourself amazed with the depth of it.
Is it my favourite comic book movie ever? No. But is it easily one of the best ones? Absolutely.","

"Logan","ACollegeStudent","12 August 2022","Rating: 7.9Solid, abnormal superhero film that's unpredictable with high stakes considering everybody dies besides Laura and her friends. There were some minor conveniences like Gabriela recording the evidence on her phone which was somehow unlocked allowing Logan to learn the info about laura he needed. Laura driving seemingly the entire latter half of a 2 day trip to Eden. Laura not being there just when Gabriela got canned when she usually keeps a constant watch on her because she's a mutant (possible professor meddling mind there). The father-daughter dynamic was nice and Logan went out like the hero everyone believed him to be.","

"Logan","TheJediWay9","2 March 2017","""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless. Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that. From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute ""hack-and-slash"" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role. This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.From me ""Logan"" gets a perfect 10/10.","

"Logan","trublu215","23 February 2017","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","

"Logan","hitchcockthelegend","5 August 2017","SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.Logan's Run!Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10","

"Logan","shawneofthedead","1 March 2017","Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body – tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to – seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters. The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.In effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film – strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact – fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving – will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.That doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings – from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills. The fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch – as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time. To be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind – the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath. And, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here – often in the film's saddest moments. There are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable – there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.But this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters.","

"Logan","NpMoviez","1 September 2019","Wolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or totally stupid. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series.Good : Hugh Jackman gives the most intense and gritty performance as Wolverine in his final film role as the adamantium clawed mutant. I have always loved him as Wolverine, but he has never been so good. Patrick Stewart does the same in his final role as Charles Xavier, and in his part, there's nothing to complain either. Dafne Keen as Laura - owns the film. Loved the kid as baby/lady Wolverine (X-23). The setting feels really different in this movie, compared to those of other X-Men films. It is obvious that they gave a Revisionist Western tone to the movie, which hasn't been done in the genre so far. It acknowledged the fact that it was inspired by Unforgiven, The Wrestler and Shane, which if had not been done, would've made it look like a ripoff. Not a total waste of a film, it has good parts, but still a copied idea without acknowledgement seems bad. Then, there is action. The actions are the best ones in the entire X-Men film series. The choreography is great to say the least. It looks badass, savage and intense. But there's one thing that this film does with action which most action films don't with these days. And that is, have the actions mean something. Every action scene has a purpose. It either sets up a characterization, or aggressively portrays what a character is feeling. Acting, action and the overall story won't disappoint. Also, all the characters are interesting.Mixed : There are some story issues. It feels as if there is a huge story that needs to be told between the altered timeline of DoFP and Logan. We get tiny little expositions for that matter and sound like much more interesting ideas for a better X-Men Apocalypse movie. This made the largely different characterizations feel totally out of place, for both Xavier and Logan. It works for the movie, I like it, but I don't buy it. It felt a lot out of the place and quite confusing with why they were so different. With all the movies in the series, I don't think they have given all the character development necessary for those changes.Bad : Mostly, it's the villain and some logic issues. There's a video narration/exposition which looked professionally edited with great voiceover, but was by a nurse who didn't even have 12 hours to do it, keeping aside the resources. Xander Rice doesn't feel so good of a villain. Nothing to blame Richard Grant, but just not a compelling villain. X-24 does have a frightening presence, I acknowledge that. But all his likeability depends upon the character arc of Wolverine over the years. Just take out the ""humane"" part of the character of Wolverine, and replace it with Terminator's menace. You'll get X-24.Conclusion : It's a good goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. You can get the unpleasant satisfaction of seeing him die, and it does hit emotional notes a number of times and feel really saddening. But there are story and characterization issues which cannot be overlooked and to be honest, do not make a good sense.Rating.Score : 8.2/10Grade : A-","

"Logan","ahmetkozan","21 April 2017","When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama.Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place.It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman. Logan, it's a goodbye we cannot forget for a long time. 9/10","

"Logan","badmanlykme","18 February 2017","Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl because they have striking similarities.Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine).","

"Logan","tavm","15 March 2017","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.","

"Logan","GomezAddams666","27 February 2017","LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.I HIGHLY recommend it.","

"Logan","Ramascreen","17 February 2017","LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.The story is set in the near future, mutants are thinning out. They've either died or been hunted down. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He's old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border, accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.Great move on the studio's and filmmakers' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who's been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to ""Breaking Bad"" for example, the film's ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.The writing is solid for a superhero film, it really digs deep into these beloved characters, how vulnerable they are, how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies, not only because they're now in their twilight years but there's also that father-son type of relationship that's tough love and endearing and then there's also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way, the little girl, Dafne Keen, who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force, so much energy, so much roar, she's like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice, what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that's uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who's the best at what he does but what he does isn't very nice.","

"Logan","kosmasp","15 July 2017","The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.A broken down Logan takes care of his former mentor and Professor at the Mutants Academy/school. Especially the Professor has lost a lot of his power (no pun intended). Those two are forced (you could have guessed that even without seeing the trailer) to go on one last road trip. And they have to because of a young girl. And while Logan seems not to care, circumstances do not leave him much choice.There are battles, there is drama and it is one of the best X-Men movies that has been made. There is also a lot of violence. This may be a comic book adaptation, but it certainly does not shy away from the brutality of its source. And this rawness helps it elevate, helps it become even more emotional, in more than one instance. Set in the future this is a good movie to end the Wolverine .... Trilogy","

"Logan","SnoopyStyle","5 July 2017","It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X. Overall, it's good bloody brutal violence with a familiar relationship and some new ones.","

"Logan","UMWolvie2442","18 February 2017","Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves. I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run.","

"Logan","bryank-04844","17 February 2017","For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.If anyone knows the Wolverine character, it's that he's a brutal, violent, hardcore rated R character, which is something we haven't seen in cinema form at least. That is until now with James Mangold's new film 'Logan', which is very much an R-rated movie, complete with blood, ultra-violence, nudity, and vulgar language. It's everything we've always wanted in a Wolverine movie – FINALLY! With the past three X-Men films, we've seen our favorite X-Men characters growing up as it served as the prequel to the 2000 film. 'LOGAN' is set in the year 2029 and the world has changed for the worst, at least for a mutant friends. This is a very bleak, dark, and violent film with some flashes of dark humor. Nobody is doing well in 2029 here, particularly Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has crawled inside a whisky bottle and has never came back out, with the exception of driving a limo for cash around town. He's old, mean, and his body is starting to fail him. When he's not driving or killing people, he takes care of Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from seizures and dementia, and who lives in a rusted out, abandoned water tower. Life is not good here for anyone.Meanwhile, a little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) crosses paths with Logan who seems to have the same abilities as the Wolverine himself. Logan is now charged with the task of transporting this little girl to a safe haven with Charles in tow, as a group of bad guys are after her, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). It's a fairly straight forward story and it takes its time setting up these older, dying characters, as well as its new ones. 'LOGAN' doesn't mess about with side tangent plot lines or love interests here. It's balls-to-the-wall, heart breaking action and drama, which is something we've wanted for a long time now with the Wolverine character. The script is written by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty, 'Minority Report') and Michael Green ('Heroes', 'Gotham'), which these two writers have expertly added in a fair dose of emotion into these characters, but never back pedal into past films. It was a breath of fresh air. James Mangold certainly was influenced by some of his favorite old western films, as can be seen in some of camera shots, which are just fantastic.Also, if you ever wanted to see Wolverine go berserk, you'll finally get that here on more than one occasion, complete with some long shots of Wolverine slicing and dicing the bad guys without any cuts. Simply amazing. In the past films, we've seen the characters Professor Xavier and Wolverine rather smart, witty, and put together for the most part. That's not the case here. These two characters are very sick and are not doing well mentally and physically. Jackman and Stewart give award worthy performances here, which might bring a tear or two down your face. It's that good. Newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura was also fantastic and very believable in every second she's on film. 'LOGAN' runs at about 135 minutes, which can seem a bit long, but everything is necessary here and for good reason. 'LOGAN' is the Wolverine film we've always wanted and it deserves some high recognition.","

"Logan","templar77099","12 June 2017","The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.","

"Logan","Horst_In_Translation","30 March 2017","Let me start by saying that ""Logan"" is my first favorite movie from 2017. And let me continue by saying that you should not read this review if you have not seen the film yet as it will be full of spoilers to an extent where the normal message up there is not enough and I would like to put special emphasis on this. Now lets go: James Mangold returns from the 2013 film ""Wolverine"" here and I think he did a really good job as this film never drags despite a runtime of over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It's probably still not my favorite from him (""Walk the Line""), but this should not take away anything from his effort. You will not really see too many familiar faces in this one except Jackman and Stewart. As for Stewart, there is one quote from him about mortality and this is a theme that fits the entire movie. Everybody keeps dying here, the good guys, the bad guys and the longer it goes the more you wonder if Logan will get out of it alive. The wolf has gone gray and he only has two friends left with whom he is arguing all the time. For example what I just said also applies to an innocent family of Black people and the dad is a perfect example of how hate towards the mutants is fueled, even if you cannot blame Jackman's character really for anything that happened to this family. It's all humans causing it with their decisions.This film has many parallels to other quality films like Léon The Professional (check my review title), Mad Max, Children of Men and this reminded me repeatedly of the child soldiers from the James Cameron television show ""Dark Angel"", a personal favorite. The ""Logan"" title cannot be coincidence right? Holbrook also reminded me a bit of Ames White with the Nazi-resembling race references, but if you know DA, you will see the similarities in general. Anyway, for fans of this series, it's probably the closest we're ever getting of a Dark Angel film with Cameron focusing on all these Avatar sequels right now. Now back to ""Logan"": If there is anything negative to say about this film, then maybe that the child soldier reference was not always working, but still this one also provided really touching scenes at the very end of the film and honestly the X grave was a stroke of genius and a perfect final shot. Also kinda fitting and cool that he can only be killed by his alternate self. It was a sad ending, but also an uplifting one with the next generation of mutants (and with the girl Wolverine left us) going out into the world. Johnny Cash song during the credits doesn't hurt either. Oh yeah and the pain from Stewart's character's brain was done so well you could feel it even in the theater. It is certainly a pretty depressing movie, but this also makes it really authentic I believe. There are very rare moments of situational comedy in there, like the fat kid being too fat to run and gets caught, but it's nowhere near the surface. This film delivers in 10 other areas much more than in comedy.I think I have only seen the very first X-Men film apart from this one here, so even as somebody who is not a fan of the series (but likes superhero movies), it's easy to appreciate this one. Huge fans will probably love it. I think it is impressive how this series is still going so strong after 20 years almost and it was the perfect decision back then to cast the entirely unknown Hugh Jackman for the part as he is a vital ingredient why this film was such a triumph, with critics as well as audiences. I like him a lot and I am certainly biased, but it's hard to disagree with his craft after seeing this movie. Will there be another? Unlikely. I just hope that the fate of Wolverine's character does not go in hand with the fate of Jackman's as you keep reading so frequently about his fight with skin cancer. ""Logan"" also includes a great deal of action which was among the more forgettable parts for me, but there's enough people who like it, so it's all good. And after all with this runtime, people like me also get a great deal of character development and drama besides the special effects. So there are more reasons to see this film than I could actually mention here. You totally do not want to miss out. Check it out now!","

"Logan","Her-Excellency","17 March 2017","I really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.Yes, I understand that Logan is a heartfelt character dear to us, but THINK people! For that very same reason we should be holding this movie to a higher standard, and not giving it an emotional pass.To, me, this film was slow and depressing a-la No Country For Old Men, without ANY of the Oscar-worthiness. It was just droll, SUPER PREDICTABLE, moronic in its' execution and so very far-fetched. (Yes, imagine saying 'far-fetched' for a movie based on a comic)! They spun and bent a bunch of things to get them to where they were in the year 2029 and tried to make it believable (it wasn't). Then, they try to impress upon your heartstrings Logan's connection or ties to the little girl, but the connection or ties are SILLY at best. Not only the supposed ties between them are silly, but the entire plot is full of silly holes.Not SILLY, you say? Let me get this straight ... you are trying like hell to get away from the bad guys, and ummmmm, you STOP FOR A MINI VACATION - not ONCE, but TWICE, and put hundreds of strangers in jeopardy the first time, and a nice family in danger the second time? Yeah, sure. Seriously, anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness and who can, after that, in good conscience give this movie anything above a 6 is just messing with you or has total fan-boy blinders on. As for the little girl, god, she was annoying and aggravating AF and 80% of her screen time was spent shrieking. Nooo, not screaming. SHRIEKING.The rest of the acting was good. The members of the family they added as filler in the middle of the movie were the only ones IMO that you kind of cared about. Even old Professor X had seen better days and you kind of wanted it to be over for him. It was just painful to watch, and I don't mean in a moving way where the film is made better, but in a painful oh god, kill him off already way.*** BIG SPOILERS BELOW *** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PLANNING ON SEEING IT!!!The ending was unreal in how bad it was. Without giving too much away ... you have one little girl who is able to take out like 10-12 guys, PLUS you have Wolverine, PLUS a BUNCH of other mutant kids who have varying degrees of mutant abilities, and yet they can't take out a small group of bad guys? W T H ?As for Hugh Jackman, he was good and played Logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older and more tired which was a good thing because it translated unto the screen and gave Wolverine some credibility. Otherwise he was just there. The gushing over his acting this time around IMO is unwarranted, as he really didn't do anything that much different than he has on every other X-Men movie and if anyone disagrees, I defy them to point out what. Props also to the action in the film, and to how it was filmed. The action scenes alone are what I imagine 'made' the movie for most people. All in all, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a horribly BAD movie, I just don't agree that it was very good and I really don't agree with the overrating or the assessment that it is in ANY way a ""masterpiece"". If you look at it just on paper, you would think that the people that are reacting to it in such a way have ONLY EVER watched comic-book movies in their lives and have now seen a drama sold as a comic-book movie and their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative and different.In closing, I understand that Hugh Jackman is getting older, and the great dilemma was 'how exactly do you keep making movies with an actor who is aging, playing a character who is supposed to rejuvenate or heal'? You don't. You kindly retire the character, as the creators of the franchise have chosen to do. The thing is, they could have really made it to where it wasn't SO depressing and/or bleak with no real outlook toward the future except a bunch of kids you are NOT at all INVESTED in, or care one iota about. A bad ending for a good character, was just bad cinema. RIP Logan. hopefully, at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given the farewell you deserve. My actual rating is 6.5-7/10, but some reviewers have gone over the top crazy with the 10s.","

"Logan","slicedbread117","4 June 2017","Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.Logan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvel's iconic 'Old Man Logan' comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the 'R' rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The 'R' rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements don't feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.Hugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.Wolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, who's X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isn't anything too special, but doesn't have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the driver's seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.The film's action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But it's not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, it's again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in ""The Wolverine"", we've never seen before. He's not invincible, and even with X-23's relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackman's time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.10/10","

At the same time, I will find it hard to believe, anyone , could in reality bring The Wolverine more to life then Hugh Jackman did, some actors, seem born to play certain roles. Overall?

"Logan","supermaggie","9 March 2017","I couldn't agree less with the positive reviews. This is not a realistic movie instead of a superhero movie (if you don't like superhero movies/movies based on comics - why watch X-Men/Wolverine at all? If you are so into ""realistic"" violence, go watch Hostel and other such abominations), this movie is just wrong. There is a reason that Mad Max movies are Mad Max movies and X-Men movies are X-Men movies and that Mad Max fans like Mad Max movies and X-Men fans like X-Men movies, and there may be an overlap between these two groups but I honestly doubt that these people understand the movies then since both series have a very different angle. And if you are into obscene, decadent, depraved madness and violence, feel happy to watch the disgusting Mad Max stuff and fry your brain. If you are into cool, creative, entertaining, positive, smart action and fun, you were being served right with the X-Men movies so far. This last Wolverine movie being a disappointing exception, reveling in blood and madness, without any coolness (and I do not mean / mind that Logan is older and weaker, that's absolutely fine with me) but dirt and vulgarity instead. The stupid girl doesn't make it any better, and the ending - well, actually, after watching this torture-like installment, I do not even mind the ending anymore this much, since if this are the sequels we could have expected, I prefer it to end. Would have never thought I would ever say this: not a good/worthy ending, but at least an end. If this is what people want to see, and if this is how the so far interesting X-Men series is meant to end, I can only confirm once more that people are crazy, primitive and all together completely different from me. I don't need such a vulgar display of brutality, neither do I enjoy it or give it a high rating. TWD is over since it lost its focus and Wolverine can now be buried, too, in any respect.","

"Logan","CalRhys","3 March 2017","In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.","

"Logan","john-collie-1","12 July 2023","""Logan,"" released in 2017, is not just another installment in the X-Men franchise. It's a raw, gritty, and deeply emotional exploration of the iconic Wolverine character, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman in what has been billed as his final appearance in the role. Directed by James Mangold, ""Logan"" pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre, delivering a film that is as much a poignant drama as it is an action-packed adventure.Set in a dystopian near-future, ""Logan"" sees an aged, weary Wolverine caring for a debilitated Professor X, played by Patrick Stewart. When a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen) enters their lives, they're forced on a cross-country journey that feels more akin to a classic western than a traditional superhero film.Jackman delivers a career-best performance in his farewell to the character he's embodied for nearly two decades. His Wolverine is worn down, haunted, and deeply vulnerable, yet still capable of intense ferocity. Jackman brilliantly navigates this complex emotional terrain, creating a deeply human character whose struggle with his past and fear of his future resonate profoundly.Stewart, too, delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X. His portrayal of a man grappling with a formidable brain disorder while still trying to mentor Logan and protect Laura is moving and nuanced. The relationship between Logan and Professor X is richly drawn, revealing new dimensions to these familiar characters.Newcomer Dafne Keen is a revelation as Laura. Her performance is fierce and touching, offering a fitting counterpart to Jackman's Wolverine. Her interactions with Jackman are among the movie's highlights, providing a unique father-daughter dynamic that's rarely seen in superhero films.Visually, ""Logan"" is a departure from its glossy, CGI-laden counterparts. The film's grounded cinematography and real-world settings add to the gritty realism that sets it apart. The action sequences, while brutal and visceral, never feel gratuitous. Each blow, each battle, feels deeply personal and consequential, adding to the overall emotional impact.The script, co-written by Mangold, tackles themes of loss, redemption, and the harsh cost of violence. There's an undercurrent of melancholy that runs throughout the film, amplified by the stripped-down, soulful score by Marco Beltrami.""Logan"" is a testament to the depth and richness that can be achieved within the superhero genre. It's a deeply affecting, character-driven piece that offers a fitting farewell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. With its superb performances, thoughtful narrative, and visceral action, ""Logan"" is a standout entry in the X-Men franchise and a bold, unforgettable piece of cinema.","

The Cornish Caliban was a big ask to accept and take seriously, and I only see the camp and drunk Withnail whenever Richard E. Grant pops up, which makes playing the bad guy a bit more of a challenge in my eyes. Plenty of violence and dismemberment if that floats your boat and a finale that might leave more questions than answers.","

"Logan","Leofwine_draca","26 July 2017","LOGAN is a fitting follow-up to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine series, directed by the returning James Mangold with a difference: this isn't your usual 12-rated superhero film but rather a gritty, adult movie full of profanity and bloodshed. Finally we get to see what Jackman's claws can properly do, and the film's regular violent action sequences are pure spectacle. The story is set decades in the future and sees an old-man Wolverine going on a road trip with a senile Charles Xavier and a mysterious young girl in tow.It's a dark story indeed, one that climaxes in a fitting way, and it's entirely refreshing to have adult content for a change. The film's biggest problem is that it goes on about half an hour too long and slows down in between the action, but it's not enough to spoil a fine viewing experience. The action is lavish and large scale, and the good cast features stand-out turns from Stephen Merchant and Richard E. Grant. The FX are up to the job, as is Jackman, who delivers a complex performance of great depth, one of the best of his entire career.","

"Logan","fung0","26 May 2017","The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)Logic holes abound:* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it.","

"Logan","Hitchcoc","14 January 2019","I've seen several X-men films already, but I have never been entirely sure of all the baggage and relationships. So as I watched this, I was pleased that the filmmaker assumed not everyone knew the underlying details. This was exciting. It's obvious that the original crew has fallen on hard times. Wolverine is falling apart. His healing ability is pretty much at its end. He has decided to try to withdraw and let life take its course. But, unfortunately, he is confronted by an evil next step by the lineage of the X-men experiments. This is a wild ride as his ""daughter,"" a clone of him, and he try to find other kids who have been changed and bring them to safety. Of course, the bad guys don't want their escapades to get out. I do have to say that I am really getting tired of all the gore and the endless fighting. Still, it was satisfying. It also leaves the doors open for a whole new generation.","

"Logan","alva3901","16 March 2017","The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe.","

Just silly. The Professor meets his demise, but the girl has grown on Logan so he takes her to the Canada border where they meet other mutant children.

Approx 95% of the movie is dedicated to Wolverine gimping around like a zombie, wincing in pain. 
Little makes sense, it's just a sloppy movie with little to no logical sequencing.The one chick needs Wolverine to take her and the kid to the border, but why? She has bundles of cash. She could pay anyone to take her... people who aren't radar magnets like wolverine. And could they make up their mind about the kid. One minute she's running around like she has led up her butt the next minute she's running around like Benny Hill. Also one minute she doesn't understand English the next she understands English, but speaks in Spanish, the next she's bilingual. 
And the old dude's best day in a long time is the day that he gets an entire family killed.... good times!This movie is significantly artificially inflated because homeboy dies in the end.","

"Logan","srdjan_veljkovic","8 March 2017","Yes, it's very different from other superhero movies. Not just that it takes inspiration from classic westerns, but also showing superheros when they are out of control, in fear, vulnerable, just trying to get by, rather than ""solving the world's problems"".But, otherwise, it doesn't have much going for it. Hugh Jackman tries, but his ""Old Man Logan"" is strange, somehow you don't feel his struggles. You see them, but you don't feel them. Patrick Stewart does a fine job of depicting an old and sick Professor X, but his story is rather undeveloped, so, again, you don't feel it. OTOH, the X-23 is going ""full feminist rage"", and at 11 is much better than Wolverine ever was - you obviously can only feel silly about that.In trying to escape explaining too much, they went overboard. They explain way too little. What's wrong with Professor X and Wolverine? Is it the same as the other mutants or not? What happened to other mutants? I mean, there's this virus and that's it? Come on, there were some geniuses there, The Beast, Emma Frost, Professor X, Jean Grey - surely they figured out something was wrong and tried to fight it. OK, they lost, but we feel way too disconnected with them to make us feel for the ones left behind.Looking at this movie at its own, it has the problem of many modern movies of loosing its ""steam"" near the end. Start is OK, hey, there's even a few jokes after the first clash. But, afterwards, while trying, it fails to provide real meaning to all of this. Things happen, so it's not boring, but, it doesn't feel real or meaningful - and the ""party line"" is that this should ""feel real, unlike other superhero movies"". One of the problems is there are no more funny moments, which is not real in general, and especially for Professor X and Wolverine, who both had their distinctive senses of humor.So, it's an OK watch because it's a fresh, different take on a somewhat washed-up genre, but don't expect too much.","

"Logan","Quinoa1984","4 March 2017","I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.All of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing ""F"" and ""S"" words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.But alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.So I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters.","

It takes place in the future...fine, but there is little explanation as to why and how things have come about and where some of the characters came from.Particularly X23. Why, why, why, why, why, why? We'd like to know...but that's either a movie for another time or they just didn't think we'd care enough to wonder about her.Next time, we'd like to know a bit more. It's not too much to ask.Or better yet, stop for a while. Refresh. Drop the X-Men, you have more to work with, X-Force, X-Factor, New Mutants, Excalibur, to name a few.Let the X-Men rest and either pick up something you can do fresh without a reboot, or just let the licenses revert, because honestly, it's starting to really hurt to watch and you're starting to tick the fans off.At this point it feels, especially with ""Apocalypse,"" that they are just making movies to keep the licenses. ""The Last Stand"" was awful, true, but the franchise was brilliantly rebooted with ""First Class."" They took the time to address continuity issues, they took the time to respect the concerns that the fans of the franchise had about the reboots and even tied up some of it in ""Days of Future Past.""With ""Apocalypse"" they threw away everything they worked so hard to preserve in both the original franchise and the reboot. ""Logan"" does much the same thing, it takes a once respected timeline and throws it all away, leaving just a movie, a stand alone song that doesn't fit in with the rest of the Franchise album.They aren't trying to protect the franchise any longer, they are just turning out movies with complete disregard over how they fit in with the established story.","

"Logan","Platypuschow","26 July 2017","After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world. One does have to wonder if he'd have had as much success if he'd worn the proper Wolverine yellow spandex though!","

"Logan","chera_khalid","30 September 2023","""Logan"" is a cinematic triumph that slashes through the superhero genre, leaving an indelible mark of raw emotion and gritty realism. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is a tour de force, a poignant swan song for the iconic character. The film editing is a masterclass in pacing, seamlessly blending brutal action sequences with moments of poignant reflection. The haunting musical score, composed by Marco Beltrami, amplifies the film's emotional weight, underscoring the struggle for redemption and the inevitability of mortality. The film's strength lies in its unflinching exploration of legacy, sacrifice, and the toll of a life filled with violence. The cinematography captures the desolate landscapes with a visual poetry that complements the grim narrative. With a 9/10 rating, ""Logan"" transcends the superhero genre, standing as a testament to the potential for profound storytelling within the realm of comic book adaptations.","

"Logan","Danusha_Goska","5 March 2017","If you've ever wanted to watch a little girl roll a severed human head over a dusty parking lot, go see ""Logan."" ""Logan"" is a violent, gory, hateful, ugly, senseless and charmless movie. Hugh Jackman stars as Wolverine, aka Logan, a man with retractable claws in his hands. He connects with Laura, a mutant like himself. The girl is trying to escape from mistreatment in Mexico to a safe house in Canada called ""Eden."" She is being pursued by a bad guy, a white man with – you guessed it – a Southern accent. And I bet you already know the bad guy's name – it's Donald. Donald chasing a Mexican girl who must escape to safety in Canada – I know what you are thinking. This is an artistically and intellectually ambitious film that will deliver more than clichés. Abandon all such hope anyone who buys a ticket for this splatter mess. In fact why not just stay home and watch terrorist videos on YouTube? Hugh Jackman may as well not even have appeared in this bloated, exploitative, anti-human mess. The film is just one long hyperviolent chase scene. Donald catches up with Logan and Laura, and there is a lengthy fight involving decapitations, dismemberment, and graphic impalement of various body parts. You see Logan's blades puncturing faces and skulls. When the director feels that the fight scene has gone on long enough, Logan and Laura make a temporary escape. Donald regroups, lather, rinse, repeat. There are a couple of gratuitous Christophobic images. One of the bad guys has a Christian cross tattooed on his arm. The arm is removed from his body. In another scene, a cross is repurposed into an X, for X- Men.","

"Logan","chaos-rampant","28 January 2020","I admit I was taken aback with this one. I hadn't planned on watching as Wolverine films tend to be a bore to me. Not long into it, I was sure I had missed a previous film, one that would explain for example how Xavier ended up broken and hidden away, how Wolverine has washed up as an alcoholic limo driver.But no this is it apparently, and this is the thing.We can be lowered late at night in the middle of a world that has long now been spun in motion. We can discover as we go. We can catch glimpses of a larger world as we move through it. We don't need to be racing to save the world, making it out of this room alive is enough, wondering and having no idea where to turn to next are fine.None of it is novel, in fact all of them mainstays of 80s film, from Bladerunner to Terminator. But after a glut of samey, mechanized Marvel and X- men movies obsessed with 'universing' a greater story, this one feels welcome and fresh.Another obvious influence here are western films and this probably sheds some light on Wolverine's popularity. So many of the other X-men have awesome abilities to alter the fabric of reality; Wolverine is just a gruff who kicks and punches his way through. It seems there's always going to be a hankering for the simple, uncomplicated guy.So what more obvious choice than to cast him in the light of cowboy? It works but you'll note it's not any cowboy. They could have used Red River as template, or The Searchers. They used Shane. The flawed guy who risks all to ensure there are 'no more guns in the valley' but must ride off again at the end because his kind has no place in the world of loving farmsteads.It's always indicative of a broader sensibility when I see this type being used, the resignation that someone has no place in a changing world and is better off being swept away with the old, this seen as 'honorable' and heroic.But from the little girl (and her friends') point-of- view we have what? A fictional Eden they only knew as stories in a book but their desire for it has inspired an actual one.","

"Logan","dhxmansarbajna","4 March 2017","James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful.","

"Logan","Mike_Devine","13 August 2017","Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.In 'Logan,' we have a much darker, grittier story in which Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is faced with helping a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escape the anti-mutant strongholds of Mexico and the USA to Canada. In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.In addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.There are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.While it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans.","

"Logan","milk-carton-reviews","29 June 2017","Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.I'm actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn't particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he's such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I've read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook's portrayal of him. Honestly, I don't believe we've had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I'm excited to watch Boyd's show ""Narcos"" now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can't stress that enough. I want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it's amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it's amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It's truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I'm almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we're used to, and that's another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don't really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That's an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they're not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the ""normal"" people being killed off by the government, and I really don't think that's the message that was needed right now. However, ""Logan"" is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can't even consider giving it a lower than perfect score. I'm excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It's definitely up there with the likes of ""The Dark Knight"". However, this movie can stand alone as something more than ""just a superhero film"", and as I've heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It's time for a little change in the genre. While I can't say I'm particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after ""Apocalypse"" (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I'm more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is ""Logan"".","

"Logan","harrylosborne","7 May 2019","Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.To merge these two themes of darkness and lightheartedness is near-impossible, as pandering to child and adult audiences is more than difficult. Logan does as good a job as can be expected, using humour sparsely without ruining emotional moments that make up the core of the film. Jackman is unshakeable in his titular role, bringing the same intensity he has to the Wolverine role he had for the previous 16 years; this film allowed him to flex his acting muscles slightly more freely, not constrained by superhero films' typically wooden scripts. Patrick Stewart is also excellent as Professor X, reduced to an ambling shell of what he used to be, but ultimately Logan's only friend.The storyline of Logan isn't a world-beater (Wolverine seems to suffer from a lack of decent plots), but for someone who has stuck with the franchise for its duration, it will surely satisfy any hardcore fans. As a standalone, Logan holds itself in higher regard than almost any other superhero film, delivering emotional punches successfully without cheapening scenes using ill-timed humour.","

"Logan","ReelLifeReviews","8 March 2017","Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10.","

"Logan","daddyxj-1","25 July 2017","What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended.","

"Logan","elenaphysics","26 July 2018","This movie is terrible. Awful. Hideous. I mean who likes to see a young girl decapitating people? This was even worse than wolverine 2. 
It was the worst possible ending to wolverine and professor X.
I am not going to lie, I don't know those character endings based on the comics they rely on. But even if they did die this way, films have the freedom to depict whatever they like.
You don't have to kill wolverine. You can always recast him.
Wolverine is a legend, as well as Superman and Batman. 
Any the movie was sad. A monstrous girl , created by Logan's unique blood sample. And Logan becames very old, he is dying actually and all he does , he takes care of professor X who has ceisures that endager all people around him.
BUT WOLVERINE does not have to grow old. He is an immortal. He has lived through centuries without a scratch. And suddenly he is so weak.. 
And his hideous daughter. What a freakish hellish child. So marvel wants to reaplace Wolverine with that abomination?
I am so sad they ruined the whole wolverine idea..","

"Logan","FlashCallahan","2 March 2017","In a hideout near the U.S./Mexico border, an ageing Logan cares for the ailing Professor X who is suffering from a form of dementia. But their sheltered existence comes to a end when a young mutant girl arrives and needs their help to stay safe.....Last year's Deadpool showed audiences and the studios just how successful an adult orientated comic book hero film can be.Logan show's how well an adult orientated comic book film is.The last two standalone Wolverine films were very lacklustre to say the least, they had no coherence, felt rushed, and just didn't have the consistency to tell the story of one of the most interesting comic book heroes of all time.But this film, goes above and beyond the call of duty to tell the final chapter in the titular characters story, and it's been worth the wait since we were introduced to Wolverine back in august 2000.As you all know, it's not your atypical comic book film. It's not effervescent, it's not full of wonderful humour and groundbreaking effects, it doesn't feature talking ducks or gods, this is a western, a western with mutants.If you look outside of the box, this is a film about oppression, an oppression that's been exploited by the masses via comic books and legend, and it's quite meta that the film let's the full universe into the film subliminally via what's in the films backpack.For what's going on in the world, this is a very topical film, the three are outcasts, no one warms to them, almost everyone are antagonised by them aside from....the African American family who take them in for the night to offer them a meal.The film also focuses on redemption, and how the narrative will not let certain characters redeem themselves. In one scene in-particular, a character confesses something to someone, but it falls on dead ears, because it's not the person they thought it was.Jackman is brilliant, and in his ninth performance as Logan, he's putting his all in this. This is his definitive performance as Logan, both physically and verbally. Gone is the wise-cracking hero who had a rapport with his colleagues, this Logan has demons, he's lonely, and dependent on alcohol. His body is strewn with scars, and it feels as if he's just waiting to die.Stewart, as well, is wonderful. Again totally different to how you've seen Xavier before, more short tempered, but he has an unconditional love for Logan that cannot be broken. The dinner scene is probably on of the most touching scenes I've seen in this genre, proving that these two are platonic soul mates, and would do anything for one another.There are a few surprises in the film, all changing the course of the narrative, and then there's the case with the violence.It's pretty shocking, there are quite a few wince inducing moments, but the profanity is thrown around everywhere, and it feels like they are trying to get as many f-bombs in this film as they can.Many are comparing this to 'Shane' the comparisons are rife, right up to them watching the film, and referencing lines, but the relationship between Logan and the girl slightly reminded me of the relationship between Costner and the boy in Eastwood's 'A Perfect World'.The villains in the film are your atypical soldier types with tattoo's and swagger, and the backstory about the girl is again, focusing on oppression and borderline slavery.But it's a monumental film, one of the best comic book films released thus far, and I think that the MCU may have to rethink their safe strategy with their films, as this is Marvel's The Dark Knight.outstanding....","

"Logan","Aaron1375","27 June 2017","I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fiancé had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.The story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.I enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.So the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role.","

"Logan","paul_haakonsen","15 April 2017","Now, first and foremost I must stand forth and say that superhero movies is not my go-to pick of movies when presented with alternate choices. Why? Well, because I just don't really enjoy the superhero theme all that much. Usually, they provide nothing more than visual entertainment for me.However, I will say that ""Logan"" manages to stand out in the superhero genre; a genre that is well-diluted with mediocre attempts of bringing comic book heroes to life on the big screen. ""Logan"", however, steps away from the absurdly generic mould that superhero movies tend to follow, and it is not the superhuman powers of the characters that is the drive behind the movie.What makes ""Logan"" so good and entertaining, is that this is a movie intended for a mature audience, and it leaves the generic superhero archetype behind as it has been seen in most previous ""X-Men"" movies. With that being said, I will also continue on to state that ""Logan"" is actually the best of all the installments into the ""X-Men"" universe on the big screen so far.This is a movie that is driven by a good story, and spiced up with good characters and good acting all around. This is also the most violent and bloody of all the ""X-Men"" movies, take it as it is, like it or dislike it - that is a personal preference, of course. I did, however, enjoy the approach and the more dark atmosphere that permeated this entire movie. It was refreshing not to see a rose-tinted superhero movie where you know that the heroes will prevail against insurmountable odds.Sure, the effects in ""Logan"" are great, and they do help the movie along quite nicely.I was more than genuinely surprised with how good ""Logan"" turned out to be, and this movie does have enough entertainment contents to sustain multiple viewings. My rating for ""Logan"" is 8 out of 10 stars, without a doubt. And this is a well-worthy addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise.","

"Logan","carolrmag","23 April 2017","I am a fan of the X-Men movies. They are all fun and exciting to watch. They are also beautiful to see. This is not true for Logan. Sadly.The movie isn't fun, the surroundings are sad. The same for the characters. To see beloved heroes turn into decadent sad characters is awful.They do die has heroes. But very broken ones.Other characters are poorly written.And I got the felling, at the end, that the ""bad guys"" were stronger, even if the mutant children got away. With the death of Logan, they run away into the woods, scared. No teacher left behind to guide them and teach them to manage their abilities and hopefully save the world.No. They are left alone in a dark world. Their hero was a drunken sad Logan, that didn't taught anything positive.Sad, sad, sad. And ugly.","

"Logan","destroyerwod","23 May 2017","What do i mean by this? Well i refuse that the ""Xmen Saga"" end up on such a depressing note. Wolverine has always been the best part of the Xmen movies, and yet every attempt they made to make a solo movie felt flat. As much as it hurt me to say it, i feel Origins is probably the best of the 3, even with the insult to Deadpool... At least it was dumb fun... But The Wolverine was over complex for nothing and just bored me, and this one although not boring me per say felt so depressing and dull in atmosphere with such a bad story that i want to whip it out of my memory.I am giving it a 5 because the movie does have quality. The acting is very good from everybody, the landscape and cinematography is great, the brutal action sequences are extremely good, finally seeing Wolverine brutally decapitate and slash peoples is very nice.Yet the story is just so bad... Basically they tell you almost every mutants died because they poisoned the food... and Charles pretty much killed all the Xmen in one of his seizure moments. So it mean everything they accomplished during the years was almost for nothing... As much as i didn't liked that much Days of Futur past and tough it really changed too much, at least the end make it feel right by the franchise and give overall a happy ending, even retconing the deaths that happened in Last Stand.I could go on and make a rant about how the story was changed so much during the years that it created tons of plot holes, especially with Charles in Last Stand and his return later on, but i prefer to focus on Logan and don't go too much all over the place. I just feel that there way of whipping out the Mutants was very weak, and the reasons for Wolverine to loose regeneration once again(was it not the theme of ""The Wolverine""?) just didn't do it for me. Even without regeneration, is he not supposed to still have the Adamantium Skeleton? So why does a Tree manage to impale him? And the whole Adamantium bullet, from Origins to this change too much.The clone villain really felt uninspired and flat and although Donald the henchman guy was presented as an important character and having ""enchancements"" in the end he and his men only served as claw fodder and did nothing much.I am gonna stop there as i feel i could rant all day.","

"Logan","UnderworldRocks","24 March 2017","This is highly overrated. This is nowhere near as good as critics say it is. 1 star for the little girl.The X-MEN series has always been filled with continuity errors. The first 3 movies were pretty consistent. Then there were prequels telling stories that contradict the old trilogy. Hey! Remember Mystique? She is said to be of the same age with Charles Xavier in the prequels, whereas in the old trilogy, well...Also, the franchise has never been consistent in style. Most of the previous X-MEN movies are PG-13, quite typical for Marvel movies. This time it is R. However, there is not much difference, only more blood but not by much.The story does not make sense here and there. For example, had they shot the enemy instead of keeping him alive and attempting to dump him in the middle of nowhere, they could have avoided a lot of trouble later on. The Wolverine died saving a bunch of little mutant shitheads nobody cares about, who later on stood over his tomb, exchanging weird glances and as Laura quoted from an old movie, they seemed to be thinking, ""What the F..K is she babbling about?"" Clearly they haven't seen the old movie. Not to mention that the whole ""Save Laura"" Operation was based on a nurse who read lots of comic books. Who wrote the books?The movie educates us: 1. Never let the enemy off easily. 2. Never trust the comic books.","

"Logan","zardoz-13","18 March 2017","Twentieth Century Fox has brought the curtain down on its original ""X-Men"" franchise with the ""Wolverine"" spin-off ""Logan,"" co-starring Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart. ""Wolverine"" writer & director James Mangold's abrasive, slam-bang, but valedictory entry doesn't resemble the usual, optimistic, hyperbolic, Marvel spectacle with a vibrant ending. Mangold and scenarists Scott Frank of ""The Wolverine"" and Michael Green of ""Green Lantern"" have formulated an often violent, profane saga set twelve years into the future. Jackman and Stewart claim this movie marks the last time they will portray Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Unlike earlier franchise entries, ""Logan"" arrives with an R-rating for its ""strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity."" Saying that ""Logan"" sheds the kid gloves that previous ""X-Men""/ ""Wolverine"" movies wore amounts to an understatement. The ""Kids in the Mind"" website, for example, counted as many as 53 F-words and its derivatives, 24 scatological expressions, 9 anatomical names, and 6 minor obscenities. Although enough blood & gore flows for a half-dozen movies, the ferocity of watching various characters getting viciously battered as well as slashed and gouged constantly, usually with multiple blades skewering heads should keep squeamish audiences screaming and gorehounds drooling. ""Logan"" doesn't confine its murderous mayhem strictly to its valiant heroes and slimy villains. This anything-goes opus slaughters innocent bystanders with relative indifference. The thing to remember about ""Logan"" is Twentieth Century Fox produced it rather than Disney Marvel, so it doesn't resemble ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""The Avengers,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Mind you, the ""X-Men"" movie franchise probably won't vanish altogether since James McAvoy may still reprise his younger Professor Xavier, while a different actor will inevitably deploy those retractable, razor-sharp, adamantium claws that Hugh Jackman has wielded with such finesse in nine X-Men films over 17 years.First, ""Logan"" takes place in the year 2029. Although everything appears contemporary, Mangold has inserted some thought-provoking, futuristic touches, such as self-driving tractor-trailer rigs that careen along the highways oblivious to the safety of other motorists. Second, the heroes and villains dress like ordinary people, and Logan and Professor Xavier are far older than we've ever seen them. They are hiding out when the film unfolds, and Professor Xavier suffers from degenerative brain disease. Indeed, Xavier relies entirely on Logan to protect him from unscrupulous people that want to seize the man with ""most dangerous mind."" The two have sought refuge across the border in Mexico, and Logan works as a limo driver. He manages with considerable difficulty to keep Professor Xavier on medications that prevent him from suffering terrible psychic seizures. These seizures constitute the equivalent of earthquakes that can paralyze people in their shoes. Some audiences may be turned off by the commonplace reality with which Mangold and his writers have wall-papered ""Logan."" Jackman's grandpa version of the Wolverine is comparable to Frank Miller's depiction of an older Batman in the graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" except Logan is in far worse physical condition. Indeed, Logan can still slice and dice his adversaries like a Christmas turkey, but his healing powers have waned. A physician warns Wolverine that he may be suffering from adamantium poisoning. The first scene shows Logan awakening from a siesta in his luxurious 2024 Chrysler limo to find a gang of truculent border trash trying to steal his tires. Our hero approaches them, and a fracas erupts that leaves several either dead or wounded. Wolverine, however, emerges the worst for wear, staggering about clumsily as he slashes and gashes his aggressive opponents who blast away at him. He is often shown repeatedly guzzling liquor and dresses in a sloppy manner. Director James Mangold stages Logan's hand-to-hand combat scenes so each battle has a chaotic and frenzied spontaneity. Nothing about the fights that ensue appear visually cool and kinetic as they were in earlier ""X-Men"" films. Sometimes, Logan looks like he is going to lose until he lets his rage fuel his ferocity. Logan discovers that a desperate Mexican woman, Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez of ""Miami Vice""), has been following him. She has a group of mutant children with her. These children are not only trying to elude the henchmen, but they also trying to reach safety across the Canadian border. She pleads with Wolverine to drive them to their destination. He refuses to acknowledge her presence, but then discovers that an obnoxious enforcer, Pierce (Boyd Holbrook of ""Run All Night""), with a mechanical hand and a cynical Southern drawl, from the Mexican research facility Transigen wants to recapture the children. These children are laboratory mutants on the lam. One of them, Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), brandishes lethal claws like Wolverine; she may be reserved and pint-sized but those claws do her talking. She demonstrates her savagery when she beheads the Goliath-like henchman sent to seize her.""Logan"" boasts several exciting confrontations as Wolverine and Laura make mincemeat out of an overwhelming number of adversaries. The beauty of these scenes is that the hapless enemy doesn't have a clue about their impending demise. Mangold and company generate one surprise after another as Wolverine and Professor Xavier flee from Pierce and his legion of hooligans on a road trip. Laura accompanies them and earns their respect as a devastating killing machine, and her combat scenes are extraordinary. Eventually, new nemesis Dr. Xander Rice (Richard E. Grant of ""Hudson Hawk""), who wants the children captured, loosens his ultimate secret weapon X-24 that battles Wolverine to a virtual stalemate. The avalanche of tragic events that accumulate as ""Logan"" spirals toward its twilight of the gods ending may sadden some moviegoers. Furthermore, the dearth of backstory about the conspicuous absence of the other X-Men qualifies as ""Logan's"" solitary shortcoming. As the wizened Wolverine, Hugh Jackman evokes sympathy. Patrick Stewart fares no less admirable as the dementia-afflicted Professor Xavier who struggles to come to terms with his murky past. Altogether, ""Logan"" is unforgettable! Incidentally, a hilarious skit with Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool serves as a prologue.","

The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!","

So it ends in much the same way it began. He's also taking care of Xavier(Stewart, grumpy and foul-mouthed, and we love it, but still some hope left). They're both dealing with aging, losing control of their abilities. The next generation need their protection. One last ride.Third time's the charm. As close as the second solo outing got, this is what we've wanted from Wolverine right from when we saw him cage-fighting. And with X-23, or Laura(played to perfection by the incredibly talented young Keen), the torch is passed. The way is paved for the X-Force, as well as the New X-Men. This is a slow burn, and a road movie. The action is amazing, using the R-rating for the ferocity and brutality that is called for, never gratuitously. There is not as much of it as in other entries in the series, and if you're not that interested in the characters this studies, you probably won't be that compelled to watch this. You can go into this blind.This has a lot of strong language, and brief nudity, in addition to what I've already described.

This is a film about a nihilistic lead character and the ugly violent events, that seem to envelop his life like a dark, perpetual gloom. Indeed, what most defines this film is endless, bloody violence. So much so that the simple story of redemption that's supposed to lift the viewer up is obscured and for the most part, silenced. What you are left with, is a rather depressing film, that, sucked dry of any real sense of hope, staggers towards its inevitable demise. Four out of ten from me.","

"Logan","p-jonsson","21 July 2017","I believe that I am about to disagree with quite a few people now. You see, I did not like this movie.Not that this came as much of a surprise to me. What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.For me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.Wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.The entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go (censored) themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.The bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X- Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of ""enhanced"" humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.By the way, why the (censored) do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?The story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.The movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.","

"Logan","Toph-22","21 March 2021","If you look at the X-Men series, 'Logan' stands out very clearly from its predecessors. It's more brutal, more melancholic, and confines itself to the essentials.You realize relatively quickly in which world Logan lives, in a harsh, doomed world. The excesses of violence serve as a deliberate stylistic device to show what it's really like to fight for survival. Logan himself says that reality is not comparable to what is shown in comics.There are occasional references to comics in the film. Of course, this is fanservice in a way, but I found it very fitting and helped to show this contrast between the ideal superhero world and the harsh reality.The slow narrative pace, the dreary world, the dialogues and emotions reduced to a minimum can unfold their effect on the viewer. In terms of genre, the movie is reminiscent of a modern western in many places. Logan has never been known for his emotional outbursts or witty humor. He has now come to terms with the fact that his life is different from that of ""normal"" people. He's used up and that's exactly what you notice from the first minute.'Logan' represents a worthy end for Wolverine, or for Hugh Jackman in his parade role. I can't imagine, in the best sense of the word, that there will be an actor in the future who can embody this role better.'Logan' is, for me, one of the best superhero movies out there.","

"Logan","fcabanski","22 June 2017","Notice the positive reviews of this and every other XMen/Wolverine  movie. They all claim ""masterpiece"", ""the best superhero movie  eveeeeeeeeeeeer"", and ""this is how you make a superhero movie"".  The positive reviews are canned, scripted, generated by publicists.  This movie wants to be Terminator. It even uses similar music as the  perfect killing machine stalks a little girl protected by the imperfect  killing machine.  Like other Boreverine movies, this one takes away Wolverine's healing  because the writers don't know how to handle it. The Wolverine from the  comic books is weakened and supposedly humanized. But what's left is a  Wolverine bereft of what makes him super and bereft of all emotion.  Can we get a superhero movie that's about a hero?","

"Logan","andyajoflaherty","4 April 2021","A complete tonal shift from all previous X-Men films and is all the better for it - this film follows an aging Logan as he cares for Charles Xavier, and finds himself protecting a young girl who shares his powers. What follows is a far more grounded approach, with much more mature dialogue, character interactions and some pretty brutal violence. The film also has a lot of heart. I knew this film had been highly praised going in, and it did not disappoint. A high point to say farewell to both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart playing these characters, and hopefully there will be more superhero films like this in the future. Brilliant.","

No person would ever take those decisions. I have not read these comic that this ""new"" old wussifed Logan/wolverine is based on,but based on this movie,I haven't really missed out on anything.If you take out the mutant element of this movie,it's your average generic slow burner drama ,with a hint of action.Long dragged out dialogue,with no real purpose. Half spoken sentences.And of course the anti hero, who makes all the wrong decisions that makes a B movie. 4-5 times Logan could have easily killed the main antagonist, and just ended the whole pursuit and killing of innocent.But every time he runs away instead,just so you can have the final show down.And even than he fights like a girl I was actually hoping someone would just put him out of his misery","

"Logan","randomStuff101","6 August 2017","Bleak, with occasional entertaining moments and action.Not as good as previous X-Men movies. Writing is simpler. Very early it becomes obvious where the story is going. The little girl is good, and does provide some needed unique action. She's a copy in some ways of Hitgirl from Kick-Ass, similar age and similar level of violence. Fight scenes were mostly about ""killing anonymous bad guys"" with various styles of stabbing blades through different entry points. Much like a video game, bad guys never learn that approaching a mutant with only a gun is not the best strategy, but they keep coming.No doubt there's entertainment here, and a keen fan base will lap it up. Many will be happy enough with what's on offer. In the end, it's just a movie, so who cares. It's a solid 5 or 6 out of 10.","

"Logan","view_and_review","5 March 2017","Bravo.Encore! Encore!This is what Wolverine is about, this is the Wolverine movie I'd been waiting for.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was alright. ""The Wolverine"" was about just as mediocre, but this... this was a masterpiece. This had depth, this had feeling, this had character.Logan is an older, disheveled, drunker, surlier character with diminishing abilities. He is rock bottom. Probably not the ideal Wolverine but it makes his character so much more layered. This is a Wolverine you will be familiar with but maybe slightly impatient with as well. But one thing is for sure, this movie (hence Wolverine) benefited from an R rating. It wasn't an R rating just for the sake of cheap sexual jokes or gratuitous nudity, rather it was an R rating in order for Wolverine to be Wolverine: a cutthroat killer that uses his claws for more than just neatly puncturing people. As for Charles Xavier, he is older and suffering from the effects of old age which has diminished his abilities as well as made him highly volatile. They are alone with hardly any mutants left and not much more to live for--that is until a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes into their lives.Dafne Keen is wonderful as the little Laura. She has limited lines but she commands the screen nonetheless. She was both adorable and formidable and an indispensable part of the story line.If you're looking for non-stop action, this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for a good story with structure and pace and some well placed potent action, then this is for you. The movie may have been slow for some, but I'm an adult and I can tolerate a slow movie that has a purpose. This was so much grittier and realler than just about any comic book/superhero movie. There was no saving the world, no saving the galaxy, not even saving a small town, but there was saving--and there was sacrifice. I love the movies that aren't afraid to make us angry or make us sad. Not the cheap anger that comes with every bad guy, or the cheap sadness that comes with the death of a good guy. I mean those movies, such as this one, that can cultivate and build to make an authentic anger and an authentic sadness. Not everyone can be saved, not everyone lives happily ever after and not everyone changes for the better. We try to reach those in need of saving--both literally and figuratively--but some people you can't reach. This movie had that.I could wax on much longer about this film I love it so much. For the sake of brevity I will conclude with this: Logan is that superhero movie done so well that the super abilities are second to the super story.","

I watched it so that I can follow the mythology of X men, but if they keep on making crap like this I think I will stop watching. The movie is just violent, and the characters are just into violence. There's no action. Only violence. The characters are only there to perpetuate violence, and I didn't like that at all. Maybe a little more plot and story telling next time. But for me I don't think there is no next time.","

"Logan","sktraut","15 August 2019","No punches pulled in this one. All the fat is trimmed from the regular, ensemble X-men, end of the world plots that bogged down previous entries in the franchise. The action is realistic and the characters behave like real people instead of just vehicles for superpowers. The choice to focus on just two of the previous mutants, Logan and Charles, catalyzes the chemistry between them. Above all it celebrates what makes these movies entertaining: they aren't blessed with powers, they're cursed with mutations.","

Claws out, SNIKT!Speaking of which... in this poorly edited flick, we have two Mutants that saved the world, the very universe, and everything in between time and time again, yet everyone acts like they are in cheesy Jean- Claude Van Damme road-movie.Our main protagonist, everyone's favorite claw-wielding Mutant gets the clichéd-has-been-hero treatment. Awesome? Not really because the whole thing unfolds every bit as lame as you could imagine.This creatively bankrupt paint-by-numbers production stretches the 5'3"" Wolverine to 6'3"". Invisible stilts anyone? Hollywood's version of Wolverine in ""Logan"" doesn't have much in common with the Marvel comics character, besides sharing the same name.The pathetic ending, after the clichéd showdown with the doppelganger really had me scratching my head. This definitely isn't the Wolverine from the comics. Instead it's Hollywoods pale rip off for monetary gain.The only ray of light here was Patrick Stewart's solid performance, who always delivers in his roles.Ever since the seventies Stan Lee wanted to see his superheroes make a living in Hollywood, but ultimately by doing so Marvel sacrificed all integrity and identity.To all longtime X-Men Comic fans, do yourself a favor stay away from this awful bastardization. It's devoid of any creative substance or even a hint of brilliance.","

"Logan","bob the moo","30 July 2017","This film has had a lot of praise, and I think most of it is deserved. However there is an element where comic book movies generally are not consistently interesting or engaging enough, so whenever one comes along that offers a bit more then we go for it; certainly I know I have enjoyed some of them more than they probably warranted on this basis. With Logan it is that there are consistent touches of maturity, character, and plotting which make it something that I actually cared about. There was scope for much more of this, and it was a shame the characters did not have more quiet moments in between the violence, but there were enough to make us feel for the characters and their relationships.I am not sure that the father/daughter side of things plays out as impacting as it could have, but certainly the relationship between Logan and Xavier is rewarding in its moments. These elements add to a feeling of grit, hopelessness, and grind, which the characters fit and the film embraces. I particularly enjoyed the consequences, the action had heft and impact and major characters suffer and die as it goes ahead. I will borrow a line from another commenter and say that the action scenes are justified or ""earned"" by this base, because they don't just feel like mindless spectacle (even if they are very well done).While Logan is not as good as the high praise suggests, it does offer a lot of darkness, character, violence, engagement, and entertainment – very much worth seeing and it does stand above what the majority of this genre is doing.","

"Logan","Puroo","2 April 2021","When we have an established movie franchise, things start getting a little monotonous - There's a bad guy who's out to destroy everything the hero stands for, then the hero fights and stops him to save the day. We get happy, cheer for the hero, and later forget all about it. But what if we were once told that the hero we are all cheering for is not there to stay forever? He will die, the new generation will come up, they will remember him for some years and eventually he will be forgotten until someone brings up his topic again.This is exactly what happens in this movie. Unlike the high budget movies Marvel has been making like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, X-Men or Fantastic Four, this one takes place in a grim, dark near future. Everything The X-Men ever stood for has gone. Now it's just an ailing Charles Xavier and Logan, who's working as a limousine driver. They are no longer interested in the adventures they had. There was even a point where Logan sees an X-Men comic and dismisses it saying these are just fake stories. He doesn't care about a legacy, but Charles still does.Logan later meets his daughter, who is to be the next Wolverine. She is in trouble, and Logan must help her cross the border before they get caught. One by one Professor X, and then Wolverine, are killed to ensure his daughter and her friends are safe. The movie finally ends with a realisation that no matter what happens, the cycle of life will carry on whether it's humans or mutants. Everything that is born has to die someday. The same X-Men who we once cheered for in the movies will no longer be with us, and neither will we be to tell your tales if you keep them to yourself.","

"Logan","rrkawase","16 May 2017","The movie is a train-wreck from beginning to end. There's hardly a plot in the movie. In fact, here's the story line in one tweet-sized sentence:Wolverine escorts a mutant little girl from Mexico to Canada and everyone dies on the way, including himself. Since there's no story line, I will point out a few non senses: 1) There's no explanation why Wolverine, Prof. X and Caliban are hiding in the desert. Where are all the other mutants? Suddenly there's no one else.2) Prof. X was a wealthy man how did they end up with nothing.3) Prof. X is supposed to be the greatest brain in the world, thus he should be able to control his own ""brain"" diseases. 4) The most ridiculous part is the depiction of ""future"". The only futuristic thing in the whole movie is the self- driving/autonomous highway trucks. However, in the movie they are road-killers, bashing everything on their way. The trucks just run wild at max speed ignoring traffic. I am amazed that there was no quality control on terrible ideas whatsoever. Seriously, they had no one reviewing the sketches before shooting it?5) A wolverine Clone pops out of nowhere, and without any explanation. The comics might explain but the director should have kept in mind this is a stand alone movie.6) Everyone dies. Literally, everyone (except the kids, but that's because children death is hardly accepted by any audiences).7) Non trained nurses are responsible for freeing the mutants from a super high security facility.8) The nurse wants to take the kids to ""eden"", just because she saw in a comic book. The kids actually go there and meet in the coordinates given in the comics. Meaning that, someone wrote the comics for that. But who? Who needs an explanation? Anyway, at this point I though the plot was a cheap rip-off from the series Heroes. 9) All the mutant kids have super powers and they seemed pretty well combat-trained. How a bunch of dudes with guns are able to capture them again and again?10) Finally, the ""bad"" corporation that are hunting the mutant kids, are exploding, shooting and killing everyone on their way. It is ridiculous to think that once they reach the border limits with Canada they would accept defeat: ""Oh man, the kids crossed the border, there's nothing we can do, they won""","

"Logan","classicsoncall","26 March 2017","This was an unusual comic book based story in as much as we get to see popular characters grow old, feel useless, and watch the world pass them by, seemingly with no purpose or logic. So when Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) dies, it just feels wrong considering his importance to the Marvel universe. Then, with the passing of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) himself, I didn't know what to think. The scene didn't leave room for any other interpretation, or some logical way for the character to be resurrected for future consideration, unless one were to have a retrospective story.Leading up to those events though, you had your classic Wolvie battle scenes against a host of formidable Reavers led by a relentless guy named Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). The new kid Laura (Dafne Keen) played her role like she was made for the part, and I have to admit, she creeped me out with her feral look and the way she skulked around the early part of the story. When she first spoke though, her voice had a sharp juxtaposition to her otherwise stoic character, almost sounding as if she were dubbed. I guess I expected a deeper voice for the new mutant.In accord with the somber mood of the story, I missed seeing Marvel comic creator Stan Lee in a cameo appearance, and the absence of an after credits scene was a downer. But then again, it seemed the movie was about endings and not new beginnings. The X-Men tribute at the finale was creatively done, but I'd rather that the story had left things on a more positive note.","

He has to take care of Professor Xavier and earn a living by driving a limousine, until the day when he meets a woman with a young girl pleading for his help.""Logan"" is certainly different from any other X Men related films, because it does not show much supernatural abilities. It is a bloody kill fest, showing a very downbeat and almost hopeless side of a former superhero. The story is quite slow in the first half, and actually the second half as well. I keep thinking that the film should be ending, but it just keeps going on and on. The change in the girl's behaviour at the end is quite annoying, as she should really have acted like that right in the first place, rather than saving it until so late. Is she doing that just for comic effect? I don't know, but it turns out to be annoying to me.If it was not for the spectacular performance of the girl, who looks calm, cool and ruthless all at once, the film would have been rather lackluster. I unfortunately have to conclude that it is not as amazing as they say.","

"Logan","wgeddings","5 March 2017","I wanted to like this movie but the longer it went, the more I disliked it. I can only think how much better this movie would have been if Marvel had made it and done the story right. The good is that the acting is very good and Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deliver great performances as you would expect from them. Stephen Merchant was great as Caliban. Dafne Keen was the true find as she did an outstanding job as Laura (X-23). Not speaking for most of the film means she had to rely on facial expression and looks and she did them with a lot of skill. Whether it was her or just great direction, the point is that she executes her role wonderfully. She has very expressive eyes and at times reminded me of a very young Sandra Bullock. I hope she has a long career. The bad is the typical problem when Marvel isn't making the movie. Apparently the desire is to make superhero movies where the superheros detest their powers and stay far away from lame things like costumes (ie what fan like). So of course there are no costumes in this and there is a lot of complaining about having fantastic powers and everyone seems to determined use kung fu rather than actually use those powers. At several points, it seemed that someone in Hollywood got an idea and insisted that it be included (hey let's involve border crossings, hey we need to say something about big corporations, hey let's complain about self-driving cars, etc. etc.) which all just muddle the story and add nothing in my opinion. Although his acting was as good as always, I found Prof. X a distraction in the movie and was disappointed with his storyline. Others may disagree. This movie is rated R. There are some bloody scenes but there are a lot of F-Bombs. Despite the rating, we had a 9 year old Wolverine fan sitting behind us constantly asking his parent what this or that means. With Wolverine being such a child-friendly character in comics and cartoons, making an R rated version was a pretty bad idea since a lot of kids are going to want to see it and give their parents plenty to have to explain. Deadpool could do it since Deadpool is not that common with kids. In fact, the best part of the movie was the preview (kind of preview) for the upcoming Deadpool sequel. This was the 3rd movie I have seen recently in the theaters where the audience was disruptive. Talking, cell phones, etc. (one guy even taking a phone call during the film!) made it a bad experience. I love seeing movies in a theater but if people cannot learn that when in a theater they are NOT in their own den watching Netflix, I will have to seriously rethink it. Ticket prices keep going up and up and highly disruptive customers (forget poor films) make a good explanation for why people are staying away from theaters.","

We are left with little to no information of the occurrences beyond X-Men Days of Future Past. While that movie ended with hope this begins in despair. Almost like mad max most of the beginning is some desolate wasteland. Charles Xavier is kept away from others due to his seizures that inadvertently (*hinted*) have killed all his X-Men. Wow. Could that just get any worse? How about watching 2 hours of a little girl fight and destroy in all the ways you keep hoping Logan (The Wolverine) would get into gear. Wait. And Wait.... Oh last 20 minutes. There you go. Done. Depressing Close. Movie over. To watch the performance of the actors - magnificent performances and it's not the actors fault for the bad writing, the plot-holed story line, or the absolute depressing overtone throughout most of the movie. I understand we're all bound to get old, to eventually be just as broken and pathetic as these heroes were on screen. But honestly stomaching almost 2 hours of despair, hopelessness, and slow death. Like watching a loved one suffer in pain and unable to do much. It's almost heartbreaking. While I ""hail to the King"" of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) they performed wonderfully and truly brought their characters to life. However, they unwittingly brought them to a most pathetic end. The millions of ways they could've ended this, or re-wrote this, or done anything with. And they made this garbage. I will never keep this one in the collection despite their amazing performance. (Same with Wolverine Origins) Way to undo everything you fixed in DOFP. C'est la vie - Next!","

"Logan","lasttimeisaw","25 June 2017","This gore-permeated, pathos-riddled final chapter of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine trilogy startles its audience with not one, but two curtain calls of iconic characters in the X-Men franchise, and director James Mangold (whose previous Wolverine vehicle is a styled but ultimately self-defeating oddity) ensures that his R-rated version will do something very different from other CGI-heavy products of Marvel cinema, where emotion vacuum has been repeatedly desensitized in favor of visual bombardment. The scale is relatively small (no metropolitan city is threatened by impending danger), set in 2029 where mutants have been almost extinct (the reasons beyond that are both a woe of Professor X and a progressive measure from dietary intake), a world-weary Logan (Jackman), now moonlights as a limo chauffeur, traveling to-and-fro between USA and Mexico, to take care of a delirious Professor X, aka. Charles Xavier (Stewart), a mumbling nonagenarian and episodically inflicted by seizure and is unable to keep a tight rein on his psionic superpower, can only be tamed by medication, meanwhile the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant, a bug-eyed phantom actually has a golden heart) is Logan's sole help. All Logan wants is to save enough money and buy a boat so that they can live in the sea while the rest of the world stays out of harm's way, because the blast induced from Charles' seizure has already caused disastrous collateral damage to those in the vicinity, but the advent of a Mexican nurse Gabriela (Rodriguez) and her so-called teenager daughter Laura (a commendable debutante Keen) will eventually sabotage his plan. It turns out, Laura is very much like Logan, she is a man- made mutant using Logan's own DNA by Doctor Rice (E. Grant), who takes a vocation to capitalize on mutation to manufacture killing machines, Laura is one of his experiments, but now, along with other mutant children, they are failed guinea pigs needs to be disposed of, since Rice has something much more advanced created. So, reluctantly, Logan embarks on his final adventure to escort Laura (along with Charles) to the meeting place, then with other escapees, to cross the border into Canada, where Eden, a mutant paradise purportedly exists (the metaphor of breaking away from USA today is right on the nose), at the meantime, they are hunted by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce (Holbrook, manage to pull off a clichéd role with verve and bemusing ambiguity), a huge fan of Wolverine's legend but also ruthlessly committed to his mission, but he is not the biggest problem for the fleeing trio. Incredibly, Mangold thrusts a brilliant human touch into the story arc, not the least is the moving Western nostalgia eliciting from George Steven's SHANE (1953) and that soul-stirring denouement when Logan is again, regretfully, embroils an innocent family into his war; yet keeps the action sequences snappy, utilitarian but uncompromisingly lethal, that introduction set piece of Laura's destructive nature and combatting prowess is such a godsend. Hugh Jackman will be forever beloved for this role, which he has been playing for 17 years, and here he is even more manifestly touching in ramming home Logan's cursed kismet with unrelenting taedium vitae, which is countervailed by Keen's perfect embodiment of innocence and dispassionateness, slowly eroded when a father-daughter bond starts to burgeon, effectively reaches its crescendo in the coda where a sort of patricide passes on the baton to the offspring. Patrick Stewart, meantime, is equally poignant appearing for the last time as the aging Professor X, his valediction is every bit as potent as Logan's. Also worth mentioning that there is also a noir-version of the film, which is entirely in Black-and- White and makes great play of the story's tragic/heroic tone, when all is said and done, LOGAN is another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation (after DEADPOOL of course) on the big screen, but in its core, it is an ardently past-honoring action-er doesn't shirk from the grim fate but also sows its seeds of hope with great dexterity, to a point that we won't even begrudge to bid farewell to our favorite screen heroes, distinguished by their superpower but permanently scourged by its distasteful corollaries.","

"Logan","kinoreview","2 April 2017","Logan certainly delivers in terms of hacking, slashing and stabbing, but the wounded bear routine of the titular character wears pretty thin. Logan is the antihero stock character very much in the brooding, world weary style of John Rambo. The zenith of the cliché occurs when Logan remarks that familiar tortured line: 'Everyone I care about gets hurt'. Jackman does transcend the limitations of his character with moments of raw emotion, but these are few and far between. The rest of the performances are fine, passable; although I would have liked to see Richard E. Grant chew some scenery. If you're going to cast a British baddie, let him go full blown Gary Oldman - what this bleak spectacle sorely needs is some charisma. Alas, the bland characterisation isn't saved by the narrative, which follows a monotonous cat-and-mouse formula that's bereft of any suspense. A viewing of 'No Country For Old Men', a preeminent cat-and-mouse film, will remind you just how tiresomely loud and noisy 'Logan' is.What we have then is a dumb and decidedly average action film with a filter stripped right from Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' video and a litany of brutally repetitive fight scenes.","

"Logan","TxMike","3 November 2017","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. In an interesting addition it has a second disk, of the B&W version of the movie. I will add a note at the end of this after I have time to view it.I have always liked the Wolverine character in the X-Men movies, he is played with the right amount of superpower mixed with angst. This movie is set in the near future, 2029, and Hugh Jackman is back as Logan. (Later in the movie we also see him as a clone, X-24.) Patrick Stewart is back as Charles, aging and delicate, and Logan is caring for him, the X-Men days a distant memory. Until someone shows up looking for Charles and a new mutant.That mutant, one remnant of a series of illegal experiments to grow super soldiers, is little Dafne Keen as approximately 10-yr-old Laura. She has super strength and also the embedded knives in her hands. Before the story is over we find out Logan is in fact her biological father.The movie has a number of scenes with extreme violence and gore, and some vehicle chase scenes, those are virtually mandatory in modern movies. But the story itself is a nice one, the surviving young mutants need to get to a particular place in N. Dakota to seek safe refuge in Canada.I was particularly impressed with the young actress, her character was for me the highlight of the movie.Edit: I popped in the B&W version of this movie and viewed several scenes. I must say it is excellent, the lighting and appropriate contrast make it pop nicely gives it an air of mystery. If I had only watched the movie in B&W I would be totally happy with that. I know some prefer B&W as it gives them the ""cinema"" look they enjoy but for me a well-filmed color movie is still better. Color is very important to our reality so why leave it out?","

"Logan","sean-curtin-517-748378","7 March 2017","This is without doubt, the saddest Marvel release EVER!!! Who ever wrote this should be taken out and shot at dawn and all the money they were paid should be put into a charity fund for the homeless(more to the point to fund poor writers who could have run rings around the untalented butt clowns that wrote this travesty of biblical proportions).The previous X-men films have all been top notch, high quality efforts that have not only been faithful to the comics that made them possible but have been well written with super acting and masterful story telling.This mess of a film has ruined so much of what I liked about the original X-Men films that this fan is not going to spend money going to see any more X-men films at the movies. I'm that upset about this rubbish.The most important thing about Super Hero style movies is that people like this fan, go to see HEROES WIN AND SAVE THE DAY. I'm sorry if a few unmentionables can't handle that or find the concept trite or boring etc, but the world needs Super heroes, not super loosers.The only saving grace of this film was the young troupe of new mutants(genetically engineered mutants). Sadly as I hope your getting the idea, the whole concept ruins the ideas that came before and more to the point Wolverine(I'm not going to call this character by the name that belongs to this terrible movie ever again), totally destroys the place of his origin. Zip, NADA, nothing left folks, so this whole story is a complete pile of badly written 'what if' at best.Don't let this be the first (and last) X-Men film you ever see. Skip this one and enjoy the glorious other movies that Marvel has put out. This movie was so bad, they didn't even have a snippet clip at the end of the movie(even Marvel must have realised it would be wasting it's time doing so with this one, because most of the people in the cinema I saw it in, walked out as soon as the credits started rolling and all I heard where numerous comments about how bad they found the movie).So no spoilers to give on this one fellow movie fans because the entire movie is a spoiler. A spoiler for some of the greatest super hero movies ever made and should be avoided like the plague.","

Slooow to kick off, lots of repetitive violence of the same kind, little emotional attachment to any character (especially the girl, who spends most of her time either doing bugger all or making holes in people's heads, shoulders, knees and toes), a plot so compromised Logan himself couldn't make any more holes in it with his pointy bits. One very annoying technical aspect was the cheap lens they used that created really noticeable parallax distortion every time the operator pulled focus. Made me feel ill. Have you noticed that any Marvel film gets highly rated on IMDb - I'm convinced they employ lots of kids in bedrooms to submit fake reviews.","

"Logan","dannyc-18","4 March 2017","I just finished watching Logan and--oh my God--what a dismal, dreary, dreadful and dumb bit of cinematic nihilism that was. Brutally and graphically and disturbingly violent too.All those tremendous adventures the X-Men had in years past? All the times they defeated evil villains? The camaraderie, the sense of family--of a home for misfit mutant kids? The risks and victories and sacrifices? Yeah, it was all ultimately meaningless.I can understand if they felt they needed to kill off the old X-Men but they did so in such a way as to make every previous X-Men movie and story appear to have been a foolish exercise in futility. A miserable and lonely future awaits, addled and alcoholic, only to be relieved by violent death. Yay.This could have been an uplifting homage to the ideal of what the X-Men were. But Hugh & Patrick & Co. apparently decided they would rather go out with a sad whimper instead of a celebratory bang.","

"Logan","Wuchakk","22 April 2017","Released in 2017 and directed by James Mangold, ""Logan"" takes place in 2029 when loner Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is a weary Uber driver near the border in West Texas. No new mutant has been birthed for 25 years and Wolvie lives with the Alzheimer's-suffering Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the albino mutant-tracking Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border. After a mysterious new mutant girl enters the picture (Dafne Keen), Logan, Xavier and the lass flee for possible sanctuary in North Dakota hounded by a malevolent security team from the dubious corporation in which the girl originated. Donald Pierce plays the arrogant cybernetics-enhanced chief of security.This is the third and arguably the best Wolverine movie, although I slightly prefer 2009's underrated ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2013's ""Wolverine"" was okay, but overall meh). ""Logan"" focuses on aging & death contrasted by new birth and the potential thereof. For a superhero flick, it's gritty realistic with compelling drama & characters and an entertaining road trip, not to mention loads of hard R-rated violence. The movie explores the possibilities of what would happen when high-powered mutants become aged and diseased.Some of classic Marvel Comics' best moments were when one of their superheroes, e.g. The Thing or The Black Panther, was thrust into an everyday scenario, like talking to regular folks on the street or shopping at the market. There's a lot of this in ""Logan."" It dares to slow things down and focus on the characters and is the better for it. One of the best extended sequences is the trio's meeting with a hospitable black family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse) after a highway mishap somewhere north of Oklahoma City. This episode is Exhibit A in why ""superheroes"" can't mix with regular folk for too long, for their own welfare.""Logan"" ranks with the best superhero movies because, like 2009's ""Watchmen,"" it dares to be different. It's anything BUT a conventional superhero flick. Unfortunately, it's overlong at 141 minutes. The movie should've ended shortly after the trio's arrival to their destination, with some kind of potent dramatic close. But the filmmakers insisted on tacking on yet ANOTHER action-packed attack by the antagonists and it therefore ends on a tedious, redundant note. Disregarding this caveat, ""Logan"" is a great 'superhero' flick.My favorite mutant, by the way, is the chubby black boy.The film was shot in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Newhall, California; and Pauls Valley & Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The screenplay was written by director Mangold, Scott Frank & Michael Green.GRADE: A-","

Mangold took inspiration from the old man Logan comic and nailed it on the screen. This is not your typical super-hero movie with the world destroying threat but a story about human struggles and personal stakes which made it feel real. A story about a man that has been represented as a animal who now is at a point where he just want to live in peace. It's a mature comic book. This movie has fantastic quiet moments that braces the sympathy each character has for each other. Logan now the only student left to take care of the professor that now suffers from Alzheimers that gives Charles and Logan a harsh relationship. Fantastic movie!","

"Logan","morrison-dylan-fan","15 July 2017","Since seeing X-Men on the last family holiday I had in 2000,the franchise has always been one that has meant more to me than the other comic-book movies. With the son of my best friend being a comic- books fan and also having the name Logan,it felt like the perfect time to see Wolverine for the last time.View on the film:Not saying a single line of dialogue for the first hour of her (film) debut, Dafne Keen gives a remarkable performance as Laura,with Keen clawing at Laura's frustrations and volatile mood swings with an abrasive body language that keeps all on edge. Raising her voice,Keen gives the difficult relationship with Logan a melancholy,which brings out a father/daughter tenderness.Losing 21 pounds for his return to the series,Patrick Stewart gives a great performance as Xavier,whose fragile,dying state Stewart does not allow to rest on pity,by showing that Xavier still has some sparks which opened the school for the X-Men.Playing a role he has done for almost 20 years for the final time, Hugh Jackman gives a superb performance as Logan. Visibly carrying the history of Logan on his shoulders,Jackman gives him a raw fragility, as meeting Laura causes Logan to face his own morality.Working with Jackman for the third time,co-writer/(with Michael Green and a returning to X-Men Scott Frank) director James Mangold & cinematographer John Mathieson continue expand on the action style of The Wolverine with a thrilling,bare-knuckle fury,unleashed with blood darting across the screen and each fight move being delivered with a real thump.Setting it in the future,Mangold and Mathieson draw a Post-Apocalypse,Road Movie landscape,as the dry,dusty colour of the road and a burning red sun cast an end of days atmosphere over the journey.Putting their focus on the trio,the screenplay by Mangold/Frank and Green does keep the ""baddies"" at a boo-hiss level,but does give them enough snarling menace so that they pose an aggressive threat to Logan.Using the wear and tear of Logan to take the ""superhero"" sheen off, the writers explore a wonderfully earthy character study,with the dialogue having a grittiness and an unshakeable air of death keeping everything grounded,as the ultimate X-Men reveal themselves.","

"Logan","El-Ak","22 January 2021","The theme of the film is quickly revealed from the very first scene that it's not like any of the previous X-Men movie as the R rating appears from the very first second and it actually introduced the X-Men universe to the reality dimension.
Acting :⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Everyone in this film was giving another level of performance that we weren't used to from the very same characters. Hugh Jackman did the best performance as Logan in his 17 year long performance and his best performance since his Oscar-nominated performance. The amount of pain and suffer that Logan and Charles went through over the years was expressed by Hugh and Sir. Patrick were priceless and their expressions could deliver a flow of mixed emotions that would hit every X-Men fan right in the heart.
Making her debut as X-23, the wonderful child Dafne Keen gave one of the most strong child performances ever that blow our mind and we wouldn't ask for a better representation for this character.
Score : ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
By Marco Beltrami (who is also the composer of A Quiet place I and II) gave an intense, thrilling and powerful score that added to the greatness of each scene that will make you on the edge of the seat most of the time. The kind of soundtrack that gives you chills.
Cinematography : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By John Mathieson (who is also the cinematographer of Gladiator) was brilliant!! It makes you feel like you are right in the action especially the cars chasing scenes and the camera movements during it. Also the wide shots ( as in photo no. 4) was artistic as it could be. The lightning at some shots was just perfect making the shots at some points as a beautiful painting. The only flaw it had was the decision to shoot some fight scenes (especially the last one) in a single shot to emphasize the brutality and violence in them which the CGI didn't help in.
VFX : ⭐⭐⭐⭐
The visual effects were great but had obvious flops at critical points of the movie especially the last fight scene which was the grand finale of the whole movie which only the brutality, excitement and shock could save.
The plot : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
The story is for sure strong and unique from the other X-Men films and the best among them. It's only enough that it introduced us to a new aspect of the whole X-Men universe and it's quite shocking and powerful events that just won't let you move your eyes of the screen, but it was quite predictable for how it's going to end and sometimes brought exaggerated violence which was at points unnecessary to keep us attracted.
Direction : ⭐⭐⭐⭐½
By the one and only James Mangold, who saved this franchise after the huge flop and disappointment the 1st film gave us. He made us worry whether this film is going to give Wolverine the ending he deserves or not especially that the 2nd film had mixed reactions but he did give us just the movie we were hoping for and even exceeded our expectations at certain points. Every shot of this film is well studied and artistic as it could possibly be creating the great atmosphere and the beauty that comes out of this brutal world making it an immortal film and one of the all time great. A great Job indeed.
A movie that will make you excited, entertained, cry and smile. One hell of a journey it has been.

Soon the bounty hunter Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) meets Logan and asks to help him to find an eleven year-old girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) that is with Gabriela. Logan is contacted again by Gabriela and she asks Logan to drive Laura and her to a place called Eden in North Dakota and she offers to pay for his service. The reluctant Logan accepts the job but Gabriela is murdered. He returns to the place where he lives and finds Laura there with Professor Xavier and Caliban. However Pierce returns with a group and Laura uses abilities similar to Logan to escape with Professor Xavier and Logan, but Caliban is captured by Pierce and his men. While heading to Eden. Logan discovers that Gabriela was a nurse in the Transigen Corporation taking care of children developed with abilities by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). When the Transigen decided to shut down the program and kill the children, Gabriela and the other nurses released them and now Laura intends to join her friends. Will they find the sanctuary?""Logan"" is the swan song of Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier in a dismal, violent and sad film. The plot is totally different from the genre with a dark story and unpleasant hero. The road trip showing two former superheroes protecting a girl with abilities is not original, but the cruel fate of the family that welcomes them in their home is. In the end, ""Logan"" is a well-made film too somber for a comic book adaptation. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Logan""","

"Logan","jadongarcia","7 April 2019","This was the perfect sendoff for Hugh Jackman's most popular character ""James 'Logan' Howlett"" aka 'The Wolverine'. Many might say that there are plot holes with the film that things could have gone different but we as fans must understand the character enough to realize that this is how he was meant to go out as a hero. Not in a happy ""im retiring"" type of sendoff. This film needed the grittiness and dark violent tone because thats just reality for you. Because as depressing Hugh Jackman's character was in this film it was as realistic as James Mangold intended. This is the ninth film starring Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, forget all the plot holes and continuity errors with the timeline. Logan has persevered through everything from all the wars in the 1800-1900's to watching innocent people die, watching Jean(the love of his life) die, watching the professor die twice in two different timelines, the list goes on and yet he can't do anything about it, no matter who he gets vengeance from it'll be pointless in the end because he lost something deep and meaningful. His story arc has come along away, its perfect, he is allowed to be depressed.One of my favorite scenes from the film that has a very deep meaning is when he is talking to X-23 and he is asked what the bullet is and he replies that it is made of the same metal that was used to code both of their endoskeletons, followed by that he says he was going to shoot himself with it, because he knows that he has no intention in living his life any longer because he'll just keep watching innocents and loved ones die.He made the perfect sacrifice and experienced what he had been missing his entire life, and thats the meaning of life itself.","

"Logan","I_Ailurophile","30 March 2021","It's violent, it's very dark, and in the end it's notably depressing. But 'Logan' is also exciting, deeply engrossing, and ultimately unexpectedly fulfilling. And it's quite possibly the single best live-action superhero or comic book movie that has been made to date.The genre was all but reinvented when the Marvel Cinematic Universe launched with the first Iron Man film in 2008, and the MCU has since largely defined the standard for comic book movies. That's a double-edged sword: Every new superhero blockbuster now has to have heroes that are as snarky and sarcastic as they are superhumanly powerful. There's room for humor that is more clever, and for deeply affecting drama, but above all superhero movies must have Action, Action, and more Action to draw in the box office numbers, and a tangled web of world-building to lead into the next projected number of films.It can be enticing, but it also becomes tiresome after a certain point - we can only watch so many protagonists formed from the same mold before the pattern begins to wear thin. In 2017, 'Logan' struck a very different tone that's just one part of what makes it so great and, even now, more lastingly impressive.The opening scene alone gives a peek at how violent and bloody the movie is going to be, and also imparts a bit about our protagonist before we even get the full picture. The man called Logan is no longer the powerhouse known as Wolverine. He's noticeably older, he's tired, and he doesn't bounce back from injuries so easily; the abilities he has relied on for many years are failing him. That's only the introduction for a narrative that becomes ever more dour alongside the setting: This is not your typical comic book movie.What follows is partly an examination of mortality, and the consequences of a hard-charging heroic lifestyle, as Logan tries to get by with odd jobs and care for a very ill Charles Xavier. No one else among their recognizable mutant allies, the X-Men, are around any more - it's just them. When Logan is tasked with protecting a young girl, life becomes significantly more difficult.Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor, and for all the times he's portrayed Wolverine on film, none of them can begin to compare to this performance. Patrick Stewart, legend that he is, again turns heads in the role of the man once known as Professor X, but this time it's a much more frail, saddening depiction.The rest of the cast is fine, but extra special commendations must go to young Dafne Keen, appearing in 'Logan' as the mysterious girl Laura. Keen was only 12 years old when this film premiered, but she lights up the screen and handily steals the spotlight away from the bigger names on the bill. The first time that Laura shows who she is, and bursts into action, Keen lets loose with a bombastic, feral rage that makes the scene absolutely electrifying, and almost a little startling for how very visceral it is. She shows more range as the picture goes on, especially at the finale, and impresses upon us right away that she is a talent to be reckoned with. One can only hope we get to see many more features with Keen in the future, because she is outstanding.'Logan' is exciting and suspenseful, but it's also a bit of a punishing watch. In following our aging protagonist, the film forces viewers to recognize their own mortality. For all his abilities, and all the things he has done, Logan is no longer the person he once was, and to continue to push himself to the same limits may actually break him. At the same time, the minor focus on Xavier complements that mirror by showing us a man who is losing himself, and losing control of his faculties - yet who is no less powerful, and therefore a danger to both himself and those around him. As much as 'Logan' is filled with action to satisfy fans of superhero movies, it is also highly suffused with sorrow, frustration, regret, and a hurt that runs deeper than the most grievous wound.As heavy as the narrative is in its themes, we're still not done. The X-Men, as an intellectual property, has always been a thinly-veiled metaphor for the queer community, with substantial emphasis on the persecution, ostracism, and prejudice levied against people just because of who they are. The focus on these themes have perhaps lessened over time as attitudes in society have shifted. Yet as the means used to target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or otherwise queer folks have changed, story beats in the comics and movies have changed, too. 'Logan' doesn't shy away from the subtext as the narrative also includes mention of genetic engineering that echoes real world concerns: mapping the human genome means better understanding of the diversity of our species, but the knowledge also presents a danger of being used to alter people before they're even born.Many other superhero movies dabble in sociopolitical topics; 'Logan' bathes in them. Many other superhero movies give a passing glance at the human condition; 'Logan' is laser-focused on it. I repeat: This is not your typical comic book movie.It's simply a bonus that 'Logan' stands on its own, independent of other films. One doesn't need to have seen other pictures featuring Wolverine to appreciate this one. One doesn't even need to have background on who the X-Men are to appreciate this, though it does help and adds significant context. As long as violence is no object, this is a movie that anyone could enjoy.My interest in comic book films has waned considerably over time, and only periodically will one come around that truly piques my interest. 'Logan' falls into the genre thanks to its source material, but it refuses to follow the established formula; you will not find any shots here that accentuate the imposing heroic stature of the protagonist. The thrilling action is intense, but so is the arresting drama. 'Logan' is a superhero movie like no other, and I don't expect we'll see another like it any time soon.Essential viewing, for comic book fans and for general audiences alike. I don't want a glut of films copying what 'Logan' has done, but action blockbusters could definitely stand to learn a lot from this.","

Director James Mangold (who co-wrote with Scott Frank & Michael Green) enfuses the franchise spin-off with some new insights and a damn well pay dirt in going very dark and very graphically (and wholeheartedly welcome) unleashed violence. At its heart is literally that - heart, surprisingly well-crafted and executed particularly with dynamo Keen (a cross between The Road Warrior's Feral Kid and Kick-Ass' Hit Girl) gloweringly lethal.","

Was never explained and made no sense.Anti logan character being able to slice through metal like butter with adamantium blades, later girl with adamantiumblades needs multiple hits to chop through wood.Why is logan not healing exactly? He's getting older but in the comics logan just lives like 300 years something and our logan isnt that old and should still be able to heal.Kids talking rhetorically so advanced like they are well in their 30s.Villain explaining his masterplan for no reason just to give characters enough time to make a move.Villain poisoned the food, water all around the earth for decades to get rid of Mutant births. Nice plan.Girl that spontaniously learned to talk spontaniously can drive a car.Logan gets impaled by adamantium blades and is fine, later gets impaled by wood and dies.Mutant kids with insane powers like freeze, shackle, lightning or telekinesis cant stop one raging logan clone to save the real logan.I dont have logan claws but if I had I would use them better, the amount of ineptitude either characters puts into the world is beyond me and some of them had what? A century of experience? yep...aaaand the Best ONE:Trucks in the future are portrayed as self driving vehicles, but are their tip is flat so they are completely non aerodynamic. Premium Quality Physics.Well yes I cant say much good about this movie apart from the acting of our protagonist and relatively little woke culture. So naturally I wanted to quit many times during the film but since I had seen all the other Xman movies years ago and this came on Netflix I had o finish it.thanks for reading if you are the kinda person triggered by plotholes, see another movie.

"Logan","namashi_1","3 March 2017","The third and final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013), 'Logan' is the darkest & also THE most brutal X-Men film to date. Director James Mangold & Lead-Star Hugh Jackman returning for one last time as Logan/Wolverine, deliver a superhero film, that's Super in its truest sense. The one's an emotional, gruesome, gritty & powerful film, that holds your attention, despite excessive violence. Faint-Hearts please stay away, but those who relish Hardcore stuff, Grab A Ticket Now!'Logan' Synopsis: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.'Logan' explores very less of Wolverine's journey, its all about Logan this time. 'Logan' is a character study of a superhero finally off his prime & facing enemies who are stronger than him. Even his life may end, for someone to whom immorality was certain. And that's exactly why 'Logan' works so hugely. The narrative is about Logan's constant fight to survive as well protect his mentor & a young mutant, who's on the run. The villains are ruthless & Logan's fight against them, is clap-worthy.The Violence is too much though. I'm not complaining here, I mean a superhero with claws so sharp can't be projected with fake juicy blood, but the bloodshed here is rather disturbing. Whenever there is action up on screen, its brutal & unforgiving. The finale, particularly, is no-holds-barred. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you, dear faint-hearts! The biggest triumph of 'Logan' is its emotional connect. Logan & the young mutant girl, share a wonderful relationship here, as does Profresser Xavier. The connect among them, despite all the brutality around, forms 'Logan' in its entirety. I was engrossed & even concerned about Logan & Co. here, I was connected with them & was rooting for them when they fought the evil-heads.Scott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green's Screenplay is intense & engaging. Its all-out brutality, with strong emotional undercurrents. The Writing, though predictable at times, is thoroughly arresting. Mangold's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with authority. Cinematography & Editing are very good. Action-Sequences/Stunts are spectacular & pushes the 'R Rating' with force. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Graphics are top-class. Background Score & Make-Up, merit a special mention.Performance-Wise: Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/ Wolverine for one last time & he's in terrific form. Right form his broken body-language, to the aggression he expresses when the claws are out & to the softness he emotes when building a connection with the little girl, Jackman brings fabulous layers to his portrayal. This is the best performance Jackman has delivered being Logan/Wolverine. Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, is remarkable. The Screen Legend adds tremendous depth to the part & shines in every scene he appears in. Dafne Keen as Laura, is a surprise packet. She's electrifying! Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, is menacing to the core. And is it ironic that the chief villain here is named Donald?? Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gabriella, does well in a brief role. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Logan' is Brutal & Brilliant! Two Thumbs Up!","

"Logan","gradyharp","11 June 2017","For those who have been following the Marvel Comic Books cinematic transformation, the character of Wolverine – that hunk with the blades that shoot out from his hands when he is angry – is well known. LOGAN represents the end of Wolverine, and surprisingly this is a very touching film and not just excessive gore (though that is certainly present throughout the film!). One line that underscores the mood of this piece is Logan's line 'Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.' James Mangold directs the story he wrote (transformed into a screen play with help form Scott Frank and Michael Green) with a great deal of empathy for the last of Logan and his return to a caring man.The year is 2029 - the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his sidekick, the albino Caliban (Stephen Merchant) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger (Elizabeth Rodriguez) asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures (led by Boyd Holbrook) working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan. A relentless pursuit begins. This time around we see Wolverine as the superhero beset by everyday problems -aging, ailing and struggling to survive financially. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over. Kindness prevails – as a family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse) provide caring and protection for Wolverine and his mutant daughter. The evil trackers are very well portrayed, the action is brisk, but underneath all the killing and mutilation is a story with a heart. Grady Harp, June 17","

"Logan","errant-52785","23 February 2021","For over 30 years, the X-Men have been the concept, fictional characters, stories, genre IP, or whatever you want to call it, closest to my heart and my soul.When the first two films came out, I was in awe that they had gotten so close, as close as I could ever expect, to bringing them to life onscreen. Time and comparisons of what has come since have not been kind. The series has had its ups and downs. And they had to start somewhere in creating a universe with a diverse cast of characters and rich storytelling history. But they will always have a special place in my heart.The series had gotten to the point where I haven't even seen the last 3? 4? 6? in a theater upon release.That includes ""Logan."" I'd heard it was good, but I never felt an urgency (or even an urge) to make it a priority to watch, even as I caught up with the other ones. I've been waiting for like 2 years for it to leave FX so I could watch it without commercials. I got over it and watched it on FXNow this weekend, which somehow I still have access to through the cable company even though I don't pay for the TV side?Anyway, I'm glad I waited. Waited for Fox to finish mangling the franchise into whatever b*st*rdized and bowdlerized nonsense they could imagine.This serves as the most fitting capstone and epitaph to the film franchise. Not so much as it was, but for what it could and should have been in more capable, caring, careful hands.And damn, it is a great film. As a film, it may be the greatest single comic ""adaptation"". Including ""The Dark Knight"" which I have always felt is overrated (outside of Heath Ledger's performance). It's not the most satisfying, the most fun, most exciting. But as a film, it takes you exactly where it wants you to go, without any flaws.It made me emotional, obviously, or I wouldn't have written all this for an almost 4 year old movie. And that's not anything new for me and comic book movies. But it made me emotional in ways that none of the others have. Not at the wonder of finally seeing all this on screen. But through the pathos put on screen.","

Or it might just be the fact that Hollywood produces turd after turd and that has lowered our expectations. Either way, the sad reality remains, a simple and unspectacular movie like Logan gets a 8.5.The movie begins at a somewhat slow pace. The more it progresses, the more it starts to get evident that we're not going to be seeing decent special effects. This was produced on the ""cheap"" and has a TV series feel to it. The execution and the sheer scale are not up to par with the other X-men movies, the script is lacking too. The worse part however is that this movie is supposed to give the whole X-men series closure and it does that in a very unspectacular and boring way. They rushed it, probably seeing a good opportunity to slaughter the dying cash-cow, seeing that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart wanted to retire from playing their iconic X-man characters.A big disappointment and a sad ending to an otherwise decent franchise. Can't wrap my mind around the 8.5 mark, I guess a good part of the budget went for paying up the shills.","

The action sequences are amazing and from the opening scene you can tell this will be a superhero movie that is not going to hold back on its action sequences. I do wish Wolverine and X-23 could have done more fight scenes together and complemented each other in combat, yet the scenes were still entertaining. From the emotional relationship to the plot and character of wolverine this film had my interest most of the time. This is a great superhero film that is not like most where it has the need relate to other superheros or other films, but instead has its own movie that excels. A film that reminds me of The Last of Us game and is truly a heartfelt and entertaining film.4.5/5","

"Logan","ironhorse_iv","11 March 2017","Wolverine is one of the few X-Men characters that appears in nearly every media adaptation of the X-Men franchise, including comics, television, and video games. He has always been a popular character. His willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes, for the rest of the late 20th century. As a result, the character was also feature in films, with Australian actor, Hugh Jackman playing him in nine different movies, with 'Logan', supposedly being his last. Directed by James Mangold & set in the near-future, the film follows a past-his-prime James ""Logan"" Howlett AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarking on a road trip across America with his diminished mentor/friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) for one final mission to safety delivered, a young mutant girl, Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) to the protection of the Great White North, Canada; while a group of scientists, and their security team led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) tries to stop them. Without spoiling the movie, too much, director James Mangold and his writers does an OK job, helming this piece in the style of comics, 'Old Man Logan' & 'the New Mutants'. I just wish, he didn't his characters bash the comics, in-universe so much. What's wrong with having Wolverine, wear his iconic yellow suit!? Fans like myself, really do want to see it. It's sad that Hugh Jackman, will never done that suit. It could had made this film, so much better. Also, if this comic book plot sounds very familiar, it's pretty much, is; as the movie and comics, borrow elements from classic westerns such as 1953's 'Shane', 1972's 'The Cowboys' & 1976's 'The Shootist'; as well as story elements from other dystopian mediums hits like author, P. D. James 1992 'Children of Men' novel; which in return, became a movie in 2006; as well as 2013's survival horror video game 'The Last of Us'. All of this, been cited as one of its story's primary influences, even if the film loosely use all of them. Because of that, it kinda diminished the story, a bit, as 'Logan' is place in a future that's not quite post-apocalyptic as 2014's film 'Days of Future Past' timeline, but not quite as normal. So, it was not as intense as it should be. The film also became a bit confusing at times, as parts of the film talks about events like the Liberty Island accident in the original timeline, when technically, they're living in the revised timeline, set for them. It's really doesn't make any lick of sense. It's all f*** up! When, you think about it, 'Logan' has a lot of plot-holes that goes unexplained like Transigen killing mutants, yet, trying to create them. Don't get, where they were going with that. Also, the question who was in Canada, kinda bug me. Maybe, it's the Alpha Flight? Who knows!? The film never tells you. Because of this, the lack of exposition is pretty noticeable, toward the third act. It will leave you, puzzling, yet somewhat confused. Also, whenever, they do spill exposition about what is happening, it's told in the most laziness fashion like the well-made video on the smart phone. Like honestly, who had time to shot the video, and edited it, when it's supposedly smuggle out, quickly!? Also, why didn't Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) just publicize it to the public? That would save time. Another problem for the movie for me, was when they unearth the new villain, X-24. In my opinion, I found the surprised villain to be, jarring and yet, also disappointing. It felt a self-jerk. It was just as awkward as 'Albert' from the comics. It just doesn't mesh for me. The film could had been better, if it had Donald Pierce take that role, since Boyd Holbrook was surprising, pretty good, as the extreme fanboy villain. If not, Donald Pierce. They should had use the character of 'Sabretooth' from 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Actor, Liev Schreiber was one of the best thing about that movie, as Victor Creed. So use him, instead! Despite the scenes with X-24, the rest of the action was alright in this film, even if it's not as bloody or gory as people make it, out to be. Just glad, it's not CGI heavy. I also like how Hugh Jackman still had the chops to do, most of his stunts. It's also cool to see, a young actress like Dafne Keen, be able to stand out on her own, in those fighting sequences as well. I just wish, the movie establish, more of a father/daughter relationship with the two, besides the fighting. I found those driving scenes part, to be below standards, due to the lack of dialogue and interaction between them. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman's performance in this film, but couldn't they had him, lighten up for a few moments. I don't like, how much Logan is a sourpuss. Let the movie had some more fun with him. The film is dark and downer enough. Have some scenes with him, bonding with his kid. For the most part, I enjoy the connection that Logan had with Charles Xavier, more. It seems like they had more of a relationship than Laura and Logan. I found Patrick Stewart's acting to be the best, throughout this film. He really it, took some risk, like losing 21 pounds to look more elderly and ill. That's really intense. He really gives, something new, here, as the sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, mentally deteriorating mentor-figure. You've never this side of him, before. It's sad that this will be his last role as Professor Xavier, as well. Overall: I thought the film was well-made. I have to say, this movie was just decent enough to be, a good finale for Hugh Jackman's run with the character. It's good, but it's not quite cutting edge great.","

"Logan","kikoydaba3","11 August 2019","Barely even a superhero film, Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials and presents them in a powerful and emotionally moving tale about a worn-out man who has to find the hero who existed within him before.Logan has incredible direction. The standout is the R-rated action. All the gore and blood is utilized to visceral effect as the audience is carried from scene to scene following the characters. The western style and overtone of nihilism is perfectly captured by the barrenness and roughness of the production design. The score is a mix of melodies and orchestra capturing the essence of the moments and themes of the film.Character interactions are at the center of the film. The development of the characters are presented through subtle and emotionally resonant dialogue. The minimal dialogue draws the audience to the incredible and moving performances of the cast. Hugh Jackman fully embodies the worn-out hero who lives just to survive and has lost his sense of heroism or purpose of living. His performance draws us into his broken down world where little hope exists. Patrick Stewart, as Professor X, plays the opposite character with lively optimism and enduring hope. Laura, played by Dafne Keen, is the symbol of hope in the film and the vehicle through which Logan changes as a character. Boyd Holbrook, as Donald Pierce, plays the unrelenting villain who chases the protagonists and drives the plot of the film.Logan is not without its message. The film is a critique of unethical human experimentation and it hammers the point that it is more evil when done for the purposes of profit and power. X-Men related characters were created to highlight minority issues and the film is the best adaption of that purpose. It is also about the majority-minority power struggle and how each side acts and reacts against the other.Superhero films as an artform are rare, Logan is one of them.10/10","

"Logan","harry_tk_yung","6 March 2017","Huge Jackman has appeared on the screen 9 times (reportedly) as ""Logan/Wolverine"". While these are primarily in the X-Men franchise, two of the spin-offs have ""Wolverine"" as their title. ""Logan"", the last of the so-called ""Wolverine Trilogy"", is only one thus titled. Intentional or not, this means something. Finally, more emphasis is given to the protagonist as a human being than as a mutant. The opening scene tells all.The year is 2029, as we see Logan dozing off in a luxury car, to which he is the driver, earning a menial living. Four goons try to steal the wheels, and the usual drill ensues, but with something we have never seen before: Logan/Wolverine"" biting the dust under four common goons. Yes, the old ferocity eventually comes back culminating in a display of decapitated heads and disemboweled entrails (earning ""R"" rating for this movie). But the scenario is all too clear: even Logan cannot fight mortality. He is growing old(er) and weak(er).We soon find that the case is even worse for Charles, Professor X (same old Patrick Stewart) who is pushing 90, an invalid under the care of Logan and another mutant, an albino named Caliban (Stephen). Here, I can't help wondering if the Shakespearean reference is perhaps a suggestion that Charles is an alternate version of Prospero, not powerful in old age, but a faint shadow of his former self. Furthermore, without proper medication, he gets occasional psychic seizures that has devastating effect on a radius of maybe a hundred yards: a small earthquake and people frozen in whatever they are doing (visually not unlike when Quicksilver, the speedy X-men mutant, is in action).We then learn that these three are the very last mutants still in existence, the final targets for extermination to make the Earth mutant-free again. But wait, one more appears on the scene, a pre-teen girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) who turns out to be Logan's ""daughter"" under some unusual circumstances: genetically engineered mutant killer utilizing an ordinary woman's womb and Logan's DNA. This is some mad scientist's project on similarly engineered children with various genes from different mutants. However, when these children were subsequently found to be difficult to control, they were written off as a failed experiment. Laura, together with a group of children, managed to escape.This sets the stage of a fugitive road movie, with the what looks like a three-generation family (Charles, Logan, Laura) constantly on the run from the villains who have captured Caliban, forcing him to serve as their tracker. Laura believes in a safe haven called ""Eden"", a theme that you may remember from a few sci-fi movies including ""I am legend"", ""28 days later"" and one of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. The trajectory becomes somewhat predictable but that does not take anything away from the appeal of this movie that is currently ranked #36 in IMDb's top 250.I'll leave the best for last and start with the usual stuff. The action sequences are pleasing to watch (gore notwithstanding), leaning towards choreography rather than CGI. Making you sit straight and try hard not to blink is Laura, four-feet dynamite of a ripper, fiercest of the X-Men ever to grace the silver screen. And then, to give the time-worn Wolverine fight scene a shot in the arm is an old trick, old but still effective: give him an evil doppelganger. Those looking for the usual X-Men action should be more than satisfied.As I mentioned in the outset, Logan is humanized in the movie more than ever before. Very much like what we have in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2006), a touch of domesticity, apparent or real, works magic. When the fugitive trio is welcomed into one night's shelter by a humble, role model of a family, one can almost feel the warmth radiate into the entire cinema. Around the dinner table the host family talk about their prosaic daily life, as well as hopes, fears and aspiration. The protagonists recuperate, with Logan talking about his ""father's"" (Charles) school from which he has run away a few times. Even in the dark of the cinema, I could ""hear"" gleeful smiles spreading over the audience's faces. This is also the time when Laura starts to thaw and soften.Spoiler or not, the end is very much predictable, a tale of sacrifice, redemption and reconciliation. In a way, it is also very much a father-daughter story, the easiest example coming to mind being the ""Taken"" series (Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace as father and daughter). Jackman, Stewart and young up-and-coming Keen all give superb performances.The last words of the movie come from the conclusion of ""Shane"" (1953), Alan Ladd as the protagonist speaking to little boy Joel: ""There is no living with a killing. There is no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. There is no going back"". Cleverly crafted, this is spoken by Laura who has memorized the lines from the movie she saw on TV in a motel room.","

"Logan","alindsayal","12 December 2021","So even though I have watched The New Mutants, I still have a few X-Men films left to watch and the next one is the film Logan and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set in the future and sees an older Wolverine looking after Charles Xavier when a young mutant comes into their lives and force them on the run.Main Character
Hugh Jackman has become famous for playing the role of Logan/Wolverine and in his final appearance in the role he gives his best performance to date. The fact he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here was an injustice as he truly deserved it for a mammoth truly emotional performance. We see a Logan worn down and fed up of life, he struggles throughout the movie and it really feels like the world has caught up with him and he is actually in danger, which has been something X-Men films have struggled with. Also this film having a more mature adult feeling means we finally get to see Jackman go full berserker Wolverine and it is fabulous and absolutely brutal.Supporting Characters
Sir Patrick Stewart is back one last time as Charles Xavier and similar to Jackman he is brilliant here. The father figure and strong character is gone, replaced with a weak and damaged man that has gone through a lot. The dynamic between Charles and Logan is fascinating here, as it really feels like the roles have reversed and that Logan has to look after Charles which is great to see. Dafne Keen makes her film debut as X-23 and she is fantastic, she has hardly any dialogue but you can't help but care about her and I really bought into her relationship with Logan and where it grows. The dynamic between these characters is really the thing that carries the movie and you really care about these characters and it really drives this movie. Stephen Merchant, Boyd Holbrook and Richard E Grant also all do good jobs in their smaller roles here.Story
Now even though this film has characters from the X-Men universe, this couldn't be further away from an X-Men film. It really focuses on the characters and the damage that has occurred to them over their lives and why they need to go on living for this young girl. As I mentioned above, the relationships between the characters and the friendship is what gives this movie weight and plenty of heart. It is a tragic story but a really well told one that fits the characters perfectly.Script
The script is really great, this world is so gritty and there is drama galore. The more mature writing fits the film perfectly and really shows where the characters are, especially Xavier when you consider what he has been like in the previous films. There are also little drops of humour too which is nice to see and ensures Wolverine still has those moments even if they aren't always meant to be funny.Style
The style is brilliant, this world they created for the film fits so well, it is dark, dirty and gritty and it really feels like the end of days for the mutants. The R rating for this film was the right choice, the action is brutal and violent and it adds to this films story and the way it is presented. It is such an emotional ride that is paced really well and keeps you interested throughout.Overall
Overall, this is a brilliant film, whether you are an X-Men, Wolverine or just film fan then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. It is an emotional roller coaster and by focusing on it's character give a story and journey that you won't forget.Rating - 10/10.","

"Logan","Vartiainen","25 June 2017","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return to their roles as Wolverine and Professor X, respectively, in this film that is almost certainly Jackman's last run as Wolverine and might just be Stewart's last as Professor X as well. And as far as swan songs go, they could not have asked for a better film.It's 2029 and mutants have become an endangered species. No new mutants have been born in years and only a few of the old guard are left. One of the few ""lucky"" survivors is Logan, who is radically removed from his glory days, being reduced to a suffering husk of his former self. And he has gotten off lightly compared to Charles Xavier, trust me. But then a new mutant enters their lives. A young girl with a power set almost identical to that of Wolverine's.James Mangold is once again directing and he continues to show that he really gets the character. The Wolverine focused on Logan's past and the human behind the adamantium skeleton and the nigh immortality. Logan focuses on the mortality of the character. On the fact that all beings, even one such as Wolverine, must grow old. Must one day, no matter how far into the future, die.In that light I'm almost hesitant to call this movie a superhero film. Because it's such a reconstruction of the genre that it's almost a new thing in and on itself. It borrows heavily from westerns and the rougher side of Americana, while also being a bittersweet love letter to all the previous X-Men films and to all superhero films in general. While also being a brilliant film in its own right.Here's to you Hugh Jackman. Here's to you Patrick Stewart. And here's to you James Mangold. This will not be the last superhero film. But it almost should be.","

"Logan","MattJackman92","16 June 2020","Logan is a gritty tale of a once great man, now struggling with his existence, angry with his past and tired with the world. It's very different from any previous superhero film that I have seen (although thank you Deadpool for opening the door to 'R-rated' superhero movies). I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men series of films, but this feels like the 'true' version of Wolverine. He's not a superhero, he's just a man who begrudgingly tries to find redemption by helping a young girl find sanctuary.I love the tone of the movie, the cinematography is outstanding, the characters are beautifully written and outstandingly portrayed. The action scenes are phenomenal, although the movie is not dependent on them one bit like other superhero films. The film even managed to give Stephen Merchant a believable, bad-ass action line!8.9 - Everyone should watch this film, superhero and non-superhero fans alike!","

I really hope they don't recast this character going forward, at least anytime soon.","

"Logan","mounirrmaged","14 August 2017","Comic book movies have been through an impressive change over the course of the years. Superman 1978 peaked the audiences' interest in the genre, allowing superheroes to become big budget superhero franchises. And it kept growing bigger with other films like batman 1989. It wasn't until the mid 90s to the late 90s that this genre started to fall. With shitty ass movies like batman and robin and steel, people started to give up on the superhero movies. Fast forward to 2008, iron man and the dark knight not only gained the audience back, but they allowed the genre to grow in an unbelievable rate, giving birth to the MCU. There are still some crappy films both in the MCU, DCEU and some in FOX x-men. Enter logan, the film that dares to challenge the superhero genre. Logan is easily the best superhero movie of all time and for good reasons: This is a phenomenal comic book movie. The most mature one as well. Now a lot of people say that this is a dark and gritty film and to an extent, they are right. But this is a film that gives us a harsh, harsh reality that wolverine, has to deal with. He is living in the shadow of his old self. He doesn't have his healing factor, making him incredibly vulnerable both physically and mentally. His physical health is awful, and works as a driver for living. The film is pretty simple in its plot. It's not about a hero in a spandex fight crime, it's about a survivor in a hostile world. Logan is trying to have a normal life but he just can't. He is constantly chased by his past and his animalistic nature, as well as his lone wolf attitude. He doesn't even seem to be happy taking care of his professor. He also meets X-23, played by Dafne Keen, who gives a phenomenal performance despite not given much dialogue. Their relationship is tragic and heartfelt to behold. It is truly tragic that all this time, logan does not care about the child, but when he finally makes a connection, he dies in the most brutal way possible. Seeing x-23 crying over her father was a giant tear jerker thanks to the emotions from these actors that they professionally display. Now there are other elements in the film to comment on: 1. The action: This is action done right in a superhero movie. Not only is it the best choreographed, but it is also fills you with intensity and adrenaline. It is brutal and does not hold back. The most impressive thing is that they finally made the action were you worry for the survival of this hero, that you're afraid he won't get out of the situation alive, which you don't see in big budget superhero movies like in DCEU or MCU 2. Simpler is sometimes better: This is a movie with not much complexity in its plot or a giant spectacle. As mentioned earlier, this is a survival drama film, which is most fitting for a character like wolverine. You did not need giant spectacle to deliver badass action sequences. 3. Letting the director do his job: Most superhero movies have studio interference that ruin the project at the end result (suicide squad, age of ultron, batman v superman etc). But since FOX gave up on doing anything due to the previous wolverine movies, they let director James Mangold do his job, and oh boy was the end result fantastic. Yes, logan is truly a phenomenal superhero movie that is a marvel (pun not intended) to behold. Leaving clichés such as quips and witty dialogue in order to deliver a tragic character journey that leaves you satisfied and emotionally destroyed. It is a soulful film with a lot of heart. 10/10","

"Logan","Jackblyth8","9 February 2021","James Mangold directs the highly anticipated X-Men film 'Logan' centred around the nature and livelihood of the powerful X-24 (Wolverine).Hugh Jackman is back portraying Logan who comes out of retirement to help a young mutant girl return to a safe place during a chase with a callous corporation who stand as experimentalists with the girl and many like herself.The film itself is not what we were expecting, the tone is extremely formal and touches on the emotional side of life (particularly at the end). Patrick Stewart's character is used to slow down the story and add an alternative viewing to Jackman's character.The movie is generally fast-paced and exhibits a clear following throughout - the advancement is very much a journey, and a quest to peace and justice. It is great to see Jackman in his element and easily, 'Logan' is one of the best X-Men films of recent years.","

"Logan","SquigglyCrunch","5 April 2017","Logan follows the remaining X-Men in the distant future, where most mutants have long since gone extinct. A young girl comes to their door with a group of threatening people looking for her, thus beginning Logan's attempt to help her escape. As this is Hugh Jackman's last portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine, it had high stakes. Personally I didn't expect this level of quality from it, considering how most of these big blockbusters tend to go in the direction of lackluster. Logan is a heavy movie. It is fantastically performed by both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and the emotion they are able to infuse within the audience is more powerful than anything I've seen in the series thus far. The content itself is hard-hitting, thanks to a fantastic script, and as a whole this proves to be a huge step in an entirely different direction for the franchise. And that's a good thing.The R rating allows the movie to reach this level of heaviness, and with that weight comes some pretty awesome, but brutal, violence. Despite the warnings I received about how brutal the introduction alone was, I still managed to be surprised by it. The movie doesn't hold back, but it doesn't overdo it either. It's just right, and just right is exactly where I wanted it to be. The movie does a fantastic job of building atmosphere. It's dark, it's gritty, and it really feels like the end of the world. And in the context of the movie, I'm pretty sure that was the case. Overall Logan is a fantastic end to an already good series, and proves to be the best of that series, at least in my eyes. It's dark and gritty, but also well-acted, well-written, and never overdone. I can't wait to see this one again when it leaves theaters, and in the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie.","

Not just an outstanding Hugh Jackman brilliantly accompanied by Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen alongside others. Not just a director right at the top of his game. Not just an Oscar contender script. It´s a rare commercial movie that works, that stays true to its source and that is darkly mature and bluntly adult. A masterpiece and of the best superhero movies of all time. Period.","

"Logan","melwinbauer","30 December 2021","""Logan"" is the final part of the Wolverine trilogy. It depicts the end of the main X-men characters. Logan is the first film I have watched within the ""X-men universe"" or whatever you call it, and it was great. ""Logan"" follows a now old and bitter Wolverine, who is waiting to die with no purpose in his life. That changes when he encounters a child, a mutant.A great part about ""Logan"" is its relationships. The dynamic between Logan and Charles is a great father-son relationship and it's great to follow. Likewise, it's great to follow the dynamic between Logan and Laura and their father-daughter relationship. She brings something different out of Logan and makes him rethink his view on life and his decisions.The story in this film is great. The story is sometimes slow but still enjoyable and not boring. It isn't that complicated of a story, but it manages to keep the viewer on their toes through the whole movie while creating an interesting story where the tension continues to gradually rise and rise until it culminates at the very end. Visually the film is impressive. It is aesthetically very pleasing to look at and it makes great use of different colors and different environments.The great visuals continue when it comes to the action which is also great. The action is fast-paced, hard-hitting, and brutal. It is also easy to follow and the combat looks absolutely brutal which is great. The decision to make this film rated R is a great one. The action wouldn't have been as great without the brutality and gore made possible by the R-rating. It is also refreshing to hear unfiltered language in films, especially a movie like ""Logan"" which could've been turned into a marvel-like superhero film, which wouldn't have fit at all.Hugh Jackman as Logan is absolutely amazing. He brings a great performance and he contributes a lot to Logan being the badass that he is in this movie.To summarize, ""Logan"" is a great film about redemption and is absolutely worth a watch. I'm not sure if having not watched the prior films made my experience of watching ""Logan"" better or worse, but I can say that you should watch it even if you haven't watched the other films.","

"Logan","NothingSacred_com","22 March 2017","Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart alone are responsible for the few good moments in this sadistically bloody slasher epic, which details the death of the X-man Wolverine in some alternate future in 2029. At a recent screening at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, director James Mangold rambled on and on about his love of cowboy films and the classic SHANE in particular. Sir Patrick Stewart, who was also there, and who was treated rather shabbily by said director, revealed that the amusing dialogue between his character and Jackman's Logan was entirely ad-libbed. Thus we can credit Scott Frank and Mangold only with one tedious slashing/shooting death after another, all bereft of explanation, logic, or a coherent plot. Cyborg killers in Mad Max-style vehicles? No explanation. Mutant Caliban who can't go in the sun? No explanation or back story at all. Lack of all law enforcement? no explanation. The writers don't care. Other tallies include— Claw slashings: at least 200. Bullets: in the millions. F-bombs: about twenty-five. The Wolverine character deserves so much more than this. Whatever praise comes should be given to Jackman and Stewart alone, and to oddly violent little newcomer Dafne Keen; the rest of the film is a jumbled mess of disjointed scenes mimicking some of the good bits in SHANE. To make sure you get the connection, Mangold has his characters actually watch SHANE on a TV in some hotel. How boring.","

"Logan","fernandoschiavi","19 April 2020","There are those films that follow formulas and that are very successful and there are those that also become recognized and gain notoriety for not following formulas or for following other types of formulas not inherent to a certain genre. This second case is where 'Logan', by director James Mangold - fits, who had already directed the also excellent 'Wolverine Immortal "". FOX and the director decided to put a definitive end to the most acclaimed hero of comics and cinema, who followed for almost two decades and the final result is one of the great superhero stories ever written for the cinema. We are facing an innovative, courageous, incredibly creative film with performances and direction that enshrine this work and will make it remember for a long time In these more than 15 years on screen, adding both great adaptations and not so happy moments, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was in almost everyone.Based on a story by fellow director James Mangold, the screenplay written by Scott Frank, Michael Green and Mangold himself was inspired by a more recent Mark Millar and Steve McNiven comic, 'The Old Logan'. From this story of the road - in which the aging and debilitated mutant crosses the United States in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which eccentric villains dominated the country to help an old ally deliver an illegal package - however, Logan's script takes advantage only the state of Wolverine and the idea of a dystopian future. The trio manages to deliver a first-rate drama, with a character development arc, with twists and turns and emotional and action scenes hardly portrayed in films of the genre. Being a superhero film is just one detail in the complex and striking plot. In it, we can follow a whole journey of self-knowledge and redemption of our beloved hero.In 2029, Logan (Hugh Jackman) makes his living as a limo driver to look after nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). At his side in this endeavor, we have Caliban (Stephen Merchant), one of the few mutants left. Physically debilitated and emotionally drained, he is wanted by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a Mexican woman who needs the help of the ex-X-Men to defend little Laura Kinney / X-23 (Dafne Keen). At the same time that he refuses to return to active duty, Logan is chased by cyborg mercenary Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), interested in the girl.Developing this idea of a dystopian future well, the director deftly creates this darker, darker world and the tone of pessimism is what prevails throughout the entire projection. However, it is in the list of characters that the great asset of 'Logan' is found. Anxious by the fans, we can see the family relationship between the weakened, calloused and scarred pupil Logan and the master, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the most powerful mind in the world, who now suffers mentally with advancing age. And when the girl Laura (the excellent Dafne Keen, who dominates the non-verbal expression, showing a variety of emotions with just her eyes) comes on the scene, we have the idea of family again present in Logan's life. The interaction between the trio is what sustains Logan's actions throughout the film. In one of the scenes when they pass for a family, it is one of the best in the film, with several references to Professor Xavier's Mutants School and the relationship between them. Make-up on the edge of the unrecognizable, old and tired, Jackman and Stewart do the best job as these characters have since they started this journey. The film balances these moments exceptionally well with explosions of action and fury, setting the stage for a promising and liberating continuity from the shackles of the confused canon established in the X-Men universe in theaters.
At no time does he worry about being didactic, does not use cards or voice-overs to prepare us for this future, he passes on to us every information we need to know through his dialogues and does not waste time offering us the causes of all that . At no time did we discover Xavier's disease, Alzheimer's is only left in the air through Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who is also the apparent culprit for the disappearance of the mutants, a fact that we also do not understand how it happened and, fact, we don't need to know.The film already establishes the state of the mutant in the first few seconds of the projection, making it clear that his glory days are gone. Hugh Jackman arrives with a wistful air, red eyes and a wobbly walk. The excessive use of alcohol acts as a way of escape for Wolverine not having to deal with his biggest enemy: the guilt he carries for everything he did in other times. To work this out visually, director James Mangold bets on open plans to show the ruin of the scenarios and on closed plans to create an intimate connection with the people shown there.James Mangold makes 'Logan' a road movie with several turns. Forget if you expect a classic superhero movie, with cover heroes and scenes full of special effects. Realism sets the tone, not only in the setting, but also in the action scenes. Logan also knew how to take advantage of his higher rating to give fans the brutal violence they always wanted from Wolverine. However, management did not use this freedom to deliver rampant gore and profanity out of context - everything was used for the sake of history.It is not an action movie with dramatic sequences, but a drama movie with action sequences. The scenes of violence in the place where Wolverine and Caliban took care of Professor Xavier are visceral. It was also the first time that we saw sweet Laura showing a side that even shocked the viewer. Talent and pure competence of the young Dafne Keen, who manages to pass the innocence and sweetness of a child at the same time that she is able to cut cold and violently with anger and fury several of her persecutors. The graphic violence of blades piercing heads, necks, arms, viscera is present to exhaustion here and is repeated in the scenes of the Harrah hotel and casino in Oklahoma, on the Munson family farm, and the last act near the border for Eden. In all the scenes, brutality, strength and realism impress and shock the audience, on purpose. Filmed millimeter, each blow or injury is felt. In the X-Men movies we never saw Wolverine really release all of his anger and show off the killer animal he is. In 'Logan', the film is not afraid to show all the blood and violence it entails.It is certain, however, that Logan - even though he idolizes his origin in the comics all the time - could have been more ""heroic"". Were it not for the claws and powers, the film would go very well as an action drama disconnected from this legacy of the hero. By anchoring him in a supposed realism, looking for the adult Wolverine that fans had been waiting for years and without really exploring the potential of villains like Pierce and the Butchers, Mangold and Jackman disregard another aspect of the character that was desired ... the super -classic hero, who is once again left in the imagination - in conversations about the past and what was left behind.
A superhero movie, a road movie, a western, a family drama, a farewell letter, a new start, which teaches you ""not to be what they did to you"". Anyway, a movie. A great movie. No label. Full of symbolism, James Mangold's feature opposes past and present, youth and old age, nostalgia and novelty to make the baton pass to a new generation. 'Logan' is a visceral experience that leaves the bittersweet taste of questioning about life and death, about the past and the wrong choices left in it and also about the possibility of redemption.
Perhaps the film will not appeal to those who seek something similar to other superhero films, but it will certainly delight everyone who seeks a melancholy, harsh, tense drama in many moments, but above all human. This does not mean that 'Logan' is better than traditional superhero films, but it is simply different, in discarding everything we could expect from him. And the most impressive thing is that the film can do this without being pretentious. It is a film full of emotional and unique in which Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career, honoring almost two decades playing the character in a farewell worthy of reverences marking his name in the history of cinema.","

"Logan","colonel52","17 March 2017","James Mangold wrote and directed Logan things became depressing quickly and set the tone for the rest of the movie. This film should be titled kill kill and die. Or ""Sick Wolverine"" I find it hard to believe so many liked this movie, or worse thought it was great.I don't care for sick wolverine, it makes no sense the adamantium was poisoning him, and I think it was the genetic stuff in foods, that made the mutants unable to reproduce, and also for them to die of some ailment. Wolverines healing power fought it but was losing. But really this is not a good story and ruined the movie for me, I would rather see a normal wolverine one last time than to see this travesty. And if they are going to kill him then so be it, but I don't really like that either. When a actor is saying one more time, they tend to think O lets kill him off then. I don't like that,The girl Laura was the best thing in the movie, was his DNA daughter, and she looked like fameke Jansen who played jean so they could have said she had DNA from jean too. played superbly by the young Dafne Keen. She never speaks thru half the movie, so does it all with looks etc. And they could have ended it with Logan going to Canada with his new daughter, and the other kids, and starting a school like Xavier did in past. That would have been a better ending that this crap.Basically everyone in movie dies, except few of the kids, and cant remember if any of the bad guys survived, like the geneticist? Even the family that helped them all died, kill kill kill, not a happy movie at all, just the opposite, very dark and depressing movie with a few light moments that were quickly squashed by something bad.I did really like the character growth between Logan and the girl, which might be one of the main highlights of the movie's story for me.I would only watch this again to see the Laura scenes, but it is so depressing I don't know if I ever will want to watch this again.The main villains of the film are very one-dimensional; at times, the film almost goes deep into their motivations, but abruptly interrupts itself in lieu of more awesome fight scenes. Basically you have a bunch of guys with guns, but they don't use the guns or do so rarely. The main bad guy just seemed not bad, like a robot doing a job. The geneticist was a little better but seemed to come out of nowhere in middle of movie, and was kind of corny.I gave it a 2 of 10 and I have always liked wolverine and the actor playing the part. The writing and story was awful except for Logan's daughter, take that and write a better story, and it could have been a great movie.Aside from Laura, this story really sucked, the worst of all the wolverine movies.It was R rated so they could show graphic violence and I like that, but combined with the depressing story makes it harder to watch.So Logan winds up buried in some woods, and Prof X buried some unmarked grave too, and everyone says yeah it was great and fitting ending for these 2 characters lol.O and having Prof X be sick like he was sort of ruined having him in the movie too, and not good to remember him by. I guess I am just an oddball for not liking it, or people who don't like it probably don't want to take the time to come here and do a review, just the fanboys that loved it.","

"Logan","KingLeo300","26 April 2023","It's amazing how watching the same movie twice, can offer a different connection depending on the part of your life you watch it. In 2017 when I first watched this movie, my dad could get around on his own 2 feet fine. In 2023, he's no longer around, but the movie gives me a nice reminder of when I used to carry him up the stairs to bed.This is now only the second comic book movie I've given the highest rating to, with a 4.5, which puts it equal with The Dark Knight, and overtakes Infinity War as my favourite marvel movie.In 2017 I gave this movie a 4.0, but as the years went by, I always had it in the back of my mind, that the movie is better than i think it is. I felt I should like the movie more, but needed to re-watch it to be sure, and it didn't disappoint. This movie might get a perfect score from me one day.","

"Logan","elshikh4","8 October 2022","""Calm down, and be reasonable!"". This is what I used to say to this movie's die-hard fans back in 2017. Because it really didn't deserve that too much praise it had. Whether the viewers were thirsting for an rated R superhero movie anyway, or the publicity played its outrageous role of hyping!Director James Mangold said that the movie is influenced by many other works like: Mark Millar and Steve McNiven's (Old Man Logan) comics, George Stevens' (Shane - 1953), Clint Eastwood's (The Gauntlet - 1977), and many more. However, the final product isn't that original. It's like a road / western / thriller long chase of a movie, which sounds good in itself. But, it's - in fact - a too sad, too bloody, superhero movie, and that's the only renewal here!Speaking about unoriginality, the matter of a peaceful family, that hosts the lead, while not knowing anything about his identity, or the ones who chase him, then gets killed because of him, short time later--is wholly recycled from Logan's previous movie (X-Men Origins: Wolverine - 2009)!Aside from that, the script doesn't care of doing its job rightly. For burning examples: How did Professor X killed all of his school's students? Why there is no explanation for the death of all the X-men and women?! Logan gets poisoned due to Adamantium in his body! What?! Why didn't he have this disease state since - let's say - 50 years ago?! The bad guys are generic bad guys that you already have seen at least a thousand times before! Gabriela López, the nurse, filmed everything in that secret hospital, and nobody ever saw her?! How come that Laura the kid doesn't utter a word unless in the third act?!! Those X-kids don't show their superpowers to defend themselves unless very late! And can I ask a small question: where is Magneto?!In the third act, the title character was almost dead, getting weaker by anything that might hit him. This is not the end of a hero, rather a manipulation of a hero. And you know what? It made the movie so predictable!The profanity was totally unnecessary. Does that mean that the characters - suddenly - get to curse after becoming older?! Or is it a pure commercial trick where you're attracted to see the movie in which the famous polite characters get to curse? Well, a pure and dirty commercial trick then!You can say that again about the crazy violence, and the nude shot, as more degenerate tricks that poison this movie, cinema and you!Moreover, I didn't like the battles of Logan with X-24, his evil clone. They were too fast to watch, and had nothing exciting about them. And I didn't like the last shot, in which the grave's cross becomes an X sign. There is a kind of blasphemy in it. But what do you expect from a movie that takes God's name in vain!As for the virtues, depicting aging superheroes was interesting. The idea of Logan's clone was smart. Using Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' (Hurt), in the movie's trailer and the movie itself, was a masterstroke; it embodied the movie, and added a lot to it. And Mangold was very good, especially in most of the action sequences.So it's all about different atmosphere and taste from the rest of the X-Men cinematic series, made for the sake of Wolverine, who wasn't that lucky in his previous 2 stand-alone movies. Though, I believe that their second, (The Wolverine - 2013), was better than this one, because of its solidly in comparison.Superficially, (Logan - 2017) is about an evil authority that chases some talented people to terminate their humanity. However, the extreme violence assures the termination of humanity in the moviemakers themselves. So much so that the sad superhero movie turns into nihilistic slasher in the end. Hence, there is no message in this movie. It's just a chance to watch an X-Men movie with profanity, nudity and endless gallons of blood.. Nothing more. So the actual goal of it is being rated R. And what a pitiful goal that is.","

"Logan","imdb2-5","13 March 2017","Hugh Jackman was made for the role of Wolverine, even though he is a tremendous actor in his own right. However this swan song was one of the weakest X-Men film and it suffered from numerous obvious plot holes that made the audience go ""what?"" At the end of the movie, someone in the audience yelled out ""that ending sucked!!!"" and the entire audience laughed heartily - because most did feel that this was a mediocre tearjerker that wasted some great performances and superb CGI.I won't give away too much in this review, just enough for you to set expectations. It sucks when characters do stupid things which you know occur solely to continue the plot. For example, if you know someone is coming after you to kill you and it will be worse then next go round, you don't just let them hang around as if you're just a little careless - especially after a bloodbath. And it happens too often.What was truly terrible about the ending, without giving it away, was that it seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to figure out how to work in the ensemble shot reminiscent of a stage play that Hollywood cannot seem to stop itself from doing. It's phony and ludicrous. And I won't even describe the action, which basically happens throughout the movie. Characters will ""forget"" their abilities to do something smart or dangerous because if they do what you expect, it will ruin the scene from going where the directors want it to go.The other aspect I didn't like about this movie was that Logan's character doesn't really get developed at all. It is manipulated and you'll appreciate what I'm saying when you finally get there. Please... we're all pretty smart. Don't insult our intelligence with yet another breathtaking spectacular moment where you can feel the director just praising himself endlessly for creating an emotional moment that is right up there on par with, oh... the climax of Saving Private Ryan. After taking forever to get to the ending, they rush right through it, as if they blew too much of the budget drawing out the first 2 hours and 10 minutes. It's all watchable although completely unnecessary and milked for one last haul of cash. The young girl is very good but they seem to have kept the mystique for absolutely no reason whatsoever but to... well... make it super mysterious. It's OK but don't expect anything near the 8.4 on the IMDb ratings. This is another X-Men B-Movie, not really worth multiple viewings but something you might catch on cable. Farewell to two of the great actors who graced the screen with some great moments in cinematic history.","

"Logan","leomilan","23 July 2017","Logan is a movie loosely based on the comic book Old Man Logan where an old retired wolverine takes a cross country trip in search of money and redemption. The comic book was great but I can't say the same for Logan. Many people say they love this movie and the dark rated R format really captures the true essence of the wolverine character which I agree with but as a movie, I just hated it. The movie starts off strong with Wolverine dismantling a Mexican gang and the portrayal of an ill Professor X, but after that all that really happens is a boring back story of X-23, Wolverine yelling at X-23 and Charles, Logan and X-23 flailing their claws killing people, and more of Hugh Jackman yelling. By the time the movie was 2/3 through I couldn't take it anymore I was overwhelmed with boredom and bad acting (mostly from the actress who portrayed Laura/X-23). Overall I just felt let down by the writers. They could've done so much more with the script but they kept it to a long boring Wolverine movie with an unnecessary ambiguous destruction of the X-Men and Mutants with very little Easter eggs on what actually happened. This movie completes the Wolverine trilogy of bad writing and a waste of the Wolverine character and Hugh Jackman.","

"Logan","deloudelouvain","11 December 2018","I had to watch this movie three times over as for the first two attempts each time I fell asleep. Not out of boredom or so but just because I was just too tired. And I'm glad I took my time to watch it a third time as Logan is by far the best Wolverine movie made as thus far. Wolverine is one of the most appealing X-Men to watch as he's one of the more ""human"" ones and one we can relate most with. In Logan you get a more emotional story, with of course alot of action scenes. Those action scenes are worth the detour, especially the ones where Logan fights side by side with the young Dafne Keen. Good job from her as well as she has a major part in this movie, mostly silent but with the right facial expressions. From all the X-Men movies I saw before Logan must be the one I enjoyed the most.","

"Logan","Hellmant","9 March 2017","'LOGAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third and final standalone Wolverine movie (and the 10th installment in the 'X-MEN' cinematic film universe); once again based on the popular Marvel Comics character, with Hugh Jackman reprising his most iconic role (for supposedly the last time). The film has an aging Wolverine traveling across a dystopian future America, in order to help a special young mutant girl. The movie also costars Patrick Stewart (reprising one of his two most iconic roles, once again, as Professor Xavier), Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant and Stephen Merchant. It was directed by James Mangold (who also helmed 2013's 'THE WOLVERINE'), and it was written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, so far, and it's received nearly unanimous positive reviews, from critics and fans alike. I enjoyed it as well. The story is set in the year 2029, when mutants are almost entirely extinct. Logan (Jackman) is now aging like a human does, due to the fact that his adamantium skeleton is now poisoning his body (and it's stopped healing him as well). He's now working as a chauffeur driver, in Texas, and helping to take care of Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart); who's suffering from a disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by a nurse (Elizabeth Rodriguez), who wants him to help transport an 11- year- old girl (Keen), with very special powers, to a place in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly agrees.The movie is surprisingly dark, and extremely dramatic. It's definitely a very serious character study, and not a fun action flick like it's predecessors. The movie is also shockingly violent; and it's the second 'X-MEN' film to be rated R, in as many years (following last year's blockbuster 'DEADPOOL'). Hugh Jackman is also fantastic in the lead, giving arguably his best performance in the role. For all of these reasons, I really respect this movie. Like I said, it's not a fun comic book flick (like some might be expecting), but it is a really well made drama film. It's actually the type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but we'll have to wait and see about that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/203409666","

"Logan","msbreviews","6 August 2017","Well, if you're thinking this is just another typical X-Men or cliché superhero movie ... You're seriously wrong. Of all the comic- book movies I've seen, I dare to say this is the one that I can finally call a goddamn DRAMA. Plus, this time it's rated R! Thank you Deadpool, I honestly hope that we'll have more films like this in the future.The very first scene instantly transports us to a different tone that we're not used to seeing in this type of films. It's darker, gritty, bloody, gruesome, grisly, did I mention bloody? There are so many scenes that just stuck to my memory, I constantly jaw-dropped at almost every single action scene. AWESOME! Excellent direction by James Mangold, the quick cuts worried me at the beginning, but it's almost flawless. As for the action, this movie nails it and surpassed the already huge hype that it had. Best action from the whole  X-Men franchise.Hugh Jackman ... It's an epic goodbye. As always, he's magnificent which I already expected before entering the theater. I mean, it's a character that he's been playing for almost 20 years, it's a routine that he knows from scratch, but this one is really the best from him.  A very different Logan and he nailed it perfectly. Patrick Stewart is great as always and this time he's even funnier than Hugh Jackman! However, the real surprise is Dafne Keen (Laura), who plays the extraordinary kid. She's able to connect with the audience without saying a SINGLE WORD until the beginning of the third act. Honestly, she reminded me of Millie Bobby Brown's powerful performance of Eleven on Stranger Things. She's that good. Marvel just keeps getting the casting right, again and again, every single time.I can't and I won't tell you much about the story. What I can say is that this is definitely the most emotional and captivated that I've ever been in an X-Men movie. The ending is as perfect as it can be and the movie is honestly more than I expected it to be. It surpassed the hype surrounding it and I can only congratulate James Mangold for the brilliant work.Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect as a whole (none is) even if it has a lot of perfect action scenes and performances. The pacing drops to a slow-burn in the second act (the least great of the three ... still great, though) and, don't get me wrong, it is needed and it's well compensated later in the movie, but it still dragged on for a little too much. The villain worked for the plot, I don't have that many problems with him even if I did expect more from him. A few exposition scenes, in the beginning, explaining the origins and purpose of some important backstory nagged me a bit, I think they had the possibilities and means to achieve a better way to explain everything (as they did in some other situations throughout the film) without recurring to an iPhone video.All of these are minor issues because Logan is f*cking AWESOME! The bloodiest X-Men movie ever, the best X-Men action scenes ever and the best Hugh Jackman in all of the franchise: this is the best film from the X-Men universe. An emotional DRAMA, with powerful performances from both main and supporting actors, a beautiful ending and an epic journey that now (supposedly) ends. Thank you, Hugh Jackman. You will not be forgotten!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)","

Surprisingly because it really is my favorite of the entire MCU and I had reviewed some of the other CGI crap from the MCU. But this one was really well done. Deadpool would be my second favorite after this film for Ryan Reynolds' comedy. If you have to watch one Marvel film in your lifetime, this one is it. It's low on cheese, heavy on the meaty toppings and the little girl simply kicks ass without the SJW/female empowerment political banter other Disney films are famous for. This little girl really earns our respect as a feisty formidable baby wolverine. Of course, this film also has two of the best actors of the MCU, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. This film earns a place on the BluRay shelf of top comic book movies.","

"Logan","TheHoodOfSwords","25 May 2020","Charles Xavier: You know, Logan. This was, without a doubt, the most perfect night I've had in a very long time... and I don't deserve it, do I?I don't know if it's just me but I love movies with a conclusion. I'm all for huge sprawling storylines but I like the ending. You always want more but at some point it all has to end. Logan does this perfectly. We see Logan who is old now, his body deteriorating and his mutant powers failing on him slowly. He's an alcoholic and he just wants to die. He has nothing to fight for anymore except Charles. Who is now borderline senile and has seizures that are capable of paralyzingly and killing all those around him.Logan is beaten down and although he still has fight left in him he knows his end is coming. He soon meets X-23 or Laura. A mutant who has powers like him. The film follows them as Logan tries to bring Laura to Eden, a place that she can be safe. You start off and you don't really care for Laura but by the end the relationship between Logan and Laura is heartfelt touching and sweet.This movie is brutal. I truly mean it. I like how now studios aren't scared to make a movie a hard R. This movie is brutal and violent and it feels like the wolverine movie we've needed for a long time. Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as always. The conclusions to Logan's storyline feels fleshed out and real. Not like they just threw it all together. It feels real and like any amazing movie should make you feel.I saw this a year or so ago and coming back to it now was so much more powerful. I can't say a whole lot because I don't want to give spoilers but this movie is depressing. Really
Depressing. If you go into this expecting a fun Quicksilver time in a bottle type movie you're mistaken. This movie is brutal raw and real and keeps with the racism theme of the other X-Men films but puts it to the side a bit to focus on Logan and I'm honestly fine with that.The ""villain"" is basically in my opinion just in there to drive the plot forward. This is a character driven movie through and through about a man with nothing to live for just waiting to die who is suddenly thrust back into his old life and has to deal with the death and destruction that follows him.It takes a bit to pick up but once it does it's brilliant. This is the best X-Men film I've seen and a spectacular one all around. Please see this if you're ready to get your heart strings pulled on. Maybe have a cry and a bittersweet smile about the future.","

"Logan","paulclaassen","3 July 2018","Unfortunately I did not enjoy this at all, mostly because I did not like this vision of the X-Men. The film plays more like a drama than a fantasy superhero film and the (very little) effects are mediocre compared to the previous films. Wolverine is a passive, pathetic character that actually deserves to die. The film is also unbearably noisy at times with way too much yelling and screaming. I'll conveniently forget I've seen this. Wolverine was brilliant in the three X-Men films, and X-Men Origins, which explained how he became Wolverine. The Wolverine followed his adventures after 'X-Men: The Last Stand', and then already did I get a feeling there were nothing more to tell about this character. 'Logan' therefore was an unnecessary installment. We learn that he has a daughter - a cloned daughter! Seriously, I hope they don't clone Wolverine for another sequel...Dafne Keen was fantastic as his daughter and I predict a great future for her.","

"Logan","Wirxaw","18 April 2017","Warning - outright spoilers, as I will bring the silly and plot-crucial moments here.By all means, I will agree that the movie is shot very well. Language, blood, action scenes, acting - everything is very, very solid. A real breakthrough after most of Marvel comedy.So why 6\10? Because I couldn't watch this movie without twitching. Scratching my head in disbelief, wondering ""what the fancy are they doing?"" -Antagonists. They seem to enjoy going out on their own. They have supermutants, cyborg soldiers, but in every situation - you'll see some top hat just standing there for... reasons. When first you see the big guy meet Logan, it gets clear that it's going down. Logan should pack his bags, pronto. And that the guy is probably bada** enough to stand up to Wolverine, since he was completely alone, completely d*ckwad and knew pretty much everything he needed. What happens next time we meet him? He is knocked out by a metal object. That's it. He's not a mutant, he's not some end boss, he's just a douche. And what is Logan's decision? Asking his indispensable tracker to... drive him away and dump him. WOW. I just sat there with my jaw open. Is that a bloody killer Wolverine's reaction to an enemy, who he knows is ""already"" going to kill him? Is that a G-level of approach undertaken in a R-rated movie? What the...Of course, this... madness... Leads to the meat of this movie - tracker is used to hunt Logan, the bad guy is always there show his useless face. If he'd have killed him there, you probably wouldn't need to continue with the movie.Same goes for the main scientist, who is there to kind of leash a pet, and who just stands next to armed Logan, explaining how evil he is. Wow. I thought that trope got old a couple decades ago. At least now Logan acts quickly, so the trope is kind of redundant, but the question is... Why include this character to begin with? Doesn't add anything to the movie.And then the big bad wolf(erine). Was he adamantium-boned? Or was he just the same genetic offspring of Logan? His face was already pummeled by an almost point-blank shotgun blast, which didn't reveal the skull. Yet... when a an adamantium bullet is shot through Magnum - half his skull goes off. We've seen Logan survive this kind of shot before. He was mostly alright. And we don't know much about about big bad wolv. Yet suddenly this is a deus ex, a very pointless deus ex, on many levels. When all the kids combine their powers to kill a ""human"", one would wonder - why not just kill the big bad wolv? Or at least knock it out? Telekinesis, freezing - there are methods... Overall the final scene is very, very lackluster.-Protagonists. Xavier sure takes his sweet time to reveal anything remotely worthwhile, making enraged Logan a protracted trend throughout the movie. Making everything a painful guess. He is shown to be able to communicate and sense mutants, yet what about tracker? What about big bad wolv? What about other kids? When they stopped at every worst corner, prompting the casino scene, the family butcher scene, I just wondered... ""why"". I think Man of Steel would cringe at the level of carelessness here. They wanted to get lost in a casino? Gee, great, with that level of hunting on them, they'd be sure to wipe out everyone in casino if need be. Of course, Logan takes his sweet time in pub, because it's not like he has barely escaped out of his own house... And, of course, the family dinner. I understand why was the plot line involved, but... why make it so incredibly dumb? If Xavier was too old to think straight, maybe Logan could've said something precise. They wasted a whole family on a stupid whim. And, of course, big bad wolv had to just stand there and listen to Xavier, to give surprise at what comes next. Except for when you think about it, he would have no reason to, besides allowing a kind of sad exposition.-The Finale. I've mostly described everything, except for Logan's...well. Kids already were shown to have this weird green medicine. There were trucks around, probably carrying this stuff. Damn it, even Hishe ridiculed two of the moments I described, for good reason. Couldn't they show kids looking for the medicine? Giving at least some ""fancy"" about it? No... it was almost as stupid as Han Solo's ... well, in Episode VII.So, to conclude, the movie is shot very well, very gritty and realistic. But I think the writing took some lessons from Prometheus or Gravity... for whatever reason. And it ruined some impression, as well as left an aftertaste. People compare this movie to TDK, and, frankly, not even close. No. Just... no. In the same league, perhaps, but this is a 2 hour ""wut"", not a grand movie.","

As always, I enjoy seeing both Jackman and Stewart as they are both amazing actors. The movie though? Worst of all the X-Men movies (even worse than the 3rd one from the original trilogy which is saying something). The violence was so over-the-top it was actually distracting. Some aspects were left completely unexplained (like the writers simply expected the viewers to 'know' - i.e. what was wrong with Xavier's mind, who the Reavers are and 'why' they have 1 metal hand, why there are no mutants left). The kid was fine when she wasn't speaking but then she wouldn't shut up so she became very irritating. Her 'attachment' to Logan really made no sense at all since she had just met him (and now she's crying over his body saying 'daddy'? Really?). Maybe I just didn't like it because they kill off everyone I liked. The best part of the movie was the 3 minute 'teaser' at the beginning for Deadpool.","

"Logan","frisco2007","4 March 2017","Of all the X-Men, X-Men Origin and X-Men prequel movies, this movie is the worst, and separate from that - it is a bad movie, standing alone. Unlike the effective - in (X-Men director) Brian Singer's paraphrased words ""I would want my favorite comic book universe, if made into a movie, to be taken seriously"" - other X-Men movies, this movie is filled with gratuitous violence, bizarre levels of cursing and a one-dimensional villain. I can't even remember the villain's name, that is how forgettable he was. Unlike Magneto or Colonel Striker, who were instantly memorable. We are told the movie takes place in the year 2029, but that makes no sense, since they keep repeating there have been no new mutants born in 25 years. Since 2004. But Prof. X's school was - I quote - taking place in the ""not too distant future"" - and was filled with kids in all the prior movies!!! Which were clearly taking place during, before and after 25 years ago, by any clear judgment. It made no sense. We were informed that Prof. X and Logan were among the last alive, that all the other X-Men from the newly resurrected Jean Grey to Scott. But with no explanation, they are all now dead. The entire pantheon of the X-Men, dead, when in the last movie with them - Days Of Future Past - they were all at the top of their game. We never found out what happened to Rogue - who was alive - or Bobby or even flipping Beast! And for some bizarre, entirely inexplicable reason, in this movie the mighty Wolverine is trying to get by ... as a chauffeur. With a chauffeur's permit and everything. IMPLAUSIBLE, MUCH? This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!! The movie has a double tragic death ending unbefitting the glory of these excellent characters. What a shame!!!","

"Logan","jace_the_film_guy","18 September 2022","After two disappointing solo films for Wolverine, the trilogy is beautifully concluded with Logan. Raw, violent and emotional, the film can be described just by looking at Wolverine's knuckles. This iteration of the character is elegantly written and edgy.Though some elements were overly convenient from a story perspective, the final product is still stunning. With reasonable stakes and a more realistic premise than other X-Men films, Logan is a remarkable swan song to the cinematic legend.Additional Note: The ""Get behind me"" scene is an all-timer.Another Additional Note: His heart in his hand!","

"Logan","cosmo_tiger","22 May 2017","""The world is not the same as it was."" In the future mutants are scarce and Logan (Jackman) is trying to hide from the world while caring for an ailing Professor X (Stewart). When someone finds him and asks for help he does his best to ignore them, but then he sees something that changes everything. Now Logan, Charles, and a girl are trying to find their way to Eden and finally find a peaceful life. This is one of the best comic book movies I have seen. The fact that this is R rated really helped the movie. The brutality and in-tenseness of the violence really helps you get fully invested in the film. My big hit against the Marvel/Avenger movies is that there is never any real drama and they are all cookie cutter and repetitive. The new X-Men series has continued the standard started by the Nolan Batman saga in that it is possible to make a comic book movie when the characters have real depth and emotion and a gripping adult story line. This movie contains all of that and more. You almost forget this is a superhero movie, and that is a good thing. The movie is brutal and very bloody, but again it really adds to the feel and the movie needs to show that Logan has changed. The previous stand alone Wolverine movies have not been good at all, but this one more than makes up for them. This is a movie I highly recommend whether you are a comic book movie fan or not. Overall, not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience. I give this an A-.","

"Logan","anselmdaniel","22 August 2020","This review contains spoilers.Logan is the final Wolverine movie starring Hugh Jackman as the titular character. The movie is set in a futuristic world where mutants are hunted and becoming extinct. A young girl with the same powers of Wolverine is discovered and Logan finds himself helping his fellow mutants.From the beginning of the movie, Logan is already a departure from previous X-Men movies. The movie earns its R-rating by showing lots of gratuitous gore as people are cut into pieces by Wolverine. The scene also shows how drastically different the tone is. Wolverine is not a hero and works a menial job as a limousine driver. Professor X is revealed to have suffered a mental disorder that cuased the deaths of many mutants. Logan is not a hero in these scenes. His goal of earning money to move the professor away is neither heoric or villainous. The plot then moves to its main arc of Laura and follows Logan and Professor X on a road trip as they escape mercenaries searching for Laura. This plot is basic, but the execution is unique. The story is incredibly grungy and filled with twists that the audience may not expect. This is a gory and brutal story of characters being hunted. This movie transcends the typical superhero movies that are so common nowadays with a massive tonal change. This movie is nothing like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's movies with their light and humorous tone. It is for this reason that the movie deserves praise for trying something different for superheroes.I am hard pressed to find anything wrong about the movie. The directing, editing, and acting are all good in this movie. Patrick Steward does a good job as a mentally damaged Charles Xavier. This movie does not appear to fit into any of the confusing X-Men story-lines, but this is acceptable with how the movie is stand-alone. Previous X-Men movies are not required viewing to watch this movie.Logan is highly recommended. The movie is a shining example of what a comic book movie can aspire to be.Grade: A","

"Logan","Animany94","2 October 2019","Logan is the best movie in the X-Men franchise, but is solely about Logan wanting to live without being confronted with the mutant agenda and works a steady job while he is hiding with Charles Xavier and Caliban both of whom in a sad condition. Not that it is bad, not at all, but I will stress that I mostly consider it a spin-off, and therefore my favorite ""X-Men"" movie is still Day of Future Past.But in this movie Logan is approached by a nurse who recognices him as the Wolverine and wants his help, but he doesn't want to. But that woman ends up turning his life upside-down because she knows something unsettling involving an 11-year-old girl and a gang of other mutant kids.This story adaption is just all out violent, sad, gory and packs up all the heartbreaking events we got in the comic, so if you don't mind all the severed limbs and children being harmed, then you're in for a hellride of emotions. It does give itself room for some quiter moments to let us get into the wants and hardships of the characters, so it works as a satisfying journey with enough growth and bonding to make you care for them.","

"Logan","FelipeCarrillo","6 June 2017","Weapon X, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens, has departed, but he has made it in style, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie, ""Logan"" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor, dusting off the glorious, intelligent, capable and above all human superhero movies.Jackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: ""It's not a superhero movie, it's a film about humans with powers"". Hugh offers a properly successor, she is Dafne Keen, newcomer actress who plays Laura, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. The dialogs for young actress are quasi-non-existent till the third act of the film, supplementing that phonetic absence by formidable physical skills within magnetic and violent action scenes; she's the precise.Wolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters, rough and badass guys. Here, the action sequences are justified, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry, pessimistic, melancholic and without a doubt, selected components can be compared with ""Midnight Special"" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace, aggressive when it has to be, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal, however, paradoxically, calm and sad melodies excel, they capture the atmosphere of the film.And emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations, incomprehensible twists, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. As it's becoming a road/buddy movie, interpersonal relationships are improving and wins a brilliantly tremendous connection. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must ""Logan"" thank ""Deadpool""? It's all in how you look at it, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents, everything tends to the wit, while nuance is different here, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film, however, they can breathe easier now, money continues coming in.Unfortunately, ""Logan"" must not be perfect thanks to the long- standing quandary which Marvel hasn't been able to keep down: antagonists. Year after year, movie after movie, despicable villains have to be as fundamental as setting or leading roles, they are a key piece in the puzzle, nonetheless, ""Logan"" re-inserted its reluctant hands in the painful ulcer. Perhaps, the screenwriters and director wanted the star trio was the absolute center of attention, embedding in the bad-guy role to Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who doesn't appear the time requested on the screen, a few Mexican police officers and one or two human demons. Another point which many people have reviled is its ""extensive"" length, when a film with fascinating components is long? ""Logan"" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone, script and performances, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman, who says ""never again"" to Wolvie's suit, however, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way. X","

"Logan","Jackbv123","23 July 2017","45 minutes of this movie elapsed before there was any significant attempt at a plot other than the fact that Logan and Xavier were very down and out. During that 45 minutes there was extensive gore and violence including several cases of men stabbed in the head by Logan's claws. There was one scene where the child, Laura, rolls a decapitated head which presumably was a result of her own fighting. I think Logan said either the F word or S word more frequently than any coherent sentence. Since there was no chance this movie would not be R rated, there was also a short flash of women's breasts just so the movie could be labeled as having nudity. (There are cases where producers actually find this advantageous.) Logan repeatedly uses either drugs or alcohol.The movie improves from there. We get some plot to explain where the movie should go next and why. The goal is to try to get Laura to Eden.All the violence and vulgar language continues through the rest of the movie, including at least one blood-spurting decapitation. It also includes the unnecessary killing of a mother and her teen son and then later torture of ""mutant"" children. Even the ""mutant"" children commit extreme acts of gore. I cannot overemphasize how much gore and violence there was.We do learn more about Laura's origins and there are several other significant events that occur that are extremely relevant in the ongoing X-Men story.In the ratings, I see a very high percentages of 10 votes, 9 votes and 8 votes. I have to assume that the people gave those votes did so because of the significance of events that take place in the story and their enjoyment level. This is no where near an all-time classic movie. I don't even rate it among the best of the X-Men saga.The villains were all cliché and overplayed. Hugh Jackman did nothing in the way of credible acting. I don't know if Patrick Stewart was acting like he was feeble or if he is just actually getting old, but even so, not his best performance. For much of the movie Dafne Keen did not speak and tried to look fierce and vicious a lot, which is a little hard for the size of girl she is. Later, she showed some promise, especially with events at the end. Basically, IF there was any acting in this moving, it was done by the children.I still give this a generous rating of 6. This is because after the first 45 minutes the plot became much more interesting.","

"Logan","dstan-71445","16 July 2022","Logan is by far one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. It's a drama focused , character driven and also action packed flick that captivated me since it's start. An authentic , gritty , bleak and hopeless drama takes place here , telling the story of 3 deeply developed main characters who won me over.Logan a tired , sickly , mean and hopeless man works as a limo driver to take care of the aging Charles Xavier who unlike him , besides his old age , is still hopeful , vibrant , sociable and full of life. These differing attitude and out look of theirs always puts them at odds and makes them argue a lot in a very emotional and sometimes humorous manner. I, for one really enjoyed seeing those two bicker.But besides their differences , they look out for each other. Logan respects him a lot and feels like he owes him for taking him in back when he was young and lost. He feels like doing the same and repaying him by protecting him from the Government and everybody out there who wants to capture him ( since he's a wanted man with a very powerful mind capable of being used as a weapon ) and tending to his needs. They planned on saving some cash , buying a boat and leaving for good to live peacefully somewhere out there. Then all of a sudden this little girl , Laura shows up and messes up this plan of theirs and becomes another burden for Logan to carry.Charles as vigourus as he is makes Logan take her in besides his refusal. But taking care of her proves to be a tougher job since an army is after her. The plot goes on like this.The writing was solid. I enjoyed every single dialogue between the characters as none of it was silly and padded out. None of the lines were wasted as each interchange served to develop the story and the characters. The acting by all was also superb. Hugh Jackman gave an amazing performance perfectly depicting Logan's angry , impatient and hopeless mien. Dafne Keen as the little mutant was sweet but also extremely fierce when she wants to be. And for the first time I didn't hate Boyd Holbrook at all. His smuggy and egotistic performance fitted his character well and made him a damn good villain. Sir Patrick Wilson as always was kind , polite and charming. The story was engaging and the gore throughout made the action scenes convincing. A genre defining movie that truly impressed me. A breath of fresh air after all the puerile junky comic movies Hollywood releases these days.","

"Logan","Fluke_Skywalker","1 June 2017","Plot; In the future, the man once known as Wolverine is tasked with getting a young mutant girl with powers like his own to safety.Abandoning the ""Go big or go home"" style mass destruction of the modern comic book movie, Logan instead strips away many of the genre's accouterments and keeps its scale on the small side. In both tone and aesthetic, it typically plays much more like a Western than ""Superhero movie"".Much has been made of its R-rating--a rarity in a genre that aims for mass appeal and merchandising--and for good reason. It's not just a few f-bombs and a little gore tossed in as window dressing. Though it's a little excessive at times, like a kid who's just turned 21 and overindulges because the shackles are now off, it's mostly used to good effect.  Hugh Jackman is Logan/Wolverine, and God help whoever eventually takes over the role (either in a reboot or a retcon or whatever is going on in the increasingly convoluted X-Men saga), and he's never been better than he is here. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see his named bandied about come awards season. That also goes for Patrick Stewart, who is every bit Jackman's equal as the painfully frail Dr. Xavier.Logan goes on for a bit too long, and I wasn't completely satisfied with some of the choices made in its third act, but it's a well made, flawlessly acted and refreshingly personal film that proves there's more to this genre than costumes and leveling cities.","

"Logan","cjbaker-45009","9 July 2020","Yes I know that I am late to the party however needs must as the Devil drives!As a total sceptic from day one....(Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? Too tall for a start) and an absdolute lover/avid fan of the comics and DJ Kat show Saturday morning Cartoon series on a certain Sky caneel (zero plus one will give you the answer) lol. I was more than dubious about the casting. Yet I do like to reserve opinion before seeing the goods (unlike the Daniel Craig as Bond critics and the Heath Ledger as The Joker ?...surely not? critics). Hugh Jackman owned the character of Logan The Wolverine from the very fist scene he depicted.Now, not a huge fan of all of the movies that followed but not all of them were terrible b ut the 2 consistentl pillars of strength were Wolverine; Professor X and their relationship (Somewhat reminiscent of Kirk and Spock or Riggs and Murtaugh). Anyway; Hugh Jackman conquered that role to the point of if there are any designs for Wolverine to appear in any upcoming movies or franchise there are some (ironically) seriously huge shoes to fill as Hugh Jackman dominated every incarnation of Logan.The first time I saw the Logan (opening week obviously) I was following the story and liking where it was going ""Spoiler"" (The hotel scene where Xavier is watching and explaining ""Shane"") I ultimately gauged what was happening. Not totally onboard with it and emotionally sulking like a child I continued to view and come the ned I was more than tearful and quite literally sobbing yet also exponentially impressed with what I had just saw!To give perspective I am a huge Trekkie and since I was old enough have been to the Theatre for every Star Trek Movie possible begining with Star Trek: Generations Again......""Spolier"" Not at all impressed with the fact that they kileed off Captain James T. Kirk! Furious does not even begin to cover it! However, being the Trekkie that I am after a while (quite possibly 2 to 3 years) I watched Generations again and saw the Kirk story in a completley different light! That was the only possible way that this could happen! ""Spoiler"" and paraphrasing ""Did we do it? did we make a difference?"" ""it was fun....oh my!""This is also absolutely the case with Logan. I saw it with some friends on opening week on a Thursday; some other friends couldn't make it so I said ""right we're going next Thursday!"" I went for the second time in 7 days and now already knowing the plot I was able to pay in full the emotional dividends this movie requires! ""Spoiler"" I was sobing like a child for the last 45 minutes of this screening, really crying with my shoulders shuddering and everything!The soundtrack is outstandig and still brings me to tears and just when I thyought this movie could not get any better I was encouraged to watch the NOIR version! Just WOW! - Thanki you for your time and if you're anything like me and have a deep appreciation for Cinema this is an absolute must (just please take the time to understand the history of the character and relationship with Xavier first as this hold even deeper meaning when viewing).","

Had we read some of negative reviews we might have been prepared.. However, I had seen a few claiming this was great.. should have known better.From the start you are hit in the face that every Xman movie that has gone before. including some set in the future are all wiped clean and count for nothing.All mutants are gone and only wolverine and charges (and presumly a few others) are left. All was for nothing.. quick silver might as well have let them all burn in the explosion at the school.In this crap vision of the future we run into the plot from Dark Angel (you can add Stranger Things into the mix).. without Jessica Alba. The mutant kids have again broken out of Manticore and one of them was built from Logans DNS.Max.. I mean Laura is total bad ass and can taken on dozens of armed men.. except at the end when her and your entire band of escaped mutants can't take on anyone. The whole films is dreary and depressive. Jackman and Stewart ham it up as best they can.. but by the end we are left wondering why bother. They could so easily have thrown in a happy ending which would have justified the previous 2 hours.. but no.. the kids run over the border to Canada to an uncertain future with no one to guide them.","

"Logan","repojack","16 January 2021","I've re-watched Logan endless times and I was pondering whether it is the greatest Comic Book Movie (CBM) of all time. I ultimately do not think that is a fair assessment as the best CBM's really are very different (Dark Night, Avengers Infinity War/Endgame, Iron Man, Superman 1978,, etc.)This is probably the most personal and gritty of them all though, and a fitting send-off for both Logan and Fox's X-Men franchise (which technically was the utterly forgettable X-Men Dark Phoneix).In that very first fight scene, as blood splattered and limbs flew, I think there was a collective sigh of pent-up release from all the 100's of previous PG-13 Wolverine fight scenes where that SHOULD have happened.Deadpool deserves credit for allowing Logan to exist by breaking through the R-rated CBM barrier (and boy does he take credit for that in Deadpool 2!).(Spoiler below)R.I.P.

"Logan","magatsu","8 March 2017","The movie started off well, with Prof X jailed and drugged in a DIY hideout maintained by Wolvie and Caliban. Pierce is a great villain, but there's no payoff with his abilities or menace. He's simply the foreman for the evil corporation that is growing test tube mutants and hunting them down. Besides having one robotic hand, him or his Reavers don't really have any glaring cybernetic advantages. It would have been interesting to see different types of cyborg Reavers as in the comics, but in this movie, they are simply claw fodder.Once the introduction of Wolvie's clone begins, the movie goes downhill. We know nothing as to how or why this clone suddenly appears. Why wouldn't there be clones of all the X-Men at this point? Wasn't it already proved in the most awful of its series, Terminator Genisys, that Arnold vs Younger Arnold is not that captivating? Why would it work in this movie? Why not make Pierce a more capable and challenging villain?Once the Prof is whacked, as well as the kind family that sheltered them, I really began to lose interest. What's the point of heroes if they can't protect the good and innocent? The ending made no sense. At the beginning, Lara takes on 20+ Reavers on her own. After being reunited with 10+ other powerful, trained killer mutant kids, they are running away and being captured by the same number of Reavers? It makes NO SENSE. I'm CONVINCED that the movie critic industry is PAID or compensated in some way by the studios to produce positive reviews to DUPE, bait and switch audiences all for $$$ because this movie is currently 77 on Metacritic when it should be a 37. Good violence, poor writing, sloppy ending is what you really get.Its truly sad that a Wolverine movie has yet to be made well. Will never watch another movie by Mangold ever again. Learned my lesson. Save your $ and wait til this streams. Trust me, you'll thank me later. This is also part of the reason why IMDb shut down their message boards. Not to silence the haters, but to silence the voices of critical yet honest reviewers that ultimately hurts the $ of the movie industry.","

"Logan","Screen_Blitz","4 March 2017","Since the inaugaration of the X-men franchise back in 2000, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always stood as a compelling force to be reckoned with in the superhero. He is not firmly your average superhero, he is a hero with true grit and compulsion. Over the years, Wolverine has evolved into a powerful character aching with tragedy and sorrow similar to Batman from the DC universe. Although the iron-claw-wielding mutant has had more than his fair share of time to shine as a visceral cinematic figure, the X-Men franchise has never exercised his true, but gritty spirit to the fullest extent like Christopher Nolan did with Batman in the 'Dark Knight' trilogy...until now. Diving deep into the heart of the titular hero, this film journeys far into the grittier territory of the X-Men universe with a story tackling on complex themes of morality and sorrow that's plagued the inner being of the lead hero. And returning to the director's chair is James Mangold who last directed 2013's 'Wolverine'. Set in 2029, almost the entire mutant race has been wiped and one of the last remaining of the kind is Logan (played by Hugh Jackman). Retired from his glory days, Logan is now living in isolation caring for a dying 90-year old Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart). When he's unexpectedly introduced to a young Latina girl named Laura (played by Dafne Keen) who happens to carry the same claw-wielding powers as him, he and Xavier must escort to safety. Pursuing after them are sadistic forces lead by half-human, half-robot Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) who is set out to kill the young girl.Here marks a major turning point for the X-Men franchise, and arguably one for the superhero genre. As this entry follows a much darker and somber story than the previous installments, it also strays away from the more family-friendly conventions of the both the franchise and the genre itself. Following the success of the R-rated 'Deadpool' which pushed the boundaries with over-the-top violence and sexually crude material, this one adopts an R-rating as opposed to the previous installments which housed a more friendly PG-13 rating. So this time around, when Wolverine hacks his enemies with those sharp metal claws of his, the results are much more gruesome and realistic than what we were accustomed to (let's not forget the four-letter words). While the bloody imagery may come as an objection to some viewers with a weak stomach (along with a small detriment to the box office), it allows the film to exercise to true and more devastating nature of the aching hero. The story introduces Logan as an aged hero is know devastated by the tragedy that put an end to his glory days, and a man strangled by an enemy he can't seem to defeat, his tragic past. The plot then carries out the relationship between him and a young girl with powers he knows little about, evolving into more of an atmospheric character study than a plot-driven story. Director James Mangold effectively builds on the nature of the fatigued character with rigid melancholy many superhero flicks have lacked over the past several years. To add to the spice, Mangold executes the story in the style that echoes the old western outlaw movies with a post-apocalyptic environment and criminal themes playing major roles in many scenes. Although the story meanders a little in the midsection, Mangold is very solid at keeping things moving.Hugh Jackman has always stood as the show-stealer in the X-Men franchise with his portrayal as Wolverine/Logan. Unlike the previous entries, this film packs a punch with strong emotional grit and atmosphere that allows Jackman to exercise a more poignant performance than what he's demonstrated in the past. Jackman nicely knocks the ball out of the park with a somber performance as the titular character, a performance that also marks his final portrayal in the role before retiring as the iconic hero. Along his side, the only supporting to make his return from the previous entries is Charles Xavier whose role is proudly reprised by Patrick Stewart. With the aged Xavier know handicapped without his ability to walk, Stewart gives a blissful, if occasionally humorous portrayal as this signature role. Coming along for the ride is a young newcomer Dafne Keen who steps into the role of the mysterious young Laura born with a same clawing-wielding gift as Wolverine. Cashing in only little dialogue beyond a series of screams and occasional Spanish-spoken lines, her performance is displayed largely during the action sequences as we watch her slice and dice through the enemies in a violent, but dazzling fashion. While her performance stands strong, it is the subtly in which the character that makes her stand out.Logan is astonishing superhero entry that packs a powerful punch with its gripping narrative and direction that defies the usual superhero conventions. It is an emotionally riveting that not only transcends the genre but serves as a spectacular sendoff to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with results that are vastly satisfying.","

All those other PG 13 movies frown upon anything like that (looking at you Suicide Squad!) Some people won't like this movie because it has a little more drama intertwined with the action. But it's finally a great story for Logan. I enjoy this movie a lot.","

"Logan","The-Sarkologist","13 March 2017","I wasn't sure what to make of this film, particularly since of late when a film hits the screens, while I may really enjoy it, once I have finished watching it it becomes a case of 'well, that was that, lets get on to the next one'. It is sort of like the concept of the chase where the anticipation of the movie is actually much better than the movie itself, especially when the teaser trailers give you enough to make you really want to see it, but not too much to the point where you basically have worked out the plot and only end up seeing the film because you have seen all the others in the franchise (as is the case with the latest Fast and Furious movie).However, it turned out that this film wasn't going to be following along the same lines as the previous X-men, or even Wolverine films. Okay, after the third film it looked as if the franchise was dead, but it was given a huge shot in the arm with the first origins movie, and also cemented Hugh Jackman as the character of Wolverine. In fact it will be difficult to even envisage anybody else being able to take up the mantle in the way that James McAvoy and Michael Fassenbender has done with Professor X and Magneto. However, after seventeen years, it looks as if it is time for Wolverine to hang up his claws, and what better way than a movie focused around both him and Professor X.The year is 2029 and pretty much all of the mutants have died, all except for Wolverine, the professor, and Caliban. The problem is that the operation that Wolverine had all those years ago where adamantium was fused to his skeleton is starting to have a side effect, namely it is hindering his ability to regenerate, and as such he is also growing old. Professor X on the other hand seems to be drifting in and out of dementia while having spasms that result in psychokinetic outbursts. In an attempt to control these outbursts Wolverine finds himself driving a limo and hustling for drugs outside a hospital. However, into his twilight years comes one final mission, a girl who needs to be smuggled out of the country.It is quite interesting teaming Wolverine and Professor X in a final movie as the characters cannot be any different from each other. Wolverine has always been portrayed as the loner who tries not to become too attached to people because whenever people are around him they end up dying. This was the image painted in the first origin movie. However Professor X has always been the communal one, being the founder of the X-men and the guy who went out of his way to track down mutants to bring them into a special school. This contrast is seen especially in the scene in the middle of the movie where they end up rescuing the horses from a farming family that have an unfortunate accident.In some ways people might suggest that this is a movie where the baton is being passed on to a younger generation, but this is not necessarily the case. Sure, it has painted a vastly different future than the one envisaged at the end of Days of Future Past, but it seems that no matter what they do there is always going to be a reaction against the mutants. In fact what happened to result in there being 'no mutants being born in the past twenty-five years' is left hanging in the air. Mind you, this is not necessarily going to be the last movie in the franchise, especially since a new Deadpool movie is now being advertised, though it is certainly a great way to retire a character that has made an appearance in every X-men movie (with the exception of the first Deadpool movie) that has been made to date.","

"Logan","iseeeliteinthesky","18 December 2017","It started really really great and til the middle, it was actually decent, then it turned really bad and just went downhill. The movie is really dark in a futuristic cold world and i like the music, its a little bit like The Road (2009), but its also to much gore in the movie. Heads are flying left and right, its not really especially nice or uplifting to view that kind of gore.The film was blatantly anti-white, where exacly all the perpetrators were white males, and all the good guys were of mixed color excluding Logan and Xavier. The badguy-army-wanting to kill the girl, and later also the hillbilly rasists on the farm. Well that felt really strange to watch kind of contradictory to the real world as i know it, but enough about politics.The first half of the movie felt deep and conscious. However there were many contradictories throughout the movie. The fact that Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) is alive is kind of strange since he died in Xmen 3. But he does an amazing job in this movie as always. Sir Patrick is getting old and its saddening. And Hugh Jackman is also excellent.","

"Logan","RLTerry1","3 March 2017","Uncanny! 20th Century Fox, Marvel, and TSG Entertainment's Logan is a compelling, grizzly, organic superhero movie that is the last to feature Hugh Jackman as Logan (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Prepare to have your mind blown as the action unfolds in such a way that your heart will be pounding, racing, and pumping adrenaline through your body and then tug at your heartstrings as emotions run high. Logan is quite possibly the most comprehensive and diegetically dynamic superhero movie ever, and perhaps best X-Men film in the long, successful franchise. With a penchant for thrilling, action, and even horror films, director James Mangold pulls out all the stops in the last chapter in the story of The Wolverine. While there have been several films about Logan/Wolvervine outside of the main X-Men films, this cinematic adventure will have you on the edge of your seat with anxiety and holding back tears simultaneously. Some of the responsibilities of the final chapter of a character or an actor portraying a long-standing character are striking a delicate balance between nostalgia, closure, but still providing audiences with a new story; overwhelmingly, this film delivers the absolute best as we bid farewell to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart from the X-Men universe and exceeds any and all expectations.What do James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma and Logan have in common? They are both grisly western films. Evidence of this is not only seen in the character development, pacing, and overall tone of the film, but can also be seen within the film itself as Professor X and Laura (Dafne Keen), the young girl traveling with Logan and Xavier, watch a western film on TV–a film that Xavier references several times as he reminisces about films from his childhood. While many think that the American Western film died out with Hollywood Golden age, it has certainly not retreated from cinemas. In fact, many of Quinten Tarrantino's films are westerns, the original Star Wars: A New Hope was a post-modern western, and Mangold's Logan is yet another example of a reimagination of the American Western film. Reading the film as a western enhances the visceral experience of the film. Although directors seldom pit cowboys against indians anymore, there are subtle references to that relational dynamic from early western movies within this film. Much like the Lone Ranger and many of John Wayne's characters, Logan is also a solemn solitary character being pulled into a world built upon the idea of relationships but his baggage makes it incredibly difficult. Emotions run high in Logan; and it's these emotions that provide audiences with a comprehensive experience that fulfills the desire for gritty action plus moments that may stir you to tears.Although we are just coming out of this year's award season, it's entirely possible that Logan may be the first superhero motion picture to be nominated and even win Best Picture at next year's Oscars. All the elements that make up a Best Picture nominee can be found in Logan. It has drama, romance, a little humor, feels organic, deals with prejudice (by extension), and is based on a book– a comic book that is. The R rating is also important because it (1) serves as further evidence in the direction Fox is going to proceed with films like Deadpool and X-Force–gearing toward an adult audience (2) it allowed for audiences to see the Wolverine at full bloody force, which has been a desire for quite sometime and (3) the degree to which the film can deal with real adult problems physiologically and emotionally. The financial success of Logan will depend on adult audiences speaking the word about the outstanding nature of the film and even bringing more mature younger superhero fans to see the movie. Since most of the film contains disturbing imagery in regards to both the bloody violence and with Professor X's debilitating cognitive disorder (most likely a severe form of dementia), I would not recommend bringing those under 13 to the film until you have screened it for yourself. It's an incredible, film; but, there is content that may not sit well with those that are quite young.Before Logan begins, fans of Deadpool will be excited to know that there is a short film (glorified promo, really) for Deadpool that does a successful job at promoting the highly anticipated sequel to last year's blockbuster. Its placement is also important to Logan in that it provides some levity before the rather somber tone of the feature film that follows Ryan Reynolds' offensively endearing witty charm as Deadpool. Logan is proof that superhero films can take the more serious route without sacrificing the art of the story. Both Jackman's and Stewart's acting is on point, and probably some of the best of their respective careers. Stewart, more specifically, delivers a command performance as Professor X and demonstrates that an accomplished actor who was primarily first known as Captain Picard can excel in both the horror (Green Room) and superhero genre films, all the while continually adding the touch of class that comes with his formal Shakespearean training as a performing artist.This is NOT repeat NOT a kids superhero movie. Unless you have screen the film first, I would not recommend bringing anyone under the age of 13 with you to the cinema for Logan. There may not be ""adult"" content in the conventional sense; but, there are themes, subtext, and some violent content that may not be suitable for a younger audience who typically flock to superhero genre movies. Over all, Logan is an outstanding film, not just of the superhero variety, but also in general. From the writing to the directing and technical elements, this movie is a fantastic example of a superhero film that attempts to be and successes at breaking the mold and cementing itself as serious cinema.","

No surprise there thoughIt's the perfect ending for a Hugh's portrayal of Wolverine, arguably the best Wolverine there's beenGreat villain in X-23 and Donald Pierce, played brilliantly by Boyd Halbrook who I really liked in 'Narcos' alsoThe editing I thought was really well done also, as well as the screenplay. Some early scenes with Logan and Charles have some great writingConsNone!Overall, I thought 'Logan' was sensational and for me it is easily the best Wolverine film and if we could compare it to the X-Men films, then I would also put 'Logan' at the top of that list. Yes, it's a film that oozes emotion out of the audience and your meant to feel that way, but I will certainly be watching this over and over again. Great performances by all and there's really not much to dislike about this.Quote - ""Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.""Rating - 10/10","

"Logan","paulijcalderon","1 March 2017","I'm emotionally devastated right now. I'm a fan of the ""X-Men"" saga and I heard this was Hugh Jackman's swansong to the character of Wolverine. Meaning he intends this to be his final time playing that part. And plus he is caring for a weak and humble Patrick Stewart. So I was already invested and a bit emotional going in because I got sad seeing these two characters in this state. These are people I care for and I feel like I know them at this point. There's been so many films with them and it all lead up to this moment. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it, but I went in and... It exceeded my expectations. I loved it. I'm not gonna spoil anything because I think you should see. I don't even know what to write really, I'm really speechless.This is a film that dares to go the extra mile and I applaud them for making an honest humble story and not this big extravaganza. Here the story and characters come first before all the action. Which I gotta say, The action was fantastic. It's extremely brutal and violent. Patrick Stewart gives a heartbreaking performance that's full of range. He is funny, crazy and wise. You feel really bad for him and seeing him be happy and remind Logan of the good values in life really got me. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal. This is ""THE"" performance from him.It's a tragic movie too. A lot of scenes actually made me teary eyed. There's so much in this that broke me that I'm still unable to shake the emotions off. This film is something special. I will say that this is the first time I've seen an entire audience stay until the credits ended. Why you ask? Well, because everyone was waiting for a Post-credit scene. There is no extra scene at the end, so you don't have to wait. Some guys started booing because there was nothing extra. I usually stay for the credits, but I don't think this movie needed an extra scene. It's perfect as it is. One negative I can find is that villain was stock. There's not much to him.That's it for now. I could talk about this film for hours, but I would have to go into Spoiler territory. My overall thoughts are that I think it's phenomenally exciting and heartbreaking. Go watch it.","

"Logan","jherrick-6-991336","10 March 2017","I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.""Logan"" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called ""The Westchester Incident"", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the ""Westchester Incident""), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the ""R"" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the ""R"" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of ""Deadpool"" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie ""Jurassic Park"", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For ""Deadpool"" it works. You can't do ""Deadpool"" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who ""Deadpool"" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated ""upgrades"" now don't make a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like ""Logan"" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, ""Logan"" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of ""The Walking Dead"" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else.","

Wolverine fighting climate change might have been a more entertaining storyline.And at the end Wolverine just takes a lot of drugs goes into a rage and kills all the bad guys. Who didn't see something like that coming.Wolverine kill moves were kind of cool in this movie, but doing that same claw through the face move in slow motion over and over gets pretty boring after a while. Its always some cliché bad guy, too. If Wolverine would do the claw through the face move on random ""climate deniers"", that could be entertaining.And I don't understand how crossing the border into Canada is going to help these mutant children. As if a multi-billion dollar organization of super evil bad guys rampantly killing all over the USA can't get the papers to go to Canada? And I'm pretty sure those kids crossing the border didn't get any papers either.","

The best part of this movie was the casting and great performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newcomer Dafne Keen.However, if you are looking for a dark movie about the mistreatment of children strongly prefer the horror film ""The Girl With All the Gifts"" which has a stronger story, unique science fiction elements and includes social commentary.Logan is a gritty, thriller in which our anti-hero feels a lot like just another Jack Bauer, Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne with a plot that feels like we're watching a grim, drug-addled, violent downer of a drama i.e. Traffic, Training Day, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas — not a comic book superhero.To the marketers credit, this was as advertised — ""Logan"" not Wolverine with a Johnny Cash/Kurt Cobain soundtrack.

The leads are sick and dying, and the fights throw out flying and weather control in favor of what is basically a series of violent martial arts blade fights. This is a very dark movie with a high death toll and a consistent bleak sense of place. It is emotionally powerful and surprisingly uncompromising within the movie superhero world, although it's still full of exciting action sequences.At the same time, I think it's easy to be overly impressed with this movie because it's so different from a typical superhero movie. Some viewers are responding to Logan as though director Mangold has created a movie for the ages. I think that's pushing it a bit. But it is an absolutely terrific movie.","

"Logan","eddie_baggins","5 March 2017","Since his debut on screen in 2000's X-Men, grizzled mutant Logan aka Wolverine became a fan favourite, the poster boy for the then budding new series and a career defining role for Australia's very own favourite son Hugh Jackman.A lot has changed since that memorable debut in Bryan Singer's well-liked comic book hit, for Wolverine as a character, most of that revolves around a lot of crumby cameos and forgettable solo adventures but proving once and for all that good things come to those that wait, Jackman and his The Wolverine director James Mangold have decided enough was enough and finally given the many fans of the clawed mutant the film they've been calling out for.Logan, a downright glum and violent affair is very far from the ""perfect"" film but considering where this character has come from and where it seemed like he was likely to stay, Mangold's film is one worthy of the name and this Western inspired road trip provides a sense of closure when it comes to the Wolverine name, in that we can finally say Jackman did all he could with this creation that gave birth to his enjoyable international career.A film that ends up being slightly too long in the claw, Logan is 130 minutes of dust covered, blood strewn and anti-children's entertainment that leverages Marvel's new found ""older"" audience targeting that did them so well with Deadpool and their Netflix events, as a now withered and old Logan is trying to live a quiet life as a driver for hire whilst supporting an ailing Professor X only to be thrown headfirst into a violent battle to protect mutant child Laura who acts as a surrogate daughter to the bearded ex-hero.This set-up allows Mangold and Jackman to explore Logan on a deeper level, as the near suicidal man struggles to find meaning behind his sombre existence and Jackman delivers his best turn yet as the character while many fanboys will appreciate the time he gets to spend with Professor X (who I would argue gets too much screen time uttering Logan's name on repeat for the majority) and it's a chance to finally see the famed mutant act out some seriously impressive carnage.The action in Logan is where the film truly shines and from the film's opening minutes you're acutely aware that this is not a film you'll be watching with the younger members of your family.Limbs are lopped, chopped, sliced and diced and Mangold isn't afraid to linger on the killing that sometimes needs to be done and for all those years we've endured rather forgettable Wolverine fight scenes, Logan certainly does more than enough to make up for this.With action a high point of the film, Logan's not so amazing moments come from a story that starts to drag come the final stretches and with a finale that will be far from many people's memories come a few months' time, it feels as though Logan wasn't entirely sure of itself when it came to delivering the goods come the films conclusion.It's nice to see Marvel shy away from ""city destruction"" and an evil villain that just wants to take over the world but you can't help but feel the earlier beginnings of Logan signposted a far more ""epic"" final act, not one with a bunch of children running around a forest and a bottle of peptides.A fine final outing for Jackman and his Wolverine to be a part of, Logan is without doubt the best solo Wolverine adventure and easily one of the best X-Men orientated feature films that draws out Jackman's best performance in some time and introduces us to newcomer Dafne Keen, who does a great job in her portrayal of Laura.There's nothing truly ground-breaking here but it's certainly refreshing to see Marvel willing to keep expanding their horizons and deliver different takes on stories and characters that have flooded our cinema screens for nearly two decades and while this overlong trip is lacking a little in the emotional stakes and features a few to many corny circumstances, it's unlikely the images of Logan enacting out his sweet form of justice will be forgotten anytime soon.3 ½ bowls of cornflakes out of 5","

"Logan","gerick_goldwyn","2 May 2017","I am absolutely stunned that this film has received so much positive feedback online; when I couldn't be more disappointed! It's by far the worst Marvel film we have seen to date. The story line was incredibly weak – I personal believe it was written by a 12-year-old child – and the movie itself, is set during another random messed up future time line, which completely falls out of sync with the rest of the X-Men (or Marvel) films we have seen to-date. Once again, this movie failed to capture (or portray) Wolverine's character properly. The closest we've seen so far is: The Wolverine (2013). However, my biggest criticism is: I am so sick to death of seeing Wolverine fight at a disadvantage. It's like he has a permanent piece of Kryptonite rammed so far up his ass, he is incapable of fighting properly. In the first Wolverine film (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), we were forced to watch him fight with the indignity of bone claws; I wasn't very happy when Marvel added bone claws to Wolverine's mutation in 1994, when in the previous 20 years, his claws were always the result of the Weapon X project. Not some bizarre, gross mutation. However, since it was an Origin story, I can bring myself to overlook this. In the second film (The Wolverine), his powers were suppressed by Viper (or that machine attached to his heart), and in this film (Logan), we were forced to watch him: as a tired, broken down, old man. It's so disappointing You might notice, when we watch all the other Marvel superheros on screen, they're all fighting at full strength (or in their prime); not at 10 or 20 percent of their working capacity. I want to see Wolverine completely cut lose! Is that too much to ask!! In the Avengers (or in the Captain America films), we see Captain America seriously kick ass, he is awesome, and so are all the Avengers. Even Spiderman and Ant-man kicked ass in the last Avengers film. We have never seen Wolverine shown in that light before. Half the time Wolverine is getting his ass kicked by random no bodies, and there is never a mission impossible factor involved. I cannot believe Disney don't get that God, it's pathetic!! I think we could have seen Wolverine fight at his best if he joined the Avengers, and I would have loved to seen Hugh Jackman join the team. He probably would have stolen the spotlight though.I am also getting a bit sick and tired of seeing Marvel (or Disney now) releasing a X-Men film with no concept of who the X-Men are, what the series is all about, and what the characters are all capable of. In the first X-Men movie for example, Mystique and Rogue are mortal enemies, when in the comic book series, Mystique is actually Rogues adopted mother, so they would never harm one another, and their relationship is critical to the Rogues eventual story. In X2 and X-Men 3, Jean was given the power of the Phoenix Force, when the Phoenix's abilities were never part of her natural mutation. In X-Men 3, Professor X and Juggernaut weren't even step brothers, and in the final X-Men film: Apocalypse, Mystique and Nightcrawler were roughly the same age, when Mystique is Nightcrawlers biological mother, and there are errors or inconsistencies like this throughout the entire X-Men (film) series. With this film for example, Laura has the exact same mutation (or powers) as Wolverine; that isn't how mutations work, identical powers aren't passed from father to son. I can provide 1000 examples on this point but I won't. God!! Does anyone actually read the comic books over there at Disney?! Just imagine tuning into a random episode of Game of Thrones and none of the Lannisters are related, the Tyrion Lannister (the Imp) is a Giant (and is as dump as a box of hair) and Winterfell is in the South rather than the North, which is completely being run by the White Walkers under the blistering sun. You would think: if Hollywood was going to make a movie based on Games of Thrones, they could at least get these facts right – or is that asking too much? Apparently so I feel that's what the X-Men (film) series has become now. I feel it's become nothing more than a jumbled mess of random crap, and we're supposed to praise Marvel (or Disney) for their work. This movie was nothing more than another messed up alternate future, where mutates have largely been wiped out. So in the next X-Men film, are we going to see another time traveler go back in time and fixes thing because Marvel (or Disney) are incapable of producing a decent X-Men film. That's going to get, real old real fast. Whoever wrote this film has no concept of who Wolverine is or what the X-Men is all about! They came close in X- Men: First Class, X- Men: Days of Future Past and The Wolverine. I know these movies have inconsistencies compared to the comics but at least they came close to capturing what the X-Men is all about. However, this movie (Logan) was a complete mess, and only encourages me NOT to see anymore X-Men films at the movies! And, I won't be ever again! The X-Men has so much potential on the big screen but Disney seems determine to screw it all up! You know, get your sh*t together people, we deserve much better","

"Logan","darkreignn","10 March 2017","""Logan"" isn't good because it's rated R; it's good because it's one of the most emotional and intense superhero movie in years. It's involving, it's dramatic, it's emotionally draining, and it's spectacular.Starring Hugh Jackman, ""Logan"" is about a broken, beaten down, and tired Wolverine. He's tired of fighting. He's tired of helping people. He just wants to be left alone, and if being left alone takes an adamantium bullet in his skull, then so be it. ""Heartbreaking"" is one word to describe what it feels like to watch our beloved Wolverine in this state; ""gut-wrenching"" is another. In fact, this film feels like one big continuous sucker punch to the emotions over and over. It's plain sad to see Logan in this manner, and it's even sadder to see him slice and dice and gore his enemies. Like I mentioned, he doesn't want to fight. But yet, people still seem eager to fight him, and with every stab to the face and slice to the gut, the sadness becomes more tangible. The violence is so brutal and animalistic that you don't actually want to see Logan kill anyone, because he himself doesn't want to kill anyone. Killing people is all he's ever done and the more he does it the worse he feels. It's hard to watch, but it's effective. Wolverine growls, yells, and screams as he rips people to shreds, and it's like watching an animal tear into its prey. Be warned, this movie is graphic and full of extreme violence that will wear you down and exhilarate you at the same time. It's hard for me to describe exactly what it feels like watching the action scenes, but you'll know what I mean once you see the film for yourself. But this isn't to say that the action isn't cool to watch, because you best believe it is. Wolverine goes nuts in this movie, tearing arms off and stomachs open. It's brutal and it's badass and it's honestly beautiful.Hugh Jackman gives a performance so Oscar worthy that if he doesn't get nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role I may never watch the Academy Awards again. Seriously, it's a performance that you'd never expect in a big budget superhero film. He reminded me a lot of Tobey Maguire in the first three ""Spider-Man"" films; Hugh was subtle and nuanced, with pain and frustration in his eyes. But when he went berserk, he held nothing back. And Dafne Keen was probably one of the best child actresses I've ever seen. The other child actors in this film? That's a different story, but she was magnificent. Patrick Stewart was amazing, do I even need to say that? It was a bit weird to hear Professor X cuss so much, but I understood why, and if I lived in that world you better believe I'd be saying the f-word as much as he does, too.This isn't a perfect movie though. Around the halfway point the film introduced a character that mildly took me out of the movie, but I can't deny that the introduction of that character brought forth some of the most intense, nail biting, and exciting fight scenes I've EVER seen. I was seriously holding my breath during the first fight scene with this character, and I didn't even notice it until the fight ended; that's how engrossing this movie is. I also disliked how little tension some of the fight scenes had. Most actions scenes feature Logan fighting a handful of evil goons, and it's fun to watch, but it's nothing we haven't seen before (except for the graphic nature of the violence). Don't get me wrong, the action was amazing, I just wish there were a few more creative set pieces instead of just having Wolverine fight some expendable goons every 25 minutes.There is also a scene of obvious, immersion breaking exposition, and the story is almost nothing new, but the fact of the matter is we've never seen Wolverine in a story like this before, and that's what makes this movie fresh. Seeing Wolverine in this broken, beaten down way is painful, but it's an intense and gripping watch. ""Logan"" is definitely one of the best superhero movies that has been released in a long, long time and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.","

"Logan","bob-the-movie-man","18 March 2017","At last – a superhero movie with real heart (and not just the chunks over the knuckle blades!). Logan is a bit of a revelation. I was reluctant to go and see it, since a) I'm a lukewarm X-Men fan at best and b) I hadn't seen either of the previous two Wolverine spin-off films. (Seeing the other Wolverine films, by the way, is not a pre- requisite for enjoying this one). After a long day at work, my choice was ""Logan"" or ""Kong: Skull Island"". I voted for this one, and I'm so glad I did.It's now 2029. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, but this is not a Wolverine we have seen before. This is an aged and deteriorating superhero: his self-healing powers are waning; a limp is developing; and his fighting prowess (although still legendary) doesn't show the stamina it once did. This is a Wolverine that is also an unlikely carer, looking after a mentally degenerating Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), now 90 years old and finding it increasingly difficult to keep his devastating mental superpowers under control. This is a Wolverine trying desperately to avoid the limelight, working diligently as a limo-driver in an effort to save money for the dream of buying a 'Sunseeker' and sailing off with Xavier into the sunset, gaining true anonymity among the boating fraternity.Life doesn't play ball though. A brutal encounter with a gang on the highway outside El Paso advertises Wolverine's presence and brings him into contact with a strange eleven-year-old girl (Dafne Keen) with impressive powers of her own. The girl is being pursued by a ""reiver"" (Boyd Holbrook, ""Run all Night"") supported by a small private army. Against his will, Wolverine is forced into a memorable road trip with the old man and the young girl that leaves a trail of bloodied bodies behind them.For, be warned, this is an *extremely* violent film, with much dismemberment and 'blade work' that must have kept the prosthetics department busy for months. It's also quite emotionally brutal, particularly within a central segment set in a ""Field of Dreams"" style idyll (featuring Eriq La Salle from E.R.) that you know in your gut is not going to end with ""Goodnight John Boy"" pleasantries.The well-choreographed and frenetic action within the road-trip segment reminded me at times of the harsh cinematography and dynamics of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" – a great compliment.But the film also takes time to pause, in uncharacteristic Marvel- ways, for character development and genuinely intelligent dialogue. These interludes allow the acting to shine, and it is first-rate. We all know (from ""Les Miserables"" for instance) that Hugh Jackman can act, but this is arguably his best-ever performance: a meaty role (he actually has two in the film) that affords him tremendous range and emotion. At one point towards the end of the film I thought ""this has genuine Oscar show-reel potential"". He will surely never get nominated – a Marvel film? Get Away! But wouldn't it make a refreshing change if he was? Recognizing good acting, regardless of the context.Patrick Stewart is a great Shakespearean actor, and here he also gets given full rein to impress as he hasn't had chance to in most of his movie roles to date. Claiming the prize so far this year for the most unusual casting decision is Stephen Merchant as the albino helper Caliban, unrecognizable to me at first until he had some lengthy dialogue to flex his Bristol accent on! A non-comic and dramatic role, Merchant does really well with it. Finally, I can't leave the acting without doffing my cap to young Dafne Keen whose mesmerising feral stare would probably put the fear of God into every parent of a pre-teen girl! Even though she has only a handful of lines, this is an impressive feature film debut. I predict we will see much more of this young lady.Less convincing to me was Richard E Grant as the evil mastermind behind the scheme, who never quite seemed nasty enough to me to be believable: in one scene he could be calling back a dog that's run off down the beach rather than desperately trying to gain control of an out of control situation! Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Knight and Day""), who co-wrote the piece with Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") and Michael Green (""Green Lantern"" yes, really!), this was a gritty and well constructed movie. If you can stomach the gore and the body count (I would see it as very lucky to have got away with its UK '15' certificate) this is a roller-coaster of a movie that is recommended.By the way, to save you from sitting through the end titles (although you do get a Johnny Cash classic to enjoy) there is no ""monkey"" at the end of this Marvel film. (I'm no stranger to still be sitting there as the lights come up but many of the crowd that were left looked vaguely embarrassed!) In terms of my rating, I'm not a fanboy for Marvel or DC properties, but here I award a rating I have only previously bestowed on two superhero films before: the quirky ""Ant Man"" and the anarchic ""Deadpool"". Well worth seeing on the big screen.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).","

"Logan","cdjh-81125","6 August 2017","Logan isn't really what I'd call a superhero movie it's more of a neo-western meets a road trip movie meets a family drama and it worked exceptionally. I was not as excited for this movie as much as everyone else, the trailers just weren't truly speaking to me but the final product absolutely did and is one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever viewed. The direction they took the character of Logan in this film was not something I had expected, we've seen him at his absolute lows and his points where he was truly without hope but never like this, we've never seen him suicidal with absolutely nothing left to fight for and it made his arc in the film all the more satisfying. To see him Ben forced back into helping someone one last time but in himself old and weakened state was at times hard to watch but at the same time very captivating knowing that this truly is his last fight. Another character who's direction surprised me with the direction that they took was that of Charles Xavier, to see someone we've seen be a beacon of hope and an inspirational figure as a now weak and frail old man was not what I signed on for when I started watching this movie but i greatly admired what they did here, to see him in a light we've never seen before truly showed us that this film was going to be different. As much as I was excited to see Hugh Jackman play his signature role for the final time I was saddened by the fact I would never see him take up the claws again but Jackman absolutely nailed it one final time. He brought a real harshness, sickly and vulnerable presence to this performance in both a physical and a emotional way, he truly gave one of the greatest performances ever in a comic book movie. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart one gave such a heartbreaking performance that often left me saddened yet captivated by the complete commitment to his final performance as this character. Newcomer Dafne Keen absolutely held her own in this movie in a very physical performance match with her great chemistry with Jackman and Stewart. I've never been an advocate of R-Rated comic book films, or for any film really, I just don't like the idea of needless violence and excessive language being put into a film needlessly but I truly loved how this film used its R-Rating. It made truly apparent that this was different from any of the other films in the franchise, it made it feel much more gritty and real and allowed director James Mangold to take the action to its full extent by fully exploiting the capabilities of the titular characters powers, this film is plenty bloody and violent but is used as a tool to show the reality of the situation for its characters and against all my worries was not something I found to be an unnecessary addition to this film. Like I said this film isn't like other comic book movies, it has a real slowness to it as well as a good heart and grit. Plenty of scenes are devoted to simply interaction among characters and their conversations all of which feel like valuable conclusions and added something to this movie. Is definitely one of the more slow paced films of this franchise but never feels boring or uninteresting as it's full of characters we've come to know and love which makes it feel more valuable knowing that it is there final few hours of screen time. I don't think this is a perfect movie, I did have a few issues with it. For one the villains, I really enjoyed Boyd Holbrook in this movie he was a very charismatic character he wasn't very deep but he had a nice presence to him that made him enjoyable as a character. The same cannot be said for Xander Rice or The Reavers, I found them to be extremely conventional and generic. The Reavers were expendable foot soldiers who only served to see Jackman and Keen in full R-Rated fashion. Rice was a fairly bland character who had iffy motivations and didn't really do anything of consequence on screen. I also found the last act to be a bit mixed, now the last 10 minutes were incredibly, extremely emotionally fulfilling material, but before that felt very rushed, as if the filmmakers had established so many plot lines that they desperately needed to wrap up before the film ended. I didn't particularly care for the new characters they introduced here and felt like a bit an underwhelming addition. While it's not my favourite if the X-Men franchise it is most definitely the most emotionally satisfying and fulfilling. It had a nice heart and message, fantastic action, performances and character arcs that truly wrapped up the character of Wolverine in a masterful fashion that made me realise just how much a cherish the characters of the franchise and how much I'll miss them now that they time is at an end. 8.8/10: A- (Fantastic)","

"Logan","martin-alejandro","8 March 2017","When you think of Marvel and X-men, what comes to your mind is entertainment and action. However, in this film its main focus is more about being sentimental. While the action, the acting and the connection of the characters is the best from this film, it is the way that the characters are written which makes it disappointing.The plot is that Logan/Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) goes on a journey reluctantly to help a mutant girl named Laura (who is Wolverine's daughter), to find her other mutant friends who are chased by a group composed of cyborg enforces called, ""The Reavers"" along with their cyborg leader named, Donald Pierce (played by Robert Holbrook).Now the plot sounds simple and entertaining but it is the mishandling of the X-men hero characters that ruins the plot along with its message about the elderly people and its questionable conclusion. First of all, Logan/Wolverine is shown to be a drunken X-men character who works as a chauffeur while suffering a disease that is making him weak because of the adamantium that was fused to his bones. We are never told how he ended up in this situation but you just have to accept it. Also, Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) still has his power of telepathy but because he is old, he suffers from seizures and cannot recognize Wolverine unless he takes his medicine although Xavier does state that he is aware of his telepathic power.Now unlike the comic, ""The Reavers"" have no interest in destroying the X-men mutant but rather a group of mutant children who have superpowers but have escaped (Note: In this film, the mutant children want to cross the border from Mexico to the U.S. for a new opportunity of life). Inadvertently, Wolverine is caught in the middle of the chase. The first conflict that I had is that during the film, Wolverine, Professor Xavier and Laura are given a shelter by a kind family called, the Munsons. Despite the family's good deed and kindness, the Munsons are slaughtered by X-24 (a clone of Wolverine who works for the antagonists) who is sent to capture Laura. At this point it shows you that being good and kind means death according to the message of this film (Logan). To add insult to injury, Professor Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath is easily killed by X-24 because he is old and old people suck (based on the message that this film, Logan, is giving). After Wolverine escapes with Laura and they find the mutant children, ""The Reavers"" along with X-24 arrive but they are defeated by the mutant children and Wolverine. During the fight against X-24, Wolverine is brutally impaled onto a tree stump. Luckily Wolverine survives his injury, and knowing that the mutant children have no guidance of what is good and justice while also being aware that the mutant children were only taught to destroy humanity, he decides to take them under his guide were he establishes a private school like Xavier for the mutant childrenyeah that doesn't happen.Instead after being impaled onto a tree stump, Wolverine dies from his wounds because well, he is old and old people suck (based on the message of this film). The children bury him and continue their journey as the credits roll but there is one problem THIS MUTANT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO END UP JUST LIKE THE REAVERS! With no guidance of what is right and justice, and with only the teachings that they were taught which is to destroy humanity, this mutant kids will actually become a new villainous group on the Marvel world of this film. Special criticism is also given to the fact that there is not the traditional Marvel post-credits scene and Stan Lee does not make a cameo appearance. In conclusion, this 2017 film, ""Logan,"" gives the feeling that its director James Mangold (who also directed the 2013 film, Wolverine), its writers and its producers, hate life, they hate the Marvel heroes (Wolverine and Professor Xavier) and they have no respect for the elderly people as they see them as useless without taking note that the elderly people have a greater knowledge and that the youth can learn from them. The whole film just mocks Wolverine and Professor Xavier for being too old and it does not take note of their achievements as a hero or the great power and knowledge that they poses. Instead The message of this film is that no matter what accomplishments you've done in the past and no matter if you have done the right thing or if you are a hero, it is pointless because that was in the past. As a result, it means that since you are old, you suck and are no longer needed according to this film's message. If you are a fan of X-men, Marvel and Wolverine, then this movie is highly not recommendable for you. But if you like Soap opera and you are a fan of Hugh Jackman, then this film is for you.","

"Logan","RforFilm","7 March 2017","With a set of metal claws, an ability to heal from wounds, and a Clint Eastwood-like attitude, you get the superhero animal known as Wolverine. Within the X-Men comics, Wolverine has become one of the most iconic and popular characters of not just that team, but for Marvel in general. While some of that comes down to a neat design, the character of feels the roughest of personalities. This has allowed him to confront his enemies with more of a street-smart mindset that the other X-Men lack. It also helps that his regeneration practically makes him the perfect shield for the other heroes.His cinematic outings have worked thanks to the casting of Hugh Jackman. He manages to carry the necessary roughness with the combination of the actor's charisma. What this makes is a Wolverine that remains popular even though he has never worn the famous costume from the comics. This is simply excellent direction. It makes sense that the actor wouldn't be able to play the character forever and had to exit at some point. Had it not been for the critically acclaimed Old Man Logan comic, writers might still be searching for a good idea. What comes for Wolverines final cinematic story is Logan. Set in 2029 sometime after X-Men: Apocalypse, the mutants are close to being extinct due to no new ones being born in a while. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) has aged considerably now that his healing is much slower and the metal that's attached to his skeleton and claws is poisoning him. He works as a chauffeur and caring for Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) who is retired and suffering a disease that causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities and memory loss. A nurse approaches Logan asking for safe transport to North Dakota for her and her child Laura. Logan agrees for a payment, but finds that nurse murdered the morning they were supposed to leave. When he returns home, he finds Laura in the trunk. Not too long later is when Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) comes with a security team to kill Laura. During the battle, it's discovered that Laura has a similar set of claws and a similar regeneration power like Wolverines. Logan, Xavier, and Laura escape and hit the road to drive north. What they're hoping for is the last chance for mutants to continue. Not only does the movie contain a lot of story elements that I don't want to spoil, but it contains a lot of acting moments that are also worth keeping secret. It's rare to find a ""three"" movie that's the best of a series, but Logan seems to be that specialty. Not only is it the darkest and most violent (it takes full advantage of the R rating), but it's also the most mature. What I mean by that is that this feels like a very adult story regarding aging, politics about minorities, and even genuine drama between Wolverine and Laura. Out of all the X-Men movies, Logan is the least superhero of all, and that's a good thing. Hugh Jackman's Logan plays off more like a cowboy as his character practically refuses to be the hero that most audiences have identified him as. He's more weary and damaged then before, and his performance reminds you of a scar that contains a good story. By the end, you'll not only be fighting off tears, but feel that the song use of Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" is worth it. Logan is without a doubt, the best of the X-Men series (yes, even over Deadpool).I'll give this nine Wolverines out of ten. In the ages of capes and super villains, it's refreshing to see something that's more grounded. It takes inspiration from the right places (Shane, Children of Men, etc) and uses it's action to it's full advantage to make the perfect last ride for good old Wolverine","

"Logan","lesleyharris30","1 April 2017","Logan is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast that are all given time to shine. It is completely unlike any other superhero film, it has a gritty, western vibe throughout, scenery and cinematography that you will not see in any other X- Men film, and dialogue heavy moments with no action, this really is groundbreaking work. What really surprised me about this film is that you can go in to it completely blind, you do not have to have seen any other X-Men film, it stands on its own. I did feel the movie could have been a bit more sentimental. Considering the fact that it's the finale for Wolverine and Charles, there is little reflection. There is one beautiful moment where they speak about first meeting each other, I would love to have had more moments like that, to showcase the history they have with each other. It is certainly sad watching this movie knowing that this is the last time we will ever see Hugh Jackman and Patrick Steawart in their very famous roles, but they certainly went out with a bang. The connection between them here is stronger than ever, they are both clearly at ease with one another and it makes for pure, natural acting. Dafne Keen also shines as Laura, for such a young girl she seemed well capable of holding a strong character throughout, and her chemistry with Jackman and Stewart is very sweet. Stephen Merchant also surprised me, I was expecting him to be comic relief and thought that he would have felt very out place in this universe, but he is actually stellar in this role, delivering little humorous dialogue, he completely transforms. You will walk away with great sadness, but also feeling like they could not have closed off these characters arch's any better way. Dark, action packed, well acted and grounded, Logan is a must see for all X-Mem fans, as well if you are looking for a good action or drama. When Logan and Charles discover a young mutant, they must hide her from dark forces and search for more of her kind. Best Performance: Hugh Jackman","

"Logan","twbond-00867","10 February 2021","Logan (2017) is a gripping, emotional, and superb ending to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine trilogy. His story concludes so surprisingly, and hangs up his claws the way he should. The relationship between him and the elderly, weakening Professor X played by the great Sir Patrick Stewart is heart-warming, fantastic and emotional for the X-Men fans who have watched the franchise since the first film.The story is set in the future, and the year is 2029, and the whole of the X-Men, except the two leads have been wiped out. The two remaining core members of the X-Men are just about holding on, and Logan's mutation is weakening. The story revolves around a father-daughter connection, having Logan to escort the young mutant ""X-23"", also known as Laura, to a place called Eden, and throughout the journey, Logan is slowly wearing; he is dying! And yes, Spoiler Alert; he and the Professor don't make it.Dir. James Mangold has exceeded beyond the X-Men baseline, and has really delivered a satisfying conclusion to Wolverine's saga. Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart IS the father figure Logan also wanted. He IS Professor X (James McAvoy also did a great job). I would've love to of seen a final farewell with Logan and Erik Lensherr/Magneto, but what Mangold has done is pure perfection, and if you have followed the X-Men franchise, then this is a real tearjerker for you all.Logan (2017) is a memorable movie!
10/10, you won't be disappointed!","

"Logan","gunn-wrights","8 February 2023","IMHO - Logan is the worst major character of all the X-men. He acts like a total tool, he's made of metal (the material that can be manipulated by the #1 guy they fight, Magneto). He can't fly, manipulate minds, or fight from any distance beyond the length of his arms hell, he can't even make my tea cold!With that said, this movie was actually pretty good! Tons of ACTION - rarely a dull moment! We get a new enemy (rather than the same story of mutant vs. Mutant clans). Even better was the heroes were mostly children - so, a very different type X-Men movieThe ending felt kind of flat, and disappointing - that's probably my biggest complaint!RECOMMENDATION: Even if you're not a huge fan of the Logan/Wolverine character - this movie is EXCELLENT!","

"Logan","RealLiveClaude","23 June 2020","We all know that Hugh Jackman's run as Logan a.k.a. the Wolvering and Patrick Stewart's as Professor Xavier would end this way, however, this ends in a spectacular way.Lots of action, suspense in a pursuit to protect a new generation of mutants created after the last one was decimated slowly...Logan, now worn out, alcoholic and disabused, must protect a young girl who accidentally is same as his alter ego: an almost invincible human, with claws, whom the Wolverine really is...However, he will not be the only one... A nemesis of the same type might be on the way...Good acting, and of course, a last farewell to Professor X and Wolverine..This is a good way to end the X-men saga... and start another one...","

"Logan","Gresh854","15 March 2017","Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, ""The Dark Knight"" of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and cliché. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an ""A"" and a IMDb score of a 10/10.","

"Logan","MihaiSorinToma","30 June 2017","In not very distant future a fatigued Logan who cares for an apparently mindless Charles finds his routine life disturbed by a young mutant who's being hunted by an army of mercenaries. Despite his unfortunate condition, he agrees to escort the young one to the border for safety, but the bad guys are determined to stop them at any cost.While this plot sounds a bit simplistic and even somewhat cliché, it does its job well, bringing suspense and thrill along the way. Although it doesn't have the epic action and intensity as the X-Men movies, it manages to create a bleary atmosphere in which his events become darker and darker until the predictable but tragic finale. I enjoyed this movie which made me feel strange though, seeing an almost powerless and struggling Wolverine in his attempt to protect the young mutant.It's a good movie, but not as great as its overall rating. You can get sentimental, especially when this movie is supposed to mark the retreat of Logan, but from my point of view, the X-Men movies are better as they provide more action and awesomeness, aspects for which you see such a movie in the first place.","

"Logan","reisen55","12 March 2017","This was a disappointment for me and my wife and I walked out of it half way through, worse when you WANT to like a film as the entire X-Men franchise and the other half, owned by Marvel, as they all comprise good, solid entertainment. Funniest thing was the first five min and then downhill from there. This is a mean, nasty film, not one character is likable and just something far from taking mind away from problems on a weekend. I know many here think this is the CITIZEN KANE of action - X - superhero films and I suppose I could see ..... nope, cannot see that viewpoint. The X-Men series dies a bad death for me. Hell, the Fox logo in the beginning did not even highlight the X for a moment or two.Wasted my money totally. Going to a bar for a solid drink.","

"Logan","phoenixinvictus","18 April 2017","I found this movie to be disappointing, boring and confusing. If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it. There is barely any action in the movie and the whole second act is dull. Logan takes place in the year 2029, with technology that is barely more advanced than our 2017, there's an evil corporation complete with henchmen and they want to weaponize mutating kids to create killers. What a surprise! For some unexplained reason Canada is a magical land with a magical border that is able to repel bad guys and evil corporations. Maybe they have mutated Mounties guarding them In almost every X-Man movie the technology is always super advanced, with invisible planes, flying robots and holographic simulators, but all that technology seems to have vanished along with all the mutants. After having lived for over a century we finally see Logan is not only is ageing, but also dying. The movie never really explains why he no longer is able to regenerate except for a hint that the adamantium is somehow poisoning him. We also never get a reasonable explanation of what happened in ""Westchester"" other than that Xavier may have killed everyone with one of his seizures and who now has a mental illness. Wasn't there any signs of Xavier's illness? People with mental illnesses don't just snap from one moment to the next. Couldn't they have given him an injection of some sort like they did in another movie? This movie glossed over twenty years of back stories that wants to make me want to shake my head. Maybe they'll time travel their problems away in a reboot where things aren't so confusing. The plot holes are abundant and so I rate this movie with a capital B for Boring.","

"Logan","michaeljtrubic","15 May 2017","Forty minutes into it and the 4th pointless action sceneThousands of rounds of bullets fired at, you guessed it, characters that aren't killed by bullets. No decipherable principal plot has emerged so far.When stars don't want to make a movie they ask for ridiculous sums of money. The studios must have the requisite action sequences so there is no money left in the budget for supporting characters or interesting locations. Just an army of minions shooting guns in the desert, that don't speak any lines, at least not in English.The studios are trapped. They are hooked on comic book franchises and those audiences that flock to them regardless of quality.We need a new rating system - this movie is rated for people younger than 18 or of diminished capacity.","

While we see a new batman/spider man reboot every year and its so tiresome, dull and boring and pointless. we just start to care less and less. I give it a 10/10 for those simple reasons. It's the best Marvel film to date. without hesitation. It's not PG13! Logan Is the Wolverine comics I grew up with. gritty and more visceral. How the director Went from this to the last Wolverine is a story I'm very curious about. Cause The Wolverine was such a bad Movie.","

"Logan","Pjtaylor-96-138044","25 April 2018","My most anticipated film of the year did not disappoint, instead proving itself to be a masterfully crafted and deeply effecting action/thriller that stays with you long after the credits roll. 'Logan (2017)' is brutal, sombre, visceral, heart-breaking, nuanced, tragic and, overall, an amazingly accomplished piece of work in every possible way. It's the culmination of all that came before, the true incarnation of this classic character, and a masterful deconstruction of the superhero genre. Not only is it one of my favourite films in that genre, but it has quickly become one of my favourite films of all time. Simply phenomenal. 9/10","

Maybe it is because I am an old guy, but the theme of the washed-out superhero doing one more feat of greatness resonates with me lol.","

"Logan","nandidot","4 March 2017","Holy Hell! My recurring thought while watching Marvel's latest outing- the unrelenting 'Logan.' I gasped, laughed, shook my head, and gritted my teeth constantly throughout the movie that will go down as one of Marvel's best ever. This is the standalone movie Wolverine has always deserved and boy does it deliver.Imagine a limping, bearded, and farsighted Wolverine as a driver for hire in true Uber fashion. The year is 2029 and mutants are no longer around save Logan aka Wolverine and an old and ailing Charles Xavier whose mind isn't quite what it used to be. They hide out far from society on the American-Mexican border where Logan frequently crosses over for work (I wonder what Trump would say to that. Though a wall wouldn't stop the clawed superhero in either case. I'm sure.) Here, Logan encounters an unusual little girl who he's told needs his help leading them on a bloody and unforgettable journey.""What the f***?"" are the first words Logan utters in the film rightfully setting the tone for the next 2.15 hours. This is uncensored greatness. It is brutal, unabashedly violent, and generously sprinkled with expletives. It's only Marvel's second R-rated movie after 'Deadpool' and let's just say this isn't the X-Men you remember from your childhood. The movie begins with a clip from Deadpool II but does a complete 180 when the title appears on screen. Unlike Deadpool, Logan isn't trying to make you laugh. It's trying to shock you. In one of the film's finest sequences, I was teetering on the edge of my seat as blood and bones engulfed a rural family home. The shock value and brilliant execution instantly took the movie to new heights. The entire theater audibly gasped.Hugh Jackman is and always will be Logan/Wolverine. He started the journey 17 years ago in 'X- Men' and recently announced that he will hang up the claws after 'Logan'. Having played the character in 8 movies (including a special appearance), Mr Jackman is as good as it gets. His performance especially in this film is sharply nuanced. He grumbles when he has to wear glasses to read and when the claws come out you're in for a real treat. He even hides a hint of a smile when an inebriated bride flashes him from his limo's backseat. Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Dafne Keen as the young Laura are perfect in their parts. But it's undoubtedly Mr. Jackman who walks away with all the glory. Being unrestrained in this movie gives him the opportunity to show us Logan's true character and he doesn't hold back. It's a hell of a ride!James Mangold has written and directed a superhero film unlike any other. You haven't seen anything like it by Marvel. The closest in terms of tone would be DC's 'The Dark Knight' but it's still an uncharacteristically original story. The only downside is it feels a little longer than it should. And it won't appeal to the fainthearted as moments of relief are few are far between. But these aren't real problems. This was a welcome watch and one that any cinema lover will relish. I haven't decided if I liked it more than 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', that might require a re-watch, but it's damn near close.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/logan/","

"Logan","jboothmillard","8 March 2017","It was massive news when it was announced that the leading actor was stepping down from the role of Wolverine, after seventeen years, this was his final outing, it was just a question of what would happen to the character, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma, The Wolverine). Basically it is the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is ageing and weakened, the adamantium fused to his body is poisoning him, meaning his healing capabilities are dwindling, he has turned to alcohol, and he works as a chauffeur. Logan is living in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, along with albino mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), there they are caring for Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, causing devastating effects to his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse for biotechnology corporation Transigen, she wants him to escort her and an eleven-year-old girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), to a place called ""Eden"", in North Dakota. Logan is also approached by Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), he turns down his offer of a job to find Gabriela and Laura for him. Logan reluctantly accepts the job for Gabriela, but he discovers she has been murdered, Pierce and his cybernetically- enhanced enforcers, the Reavers, try to kill Logan and Laura, they and Charles narrowly escape the killers, but Caliban is captured and tortured into using his capabilities to track them. Logan and Charles watch a video on Gabriela's phone, they learn that Transigen was breeding mutant children with DNA samples from several mutants for the ""X-23"" project, but as they grew up they became difficult to control, upon completion the children were deemed unnecessary and were to be killed, Gabriela helped several children escape and smuggled Laura across the border, furthermore, Laura is Logan's daughter, bred from his DNA. Laura has brought a X-Men comic, Logan finds this while they stay in Oklahoma City, in it Eden is referenced, he comes to believe Eden does not exist, the Reavers locate them, but Charles has another seizure and freezes everyone in the hotel with a psychic blast, this allows Logan to kill the enemy, but hundreds have been left injured and dozens dead, Logan injects Charles with a suppressant before they leave. A local family, the Munsons, give the trio shelter, after they help round up their horses on the highway, during the evening Charles expresses his guilt about the past, where he has a seizure that injured and kills an unknown number of people, including some X-Men. Charles thinks he is talking to Logan, it is in fact a feral Wolverine clone, X-24, that has no healing abilities and a weaker adamantium skeleton, the clone stabs Charles and slaughters the Munson family wife Kathryn (Scream 2's Elise Neal) and son Nate (Quincy Fouse), then captures Laura, Logan returns after the devastation, the injured Charles dies shortly after. Caliban sacrifices himself, destroying the van he is in with two grenades, allowing Logan and Laura to escape, Logan and X-24 clash, until the clone is impaled and shot in the head by Munson father Will (One Hour Photo's Eriq La Salle), before he dies, allowing Logan and Laura to escape. After burying Charles, Logan is rescued from a clinic by Laura, after a doctor attempts to convince him he can help his condition, Laura convinces him to let her drive them Eden, meanwhile X-24 is given a serum to regenerate by his creator Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), the head of Transigen. Logan and Laura find Eden, a safe haven for the escaped Transigen test subjects, run by mutant Rictor (Jason Genao), the children are planning to journey across the forest to the Canadian border, where there people who can help them, Logan wants to leave Laura with them, he worries his presence will endanger them. However the Reavers ambush the children in the forest, Logan uses a serum Rictor gave him to restore his healing factor, he slaughters many Reavers before the serum effects wear off. Rice confronts Logan, he reveals the destruction of mutantkind was is due to a virus created by Transigen, made to control the mutant population and weaponise them, he also mentions that Logan killed his father, Logan shoots Rice dead, and Pierce release X-24 on him. The children wipe out the remaining Reavers and kill Pierce, Logan and Laura fight X-24, Rictor uses his seismic powers in attempt to aid Logan, but caught off-guard he is impaled on a tree stump, Laura is able to kill X-24 with an adamantium bullet to the head. Fatally wounded, Logan acknowledges Laura as his daughter, he tells her not to be the weapon she was made to be, before he dies in her arms, the children mourn his death, and bury him in the woods, Laura tearfully adjusts the cross on his grave, to create an ""X"", she and the children continue their journey to cross the border and find a new beginning. Jackman has played Wolverine since the first X-Men in 2000, in a total of nine movies, including cameos and three solo movies, so speculation was obviously rife as to whether he was being killed off or replaced, the now dishevelled and more vulnerable Jackman really creates pathos, Stewart as the weakened Professor X also does fantastic in what is his final X-Men movie as well. This is a most interesting entry in the series, for its raw quality, stripping away massive set piece sequences and going down a slow-burner road movie style, and it is much more adult, more swearing and much more gory violence, you question why it is not an 18 certificate at times, it has a good script and gets you excited when it needs to, it is definitely a suitable end for the clawed superhero we loved, a great superhero action thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Very good!","

"Logan","timdalton007","29 May 2017","There is the old saying that tells us that ""all good things must end."" For Hugh Jackman, the actor who has played Marvel's comic book character Wolverine since 2000, now would seem a good time to say goodbye to the character. Thus Logan, released earlier this year, was announced to be his last time in the role. Not only that but the film looked to be quiet different from any of the previous X-Men films or even the solo Wolverine outings. The resulting film is an interesting piece of work to say the least.A large portion of what makes the film different is its tone from the script through to the performances. If previous films in the franchise had been largely overblown pieces of work more interested in set pieces than in its large cast characters (see last year's X- Men: Apocalypse), this is the film that set out to turn that whole notion on its head. For all of its action sequences, this film is first and foremost a character piece as we follow not only Wolverine but Charles Xavier (played once again by Sir Patrick Stewart) in a somewhat dystopian world not too far removed from our own where mutants are on the brink of extinction. The film then is something of a third act for both their characters and the results are fairly dark and bleak with Jackman wonderfully portraying a man who was apparently immortal now coming to terms with his own mortality while also being given something his life has apparently lacked for many years: a purpose. The flashes of humor, well played by both Jackman and Stewart, stop the film from ever going too far into the darkness though and help keep it on a more level playing field. That being said, it is far and away the darkest film the franchise has yet produced.It's also a far more bloody and violent film than one might have expected as well. Though the character has featured in eight previous films where Jackman has played the role (not to mention several animated TV series), none of them showed the level of violence that this film has with liberal amounts of blood flying and no attempt to shy away from gore. Having read the Old Man Logic comic that helped inspire the film, this didn't come as too much of a surprise. What did come as a surprise was that the film set aside the decidedly over the top violence of the comic and instead portrayed as being far more realistic than one might have expected. While it is never gruesome, Logan as a film never shies away from blood and the consequences of violence which definitely separates it from the rest of the franchise without a doubt.Speaking of Old Man Logan, it is perhaps because of that comic that Logan the film bares far more similarities to an entirely different genre of film: the western. It is comparable to something like John Wayne's final film The Shootist which touches on many of the same themes of an old legend coming to terms with his morality and legacy while also passing on the torch to the next generation. The cinematography even evokes the genre in the film's opening and closing acts to a large extent with sweeping vistas of often bleak landscapes. There's also scenes set in a casino, horses, and the modern equivalent of the little guy being squeezed out by the rich cattle baron's men. The film even goes so far as to feature footage from and to pay homage to one of that genre's best known works in the form of the 1953 film Shane. Also, taking a cue perhaps from the aforementioned Old Man Logan, the film is something of a road trip film that gives us a tour of the US in the post-mutant age. The result of these factors coming together is a film that is far different in tone and better made than any of its predecessors. Yet, one left the cinema without the sense of ""Wow"" that a film like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight left me with. Maybe it's the lack of a thoroughly menacing antagonist (though the combination of both Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant is quite effective) or the fact that, if one stops and thinks about it, the action sequences become repetitive after awhile. For a reason or reasons I can't quite put my finger on, Logan didn't leave me with the same sense of having watched a genre being reshaped in front of me that I was left with at the end of Nolan's seminal film (which this film has often been compared to).While it is not perhaps the instant classic that some have made it out to be, there is plenty of reasons to see Logan. It is far and away the best X-Men related film we've had to date and one of the strongest comic book films out there at the moment. There's also its performances and its overall look and tone, something which makes it that rare film that defies expectations. Above all else though, it delivers a worthy last act to Hugh Jackman's long career in the role. For those wishing to see how to give a performer a proper exit from an iconic role, this is a prime example of how to do that right.","

"Logan","hat_city","8 March 2017","This movie takes place in an alternate universe, where somebody (probably Apocalypse) has unleashed a terrible radiation on planet Earth, turning all of its inhabitants into total morons and losers. So, if you're interested in seeing your favorite X-Men heroes totally humiliate themselves and literally act like they are mentally retarded, then go ahead and watch this movie.You will see the incredible X-Men reduced to swearing, bickering, tantrum-throwing teenagers, shopping in an indoor mall, then sitting around in their hotel room and watching crappy reruns on TV. No joke, that all really happens in this movie.As usual, it hurts me very deeply to see my favorite childhood heroes utterly humiliated and destroyed by Hollywood. The underlying message of this movie seems to be that the Age of Heroes is dead. There is no beauty left in the world, no hope, no shining intelligent ideas or dreams. That has all been replaced by shallow, empty scriptwriters and greedy, ruthless movie producers. So watch this movie and say goodbye to your childhood heroes on more time, because (as usual in these terrible X-Men movies) they all die.","

the little girl's psychotic violence is over the top. The only part of the film I even liked was when Logan tore up the car thieves. After that it went downhill fast and hit bottom....then started to dig. Our time will be better spent watching the earlier films.","

I know the genre is different, but every genre has to achieve that high bar in order to be called masterpiece, so anyone who says it is a masterpiece has no idea of how a masterpiece looks like.Many said it is depressing, again I felt it is not at all depressing, it is a very simple script, very linear ,no twists, no mysteries, sometimes funny, just the bad guys chasing a mutant girl who is being protected by Logan. Everything else around are to spice up this very linear moments in the life of decaying wolverine. If you are thinking this is a movie that you will remember after even like a week and miss, then you are wrong. This movie is worth watching one time, just one time. But is it necessary movie that I will say you should watch this before you die kind of movie? Not at all. You can miss out on this one and you will miss nothing important in life. I give it rating of 6 because I have seem better and more deep movies which kept me thing hours after watching the movie rated less than 7. So 6 is a good rating for this movie. Now why is it rated 8 or more? I have no clue how IMDb works who comes and reviews these movies, it got a 8 because I suppose it is Wolverine. Wolverine is a character already developed, new characters in the movie had no emotional influence on me at all including the girl. If I think deeply about that I will rate it less than 6 but I am just gonna be generous and keep my 6 rating.Thank you.","

"Logan","McTavish22","16 June 2017","In movies, screenwriters are like Gods; they can make anything appear on the big screen. Is this how the plot will play out-killing Professor Charles in this particular movie despite the fact that he is elderly and murdering Logan as retaliation for his absence from future Logan movies? Although it is unfair, I can see that the extra blood and profanity they chose to use make many queasy. Nevertheless, how many X-Men character films genuinely need an experimental story to support the plot? Every Wolverine tale either has him being used as a test subject or features other mutants who are unstoppable in their efforts to achieve their objectives.There are a number of ways to end the story while honoring the characters and wishing them well for what they have done for the planet and humanity by overcoming the toughest challenges and making innumerable sacrifices for the greater good. This kind of conclusion, much less amusing millions of admirers, is not anything I appreciate at all. I look forward to a denouement that respectably honors my HEROES as a fan of MARVEL.","

"Logan","DeBBss","8 June 2017","Logan is brilliant, everyone who helped make this movie needs credit, because every little thing about this movie is amazing, well done by the the cast, the directors and the writers.Story: 10/10This movie is about old man Logan, which is about Logan slowly dying because the Adamantium on his bones is poisoning him. While Logan is slowly dying, Professor Xavier meets a little girl, Laura/X-23 who was sent by a doctor who worked at the weapon X program in Mexico, the doctor promised to give Logan money to send Laura to a secret location where all the escaped children from the weapon X program would meet and escape. Surprisingly I didn't find any plot holes, so bravo James Mangold.Characters 10/10Logan: Hugh Jackman did an excellent job, he made Logan look like he was hopeless and broke, and that's what actors are supposed to do to roles like these.Charles Xavier: Patrick Stewart played just as well as Hugh Jackman, he made Charles Xavier look so broken and aged, great job.Laura: Laura is a clone of Logan, she is made up Logan's DNA which means she has the same powers as Logan.Donald Pierce: To be honest Donald Pierce isn't a strong bad guy, he's always hiding behind people and doesn't look that independent, but Boyd Holbrook did have some acting skills.Action 10/10The action in Logan is brutal, it's down to earth bloody and violent, which is exactly why this movie is a 10/10, if this movie didn't have that type of violence it would be an average superhero movie and that's what made Deadpool so great. All of the action in this movie is combat, just Logan and Laura going all out in brutally fashion.This movie is amazing, most movies rely on the action to make the movie a bit more successful, but this movie doesn't need it, the acting and the X-23 story is great, they couldn't have done a better job.","

"Logan","verminhater","16 April 2017","As an avid enjoyer of most superhero movies, with the X men franchise near the top of my films to enjoy list I looked forward to the climax of the set. Unfortunately there is little to enjoy here as Xavier is senile, Logan is a babysitter for Charles and Logan's ""daughter"" says almost nothing.It's hard to like a character that says nothing. There's little to endear them to the viewer and that is the case here. Suffering Alzheimer's is a terrible thing to cope with and not much fun to watch either. It might be a great challenge for an actor but it's not an area of entertainment for me. To then make Logan a drunk on top of two other miserable characters is asking too much for this viewer. With the characters so full of misery there's just no hero any more let alone a super one.Of course Logan becomes the hero at the end but it's too little to late to make this a superhero movie. It's really just a means of removing the characters so Marvel can move on to some other franchise. All in it's easily the worst of the franchise and a poor way to finish an excellent series of films.","

"Logan","unkeeperyt","13 June 2020","This movie, this movie is prefect because of the plot, characters and rating. Marvel has never done a MA15+ movie until now and I think every marvel movie that needs a MA15+ rating should, it's works and done amazing in this movie but not all marvel movies should be MA15+ because doesn't always work but that's a different convo.My old favourite comic book movie was watchmen because of the action scene but here I don't care if the guns are corrected or not because all I care about is seeing Logan go though people one by one like a hot knife though butter. The characters are changed, improved or added in the plot perfectly with not many issues but there's one issues a friend of Logan who has sun issues, he's very annoying but has reasons to be in the plot but is very annoying and I would have prefer if he wasn't there.The plot got to do with a kid who has Logan's powers and Logan needs to take her to Mexico to be safe but on his way there's different things that happens like professional x stopping time or him becoming a talking ad machine another is the kid attacking people for no reason because she doesn't understand the world and many more.To skip a head this is the way to end Logan story with the ending being more sad than half of the movies on the market. The relationship between the kid and Logan comes to the end and works well with the plot. My favourite thing about this movie is that it's semi base on a comic book and doesn't take everything from the book.Inconclusive this movie is a masterpiece and should be a blueprint for marvel in the future and shouldn't have anything below a 8.5.","

"Logan","jamesrupert2014","16 September 2017","'Logan' continues the darkening trend in 'super-hero' movies, and being rated ""R"", was allowed to be gruesome in addition to being grim and dark. The plot is pretty thin: essentially 'Logan' is a 'bonding-during-a-road-trip' movie back-dropped by the X-Men mythos. The storyline allows Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart to showcase their acting abilities (a big step up for both from the 2D comic book characters they played in other entries in the franchise). There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies, but that's nothing new for the genre and, all in all, the story is interesting and (spoilers hinted at) its position in the overall X-man/Wolverine story-arc allows outcomes not possible in earlier chapters. Probably as close to that oxymoron ""an adult-superhero movie"" as I've seen (other than the much superior ""The Dark Knight""). A bit slow at times but generally watchable: not as great as some reviewers gush but a lot better than many of the entries in the Marvel (or DC) film-verse","

This movie takes us into the future where Logan is more tired, sore and bitter. He drinks and winces from the pain. Then - the plot thickens - the bad guys come. Then Wolverine is asked to help someone and as always he says no and then he helps. Now guess what happens! Yup, bad guys come. Big fight, good guys get away and bad guys keep looking. Good guys meet innocent family and stay for dinner. But of course, the nice people are having difficulties with someone and Logan sends them a running. Classic Shane story line in all but 5 minutes. OK - now guess what happens. Yup - bad guys come. Big fight, people die and good guys get away. Then what happens? Yup - bad guys find good guys and we have a final big fight. And yes - good guys win - well sort off - in that all the bad guys are dead. How the heck did this film get 5/5 and 4/5 stars from my favourite critics. What movie where they watching?

"Logan","aka_sabretooth","12 March 2017","This is the perfect movie treat for fans of the Wolverine character as portrayed by Hugh Jackman in films. Period. I won't argue with that. And you can tell as much by just checking the titles of the ""Five Stars!"" reviews here at IMDb. Yep, it's exactly what this movie is. And by the way I am not a ""fan"" of the Wolverine comic books, I happen to like a few of them from the 80s. So I don't go to the cinema expecting to see a comic book I already have in my shelves. So what did I find in this film? A boring, unoriginal and unimaginative movie, willing to satisfy the appetites of fans left open in prior attempts of the franchise, full of moronic routines I won't bother to list. The occasional comedy moments are jokes based around the walking disability of a character, so expect the laughs to border the derogatory. And the choreographed ""over the top"" slashing violence quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Plus... there is also a lot of violence dispensed to kids, and by kids. Kids are shot, stabbed and kicked -a lot. And in turn the same kids stab back, slash back, electrify and decapitate. Which is creepy if you ask me, as for this alone the film merits to be a horror movie -which it ain't. Last, lots of people are saying the story is based in a comic book series titled OLD MAN LOGAN. OK, please don't. Because in this film (do I need to say... SPOILERS AHEAD?) Wolverine, now Logan, works as a limo driver to make money and buy anti seizure medication for Prof. X and hopes to make enough dough to buy a boat and go live in the middle of the ocean with same Prof. X. Do you find any resemblance in that with the comic book series? I guess not. The only thing in common with OLD MAN LOGAN is that Logan is OLD. End of similarities. Yeah, just skip it I guess.","

"Logan","HorrorBrainShane","20 September 2017","This movie is a Western. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost- I love westerns. I do not like westerns that remove the tropes, allegory, and character arcs from the setting of the old west and transpose it somewhere else. Perhaps that is just my opinion, but the setting is intrinsic to a large part of the narratives that westerns often use.Director James Mangold clearly loves films like The Searchers, True Grit, A Fistful of Dollars, and Shane- Logan is rife with references. It telegraphs the plot, uses very obvious foreshadowing, and paints its obvious plot out for you. You know what's going to happen, in spite of how much you don't want it to. And I really didn't want it to.This film has zero fun factor whatsoever. It's a hideously depressing film, one that doesn't celebrate the history of the character of Wolverine or use him in the comic-book context with which we are so accustomed. Instead, this hyper-realistic version of the universe has just about everything that could turn off someone looking to have fun. Perhaps brutal nihilism in the face of your own growing mortality is one person's idea of a good superhero movie. Not for me. This is Wolverine, not Neil Gaiman or Jhonen Vasquez creations. Perhaps this is why the film got such a great reception: it is not a prototypical superhero film. But it isn't a very ambitious film, either, just a film that plays with genre expectations in one specific way in order to completely copy elements of older films. Even the cinematography is lengthy, uninspired, and wholly traditional. Even the plot follows a rinse-repeat formula reminiscent of the Man with No Name films. The saving grace of the film stems from its obvious influences, because if you copy enough good movies you'll eventually make some good narrative choices. The plot isn't bad, it's derivative. The movie isn't poorly made, it's poorly conceived.I simply ask one thing of superhero and comic book films: Even if it is dark or r-rated, it still has to be entertaining. Logan is not. It;'s anti-fun, sucking energy from every person who views it. Logan has some fantastic performances and calls back to a lot of great old Westerns, but it's not a good superhero movie because it made me uncomfortably depressed, bored, and begrudgingly disappointed at how traditional, derivative, and copycat the movie is, and how much it utterly failed at being fun.","

"Logan","thesar-2","17 April 2017","The moment everyone craved as arrived! No longer is there a wait for  the most simultaneously realistic, R-rated and miserable superhero film  of all time: Logan.  Seriously, they wanted a serious Wolverine movie. We got it. Just, as  always, be careful what you wish for.  It's hard to rate this movie low because of the production values,  acting and no-holds-barred R-rating. But, on the flipside, it's hard to  recommend this movie because it's so off-the-beaten-superhero path,  it's set 12 years into the future with about .0005% future proof and  worst of all: it's incredibly depressing.  Sadly, someone online spoiled two main points in  this movie, so I knew what to expect. What I didn't see coming, though,  was how sad this movie was. If you love superhero movies, hope and fun  X-Men unity, look elsewhere. This movie is the equivalent of sitting in  the hospice waiting room with your loved one a couple of doors down the  halland just patiently waiting.  BUT, I suppose everyone demanded it. Everyone wanted the Hard-R  Wolverine movie. So here it is. In all its surprising simplicity.  The supposedly invincible and ageless ""Old-Man"" Logan is feeling he's  finally on his way out, but he reluctantly agrees to one more mission:  take a girl to the Promised Land. Along the way, the two people he  cares the most about are just as hunted as he is.  While I cannot deny this was a well-made film, I doubt I will be  watching this again. I usually don't wish for reboots of series, but I  do now. Here. This was a perfect final X-Men filmof the Fox Age. Give  it up, Fox!  Also, I'm not all about Disney having supreme rule over the Earthor at  least, Earth's (Real) Mightiest Heroesbut, now, hand this franchise  over to capable hands. Reboot it. Call it, The Uncanny X-Men. I don't  care. But, see this as a true end to that long string of foX-Men films.  And remember what it's like to have fun with superhero films. Heck,  even Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, combined,  wasn't 10% as bleak as this.  ***  Final thoughts: Admittedly, I fell asleep twice in this movie. I'm not  going to go as far as to say this movie is boring, but yeah, sometimes  it drags, is too heavy, dark, melancholy and was way too long for such  a simple plot. So, being boringisn't the only flaw.","

"Logan","justin-fencsak","15 March 2017","It all began when Hugh Jackman starred in his first major American movie as Wolverine in the 2000 hit X-Men, and it ends with his final movie, Logan. Taking place in 2029 when the whole world is changing, this epic movie features Hugh Jackman as Logan as he tries to take care of an ailing Professor X, played with gusto performance by Patrick Stewart. Along the way (spoiler alert), he meets his long lost daughter, Laura (played by Dafne Keen in her first major movie debut), who shares the same traits as her father but speaks little English. In the end, Professor X dies, then Logan by a clone, leaving behind Laura putting a cross vertically like an X to honor his legacy. Some scenes in this movie might be upsetting for people since it's an R rated movie. There is lots of violence, blood, and some seizure inducing scenes yet there's no sex. Some scenes the movie drags along yet it makes up for it with excellent action scenes. I consider Logan to be the best X-Men movie ever and quite possibly the best super hero movie of the year, even though there are more coming out later.","

It's one of the best sci-fi/action/comics, I've seen in a very long while. I've said more than once that the X Men have the best characters written down in comics history. They also have some of the best story lines, even though this one is not part of their long illustrious mythology, it's still rings true to their comic based characters, and since the comics itself had already presented us with so many alternate realities, none can complain if it doesn't follow a precise story from the comic books.Hugh Jackman, presents what I consider to be his best movie performance, Patrick Stewart is coming close to his very best, (I simply didn't see enough of his movies to pass a definite judgment). Dafne Keen shows great promise, as the young wild, and sensitive X23. The rest of the cast are faultless to the very last minute role. And the story flows naturally from the very start, it's as if it simply writes itself, and as far as I'm concerned it's one of the best complements one can give a story or a script. A real masterpiece and a great signoff for a wonderful character. All fans of the X Men, and of Wolverin especially, this one is a real must see.","

"Logan","WorldMovie99","5 September 2023","Logan is an epic from the very beginning to climax. Totally cut off from unrealistic realm trying to be more realistic. It did well and is praiseworthy. A classic in the X-Men franchise. To be precise the best !Hugh Jackman is perfect as the old hero who once saved the world. An old guy who became fragile in strength and the director is cautious enough to show that he could fight only with humans not with mutants anymore. Logan is now peaceful becoming peace oriented with friends but the Laura's entry was shocking for him that keeps the film going. Logan was happy with Charles with few dreams of his own trying to stay away from the people and be at peace. The performance regarding this is satisfying at every level. But the ultimate challenge appears before him and he has to deal with both humane and inhumane spirit within himself. Laura is the point of turning table upside. That makes the film gripping. Logan fragileness makes himself humanely protective but falls short of his previously violent characteristics. This makes clear the ending that he is defeated in the end. Logan still saves the world this time but he leaves the world for better and finds someone to replace himself. Perhaps the only thing needed in the end was right motivation. And Logan did it by hook or crook.Logan is less about Superhuman but more about human life, relationships, sacrifice. The action and thrilling sequences are a kind of cherry on the pudding. It will entertain you but amidst it connects you with the reality of lives and society. It is a recommended film for some exquisite taste even for matured viewers, whose storyline will make you remember the film as an unique event. Though it ends with an pessimistic note where the lead character is lost forever, but carries an optimistic theme where it teaches us the value of life, family, sacrifice. An epic in its genre, it's a 98/100.","

Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres.Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be.This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character.

"Logan","Giacomo_De_Bello","3 March 2017","Sad, brutal, powerful and most importantly freshly original, ""Logan"" is a great piece of cinema with performers committed to this material in a way we haven't quite seen before in the genre which pays off by touching emotional heights for which the audience might be as unprepared as much as they are touched by it.The balancing act that Mangold pulls off is a tricky one, but his mastery in molding the tones and hitting the emotional moments when they need to is remarkable, he takes full advantage on his medium and leaves us with frames and feelings stuck in our head for long after the film's departure. He has so much on his table to bring to life, there are multiple story lines and many moving pieces, but he makes all of it into a beautifully flowing piece where you never feel lost, everything here belongs to this film.The success of this emotional piece is strictly connected to how good the performances in it are. First off is Boyd Holdbrook who is a revelation, he has a natural talent for holding the screen and being magnetic and make the most out of it giving us a villainous role that is the perfect match for this feature. On top of that comes Dafne Keen who does stuff which I have never seen in a movie theater before, she is crazy good and possibly one of the best child performances I have ever seen. What she conveys with her eyes only is incredible and when she starts getting into the action they do stuff that I have honestly never seen before with a child.Of course this is the Jackman/Stewart show in the end and what a show, what a finale to give to these characters. There isn't merit to be awarded singularly here, as in all great movies, the quality of the emotions you are being carried through starts with a truly great script that offers the actors A+ level material to work with. They rise to the challenge, making the most out of every word, every stare and in comes Mangold and his delicate touch in capturing all of these moments. This film is really sad, it brings to life emotions and characters in a way that hits the audience deeply, the themes of bitterness, rejection, heartbreak, love, life, purpose, discrimination, hope, it brings tears to my eyes just recalling the outlook the films takes and it is a icon of how cinema can convey theme through story no matter its nature.The struggles the characters go through in this film feel so raw and close to us. Professor Xavier is given what is possibly his best portrayal and arch yet, he his in a sad, sad place, his life feels so tragic to us, his dreams have vanished, the way Stewart portrays him takes us to a place of such humanity, looking at an old man, a great man who is at the end of line, disillusioned and lost, mad, but still hoping. It is a beautiful piece of character drama that is developed throughout the film with pitch perfect dramatization and, curiously enough, the perfect amount out comic relief. As much as this film is emotional and sad it has moments of comedy gold that fit in seamlessly as they have always been part of these characters. Stewart has moments of ""Cukoo's Nest"" madness that bring out really funny monologues, plus his timing on one liners is perfect and even the way he moves makes for great comedy. And of course we don't loose Wolverine's dry humor which has always been a great part of his character.And we haven't touch upon the action yet. This movie is violent and brutal and awesome because of that. Every drop of blood, every hit, every scar is justified by story. there isn't a moment of wasted time in the action, it feels urgent and necessary, the set-pieces flow in naturally and frenetically, they enter the story at the right times, they build and end when they need to and when it is time to start a new one is always feels built up and climaxes to new heights which are topped with the final confrontation which is a blood bath of violence and savageness that has me white knuckled, you almost feel there, with the characters, in the middle of this insane struggle. You feel every it, the pain in every cut has a weight and Logan's incredible effort and stress to go on it conveyed brutally in a way that you almost feel it upon yourself.I think that there are only a few criticism that I could move towards the film which are plot points that are repeated throughout which don't really belong in the film. They insist on an X-Men comic point which has nothing to do with the film and raises questions all around which don't really need to be there and could have easily been solved with another macguffin. These sort of nitpicks and continuity issues are the only ones that really have any place in being pointed out.Everything else in ""Logan"" works, this is a devastating film, with many tears involved, it will stick with you and leave you with images and feelings stuck in you mind, that is the mark of great, great film, one that molds tones and stories into one beautiful piece of genre cinema that will certainly have a lasting effect through its legacy, every single risk taken in here paid off to perfection.","

"Logan","Movie_Muse_Reviews","22 March 2017","Hugh Jackman's 17-year ride as beloved ""X-Men"" hero Wolverine has been full of ups (""X2"") and downs (""X-Men Origins""), but his commitment to the character has never wavered, and that's undoubtedly a factor in what makes ""Logan"" a special superhero film.Inspired by Mark Millar's ""Old Man Logan"" storyline, the film takes place in 2029 in a world almost completely devoid of mutants. A physically ailing Wolverine has concealed his identity and works as a private driver in El Paso. He commutes over the border to Mexico, where he's hiding a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has seizures that result in physical tremors. Their quiet life is upended when a woman pursues Logan with a request to take care of a young girl in her care named Laura (Dafne Keen). But some bad folks from a bad technology company are after Laura, who shows some mutant-like tendencies that resemble Wolverine's. The three are forced on the run with the hope of getting Laura to a safe haven in North Dakota.The film both subtly and overtly resembles a Western. Director James Mangold, who also made 2013's underrated ""The Wolverine,"" also directed the strong ""3:10 to Yuma"" remake and the acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line."" Story and aesthetic elements of both make it into this film, as does the character-focused storytelling that made ""The Wolverine"" a strong entry in the character's lengthy canon.It may seem crude, but what elevates ""Logan"" to the top of the Wolverine spin-off pile has a lot to do with its R rating. Although the violence adds a grit that better captures the essence of the character, it's equally about the maturity of the storytelling. The R rating also affects the style of the film, which is far more dramatic and introspective, and consequently much slower in pace. Freeing Wolverine from the restraints of PG-13 also means freeing him from the restraints of the cookie-cutter comic book blockbuster framework. Mangold and fellow scripters Scott Frank and Michael Green are able to populate the story with character-building scenes and dialogue that serves more than plot momentum.The success of Fox's ""Deadpool"" would seem the obvious source of our gratitude for Logan's liberation, but Mangold's vision and Jackman's tenure in the role, which has raked in billions for the studio in the last two decades, had to inspire more confidence that if any character could carve its way out of the superhero mold, it would be this one. Mangold and Jackman reward the studio's trust – and our trust – with a one-of-a-kind riff on the genre, something becoming increasingly vital after two decades of Juggernaut-like forward momentum in Hollywood comic book adaptations.Yet for the ways it tests the limits of the genre, ""Logan"" doesn't transcend it. It still ultimately feels like a comic book movie, namely in the way it gives in to action set pieces and gratuitous violence (albeit in a whole other stratosphere, stylistically speaking). Adding Western tropes to superhero tropes technically doubles the amount of tropes, and both genres have an overwhelming tendency to descend into violence. So ""Logan"" may not be formulaic, but it's still predictable. The script finds some nice moments that exist in service to themes and emotions, but the storytelling is simply good, not exceptional. Watching a superhero film play out in such a unique manner is more satisfying than following the actual story itself.Nevertheless, Jackman seizes his opportunity to go out on a much more profound note than fans of the character ever dreamed possible, especially in 2009 after ""X-Men Origins."" The story, the style – these components give an actor who was already such an effortless fit more opportunities to own the character, which is bittersweet given he's hanging up the claws. All the same things can be said of Stewart, who did it without ever having a solo film. He actually has the more demanding role given how different it is than his previous appearances as Professor X.""Logan"" is refreshing and interesting, which means it might not hold up over time as superhero films continue testing the limits that once contained them, but it will undoubtedly stand out as one of the high points of Jackman's unprecedented legacy as Wolverine.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Logan","johncorcione","21 June 2017","I was pleasantly Surprised on this movie. What held it for me is that you didn't need all the other marvel comic characters in the film. Story Arc was well produced and adapted to the big screen. As another reviewer mentioned I also wished there would have been more fight sequences between Logan and X-23. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.","

"Logan","chandean-69762","26 January 2021","The decision to make this rated R was such a perfect choice for both the tone and the story of this film. It's dark, gruesome, somber, and definitely gory. Hugh Jackman has his best act yet as he departs away from Wolverine (at least for now) carrying a huge, dark and heartbreaking performance.
Storytelling is also huge in this, definitely the darkest X-Men film thus far with huge stakes as our beaten down Wolverine and elderly Prof. X try to help Laura - a young mutant. The only thing that can be said negatively about this film is the pacing, the second act of this film is mostly traveling and learning about Laura and her past. But the first and final act all ride really fast and are thrilling to watch. Even with how dark this film is, theres some pretty solid humor in both the first and second act before taking an even darker tone in the final act.
And the action, oh man what do I even say. It's so brutal and gruesome its honestly just what we all wanted from a Wolverine film. Dafne Keen even has some crazy awesome action scenes. I hope we get to see more of her in this role.","

"Logan","shobanchittuprolu","1 August 2017","Logan (2017): Superpowers are one thing, but no-one said they were immortal. What happens when superheroes get old? Actually, what happens when, like many non-superheroes, they arrive at late middle-age without a partner, in ill health, and with an ageing parent to look after? I have hear rave reviews about Logan and many of them claimed that it is the most emotional superhero movie of all time.Except for Hugh Jackman's terrific portrayal,I never cared about Wolverine but Logan proved me wrong.Even not being a fan,Logan made me teary-eyed at the end ans Yes.. Logan is one of the most emotional superhero movie of all time.Plot: In 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan.My Review: Logan is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film.Who would even dare tho think to make superheroes to fight for their survival?Logan did.Logan is an emphatically cheerless film about the cost of life, and the burden of being a superhero in a world that doesn't deserve them.Part of the reason why Logan manages to be so emotionally effective is because it arrives late in the process for Jackman. The actor has been wearing the claws and percing the flseh out of everyone for 17 years, and he lets those miles show in every haggard look on display in Logan. Jackman full comprehends exactly what Wolverine needs to convey in each Logan scene -- whether its concern or compassion, remorse or berserker rage -- because he has occupied this character's skin for so long. It's second nature, and the decisions he makes along every painstaking step of Logan help ensure the movie's masterful success.The second reason is the chemistry between Logan,Professor X and new entry, Laura.Our tired Logan taking care of ill-Xavier and the relation between them is heartwarming and funny at times too. Laura,who is almost mute for almost 3/4th of the film except for the screaming whenever she fights.All 3 of them has good chemistry between them which made us cry at the sad parts.Logan doesn't follow the superhero blueprint, though that's a check in its favor. There are villains, yes, but the real antagonist staring down Wolverine is time, and fate. Cities aren't blown up and no visual destruction is shown in this movie.It has everything common which is uncommon for superhero film.I was deeply moved by Jackman's soulful, intense and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance, which draws from every appearance as the Wolverine.Jackman wears pain, persecution and baggage in his eyes, and in his sighs. We see him wanting to stamp out hope but unable to go through with it, the actor carving up his character with both weariness and restlessness at once. It is a strong, resonant performance, an appropriately powerful.By his side is the great Patrick Stewart, who gives the most emotionally affecting performance of the entire X-Men franchise as a decrepit, mentally weakened Professor Charles Xavier.Dafne Keen is an absolute showstopper of a child who has all of Logan's powers and more, and none of the restraint its taken him lifetimes to accumulate. and the way this young child relishes the violence -- slicing villains to shreds with wildcat rage and ice-cream-truck glee -- may be this film's most disturbing image.So,Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.My rating 8.25/10","

"Logan","drfcx","12 December 2020","I decided December would be X-Men month. Watching the films in chronological order so I understood the storyline. In comparison to the avengers storyline, X-Men barely seemed worth making, the concept is solid, but the end product lacked in almost all accounts, 2d characters, bad villains, poor pacing,And bad writing. I would have probably placed the X-Men franchise around 4.5/10.
Then I watched Logan. Had every other x-men film been created to the same standard as Logan (exceptions being the Deadpool series), avengers would have a serious contender.
From the outset the grittier violence level, darker tones and lack of silly outfits sets this apart immediately. Picking out a small cast of remaining mutants only helps as it finally gives the audience time to develop a relationship with the X-Men, understand their flaws, and garnish them with a sense of humour, something the franchise has been lacking dearly in its overwhelming pursuit of seriousness.
Stripping back the X-Men, and removing much of the technology, vast casts, and grandeur did Logan a world of good. The improved writing really allowed Hugh Jackman to shine, well beyond what I thought he was capable of, and despite sharing the screen with Patrick Stewart, he really held his own, as did Dafne Keen.
Keen really did shine bright here, despite. Being mute for most the film she still managed to feed us with enough character.
This is a brilliant film, I can understand where my fellow reviewers are coming from but I think many of them are wrong to be overly critical. This was an outstanding addition to the franchise. Void of all the previous X-Men failings. It should have always been gritty and well thought from the very beginning.8/10","

"Logan","mstomaso","3 March 2018","With strong support from Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen, Hugh Jackman successfully pulls off a sensitive portrayal of a declining hero and his somewhat self-imposed alienation, decorated with the usual Marvel studios CGI action sequences. While the CGI sequences were as protracted as they usually are in contemporary pop culture movies, they did not detract from the film's strong emotional content and were more integrated into every level of the story than they are in most comic book adaptations. The Wolverine, Logan, (Jackman) may reach an heretofore unrealized peace with himself and his world through his newfound relationship with a young girl who may be his daughter Laura (Keen). However, Laura is being hunted by the same evil that has hunted Logan throughout most of his life, and his Logan's other real connection to humanity, Charles Xavier (Stewart), needs more help than he can give. The most dangerous mind in the world (Xavier) teamed up with one of the most dangerous men in the world (Logan) might seem like an undefeatable juggernaut, but for many reasons, neither of these superhero legends are what they used to be. As the story unfolds, Logan's powerful defense mechanisms are challenged in ways that have, in previous adventures, been his undoing; aspects of Laura's personality and history leave the value of the central adventure wide-open to question; and Xavier's loss of the ability to control his incredible mental powers threaten to expose everything. It really is not clear what will happen in this film until it actually does. Thoroughly entertaining, well-acted, well-paced and surprisingly touching, Logan is one of the best films I have seen from this genre.","

Otherwise this is a movie where Logan and Xavier's behavior is stupid nasty and completely inconsistent with their characters in earlier movies. The excessive violence seems to be impregnated with a vicious pleasure which is deeply nasty. The makers of this film should be ashamed of themselves. I hope Sir Patrick, Mr. Jackman and Miss Keen find better use for their many talents in the future.","

"Logan","taucoin-191-743157","13 September 2020","I saw this in theater, but after watching it again for the tenth time, I felt compelled to write a review for this phenomenal film. Logan is proof that the superhero genre is not stagnant and can work on so many levels. Prime's The Boys (2019) and the Deadpool films where further proof of that.Logan pulls no punches with it's hard R rating. The level of violence is staggering, yet not gratuitous. These characters live in a bleak and harsh world that barely gives you time to breath. James Mangold steps his (and the genres) game up after the mediocre The Wolverine (2013) with such a superbly crafted film, that I personally expect nothing less from him for the rest of his already very impressive career.Dafne Keen's breakthrough performance is comparible to Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994). Everything about this film is perfectly executed and it's one of the greatest superhero films ever made.","

"Logan","Daedsikcaj","19 September 2017","I'm not going to waste a whole lot of time breaking down the movie Logan. There are over one thousand user reviews on IMDb and by now interest in this movie has waned, plenty of people have already critiqued it in detail and added to that, few people will stumble upon the page of reviews that mine ends up on. And as wordy as I am, I'm ironically just posting this review to save people time that could be better spent elsewhere. So here goes... my fast reviewSKIP TO HERE-Have you seen Children of Men? If you have, you've already seen this movie. Logan is Children of Men's future for mutants. If you haven't, watch Children of Men instead. It's not the best, but it's better than Logan (as always, Michael Caine > Patrick Stewart)-Do you know what Oscar Bait is? If you do, take my word for it. This is the best way to describe Logan (although the idea that anyone involved in Logan could be so delusional as to think that this movie would receive consideration would actually be legitimately depressing as opposed to the shallow feeling of dreariness it tries to create. If that was the goal all along then it is genius. Bravo! But honestly... nothing against the cast, but there are no Oscar worthy performances here. There is no best written screenplay here. And as for the biggest awards, did anyone really think this would be the Sci-Fi movie that pulled it off?)If you do not know what Oscar Bait is, google it and read the wiki definition or even better read the one from TV Tropes (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait). Oscar Bait movies are the kind of movies that think being sad and depressing equals art. They try to appeal to the crowd that avoids films that are well liked in general. For them, a happy ending is cheesy, it's for the masses, it's less creative. Sad endings, they believe, are brave and smart and edgy and above all, more deserving of the word ""art."" In reality, this is of course complete garbage. A well written good ending takes just as much effort to create as a bad one.Logan attempted to go ""artsy"" and ""dark"" and it felt shallow and clichéd. For me, the whole story was a very lazy way to explain why Hugh Jackman looks too old now and why Logan the character is no longer regenerating. It isn't original or ground breaking; it ripped off a movie that isn't even old, as if everyone would have forgotten that Children of Men existed, which I'm sure if I did some reading, would turn out to be not entirely original itself. I'm not about to say that films with sad endings are always like this. Some of my favorite films of all time have sad endings. Cuckoo's Nest, Aviator, Midnight Cowboy (though a little uplifting too), sometimes artists have a story to tell and those stories don't always end well for everyone involved. (side note, does anyone else but me think that Coming to America has the happiest ending of all time? Even Daryl finds happiness in the end, everyone wins! anyways..) So don't think that I'm biased against films that do go dark, I just want for them to be done well and with honesty. So what if comic books are what we read as kids in order to escape how awful reality really is and how rarely the good guy wins. So what if super-heroes exist because of how appealing the fantasies they create are and satisfying it is to envision a world where justice always prevails and nothing bad ever happens to good and innocent people. If you want to go dark and depressing do it! Just don't be lazy about it, put a little effort into it. Be sad if you want to just have an engaging and original story to tell. Maybe they should have done to Wolverine what the franchise did to Cyclops. If you can't come up with something clever just kill him off-screen instead. I'm trying to figure out which death is more disrespectful to the source material and fans of the character. I'm also trying to figure out why the X-Men get so many chances after failing more times than not, while my Punisher gets screwed up one time and then gets banished to the small screen. ...Well I guess my review ended up a little longer than I originally intended. Sorry I'm so wordy, I just don't get out much and when I do I'm usually pretty quiet so when I get the chance to speak or communicate I end up abusing it and I never know when to..... .. I'll attempt to make up for it, I'll make that fast (rant free) review now.... here goes....SKIP TO HERE INSTEADLogan is Oscar Bait. It is lazy unoriginal garbage that takes itself way too seriously.","

"Logan","Flamingwoks","8 March 2017","I'm frankly astonished by all the positive reviews, especially those comparing this to ""The Dark knight"". The films tone leans towards edgy rather than dark in my opinion with profuse use of unnecessary cursing making it feel like an 18 year old was hired to spice up the dull plodding nature of each scene. Moments felt like the Coen brothers ""No country for old men"" was lifted whole sale and stitched onto the plot of ""Children of men"" with a smattering of ""Xmen 2"". Not necessarily the worst idea ever, but the execution just leads to a painful and cringe worthy experience. Many moments I found my hands raised in disbelief as mutants forgot they had powers. Antagonists failed to use even a percent of their brain when attacking their non Wolverine targets (""YOU HAVE GUNS SHOOT THEM"" was a message I found on my lips at multiple points in the film). Some scenes were so drawn out if the film hadn't been two and a half hours long I'd think they were playing for time (see: Logan exiting a car, sighting a mountain, seeing a girl, falling over, being winched up a cliff, 15 minutes of information being conveyed extraordinarily slowly (that we already knew and had been told before) the full scene took 20 minutes to end with nothing new being learnt, nothing interesting happening and the plot exactly were it left off). Bad acting is present throughout with the exception of Patrick Stewart and Eriq La Salle. Please do not let Dafne Keen star in any more films until she has been taught finesse and timing. Pacing, CGI (the fence scene is especially noticeable), script and attempts at political finger pointing all hinder this film greatly. The films greatest crime though, the ending. Someone explain to me what a territorial border has to offer against PMC with seemingly limitless funds?","

"Logan","BloodOfTheEnemy","14 March 2017","As others have said, the performances by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are very strong and the film evokes a powerful dark mood. If it were therefore not the sequel to many previous more upbeat movies, this movie would have worked very well as a standalone drama.Because it is part of long-running franchise, however, it comes across as painfully incongruous with previous X-Men movies. At the outset of the movie, we see that Logan has descended once again into misery, so all of the gains made in ""The Wolverine"" are lost. Once again also, mutants are on the edge of extinction, so all gains made in ""Days Of Future Past"" are lost (and less than 10 years later, to add to the bewilderment). Basically, it looks like some writer liked the idea of rebooting the mutant doomsday concept of DOFP and taking it in a bleaker direction.I'm sorry, but while excellent acting is something I like in a movie, a good story is at least as important, and to make a good story, you can't render previous entries in the franchise completely pointless. The fact that this happens in the final Wolverine outing, with no opportunity to recover is, of course, all the more heartbreaking. I was surprised when DOFP managed a decent recovery from the mistakes made by X-Men:Last Stand, but not as surprised as I was to see those same mistakes repeated here!","

"Logan","tomgillespie2002","25 May 2017","For the past 17 years, Hugh Jackman has played X-Man Wolverine nine times. It was the role that made him a star, and he's thanked Fox for having faith in him by sticking by the character regardless of how bad the franchise became. But at the age of 49, Jackman has decided to hang up his claws and trim the sideburns, taking a pay- cut in order to give the character the final send-off he truly deserves. He and director James Mangold, who joined forces to make stand-alone entry The Wolverine in 2013 only to see the studio step in and butcher the final edit, have persuaded Fox to go with an R rating. Whether this is down to the huge success of the wonderfully foul-mouthed Deadpool in 2016 or Fox feeling they owe the actor for his loyalty down the years, the results are pretty astonishing. With Logan, the camera no longer cuts away when Wolverine slices and dices, but captures his animalistic ferocity in all its bloody, decapitating glory.Logan is a brutal, angry movie, and more than warrants its 'hard' R rating. It's no gimmick, nor is it a cash-in on Deadpool's success. Superhero movies don't need to follow the Marvel formula of good, clean, family-friendly fun, nor DC's preference for muted colours and CGI-overkill, world-threatening set-pieces. In fact, Logan doesn't feel much like a superhero movie at all. Here, the former cage-fighting, time-travelling X-Man (although it isn't entirely clear where the story fits into Fox's ever-confusing timeline) is an old man, dying of some mysterious illness and battling alcoholism and depression. He is bearded, grey, and wrinkling, and his torso covered in grisly scars from some unspoken former battles. When he uses his claws, his knuckles seep with puss. We're in 2029, and all but three mutants are dead. We don't know why, but Logan is intent on living out his remaining days looking after a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with clairvoyant mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), working as an Uber limo driver to fund the medicine required to keep Charles' dangerous telepathic seizures in check.People start to look for Logan. Gabriela Lopez (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse working for corporation Alkali-Transigen, wants him to transport both her and an eleven year girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden'. Logan is also questioned by Transigen's chief of security Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a cybernetically-enhanced thug who seems to be searching for the little girl. When Gabriela turns up dead and Laura ends up in his care, Logan is forced to take Charles on a road trip to escape Pierce and his Reavers, and to seek out the mysterious Eden. Caliban is abducted by Transigen head Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who forces the albino to use his powers to track down the fleeing mutants and take back Laura. It is revealed that the young girl is one of many mutants experimented on by Rice in the hope of turning them into weapons, and that she possesses the same adamantium claws as Logan.For a character who has seen and done pretty much everything over the past 17 years, it feels a fitting time to draw the curtains. Knowing that another run-of-the-mill superhero adventure wouldn't do the mutant justice, Mangold has done what no other studio movie has done before and portrays the superhero at the ends of his days, trying to bury the past while haunted by his deeds. While Logan does throw in a couple of exciting - and utterly brutal - set-pieces, this is an incredibly sombre experience. It's about getting old, loneliness, and rediscovering a reason to live. Jackman has never been better, and Keen is a real find. Their shared scenes are touching and often hilarious, and with the presence of the ever- reliable Stewart, the trio form an amusingly dysfunctional family unit. While there is an issue with a bland villain who brings back memories of that horrific climax in X- Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), this is a damn near-perfect last hurrah for a character who comic book fans have been hoping would fully unleash his berserker rage for years. Farewell then, Logan aka Wolverine, until the inevitable reboot.","

"Logan","aharmas","4 March 2017","""Logan"" is that very rare movie which is a taut and solid drama, with a superb turn by the marvelous Jackman, giving it his all, showing a range not seen since Heath's Joker interpretation. It's almost like being the other side of the coin, a good man, tortured by guilt, tired of his dark odyssey, a champion who is not allowed to quit, even though his pain has levels which are not unbearable both physically and mentally. ""Logan"" wishes this all ends soon, and the audience will not be disappointed, but they will be both sad and happy that the film presents a very realistic and appropriate ending.On the other hand, ""Logan"" is still a super hero movies, but with a huge heart and much intelligence and respect for the source. Having the powers not become the center of the film, but the family drama makes the film more powerful. There are strong bonds here, with Xavier doing his best to control Logan's tortured nature and his shock at the discovery of the new relationships he is now facing. Jackman's eyes are extraordinary, providing us access into his private hell. He's in agony for most of the story, and he uses his body expertly to convey just how difficult it is to even move around. If you consider, that the adversaries are now some of the strongest he has ever encounter, the outcome doesn't look very good.If Jackman wasn't so good this time, a lot of the credit would to the newcomers, especially the girl who plays another version of a very familiar mutant, as moody and overwhelmed with much emotional turmoil. What is very impressive in that performance is the conviction demonstrated by young girls over the last year. Just like the performers in ""Strange Things"", the young ones here are complex and far reaching. There's hardly a happy moment here, with bodies scattered all over the country as Logan tries to reach safe heaven.""Logan"" is a over two hours, but one knows its conclusion is not the end of the story. A big chapter ends, and we want to know what is next because as the baton is passed, we now the quality will continue, and under the careful production, direction, writing, and editing of team headed by Mangold, we should more than pleased with the results and wish there is more coming, as dark and as painful, but with a little hope.Enjoy!","

"Logan","KeremUlucay","12 July 2019","Logan is an amazing journey and final film, I think it is a great final for both Wolverine and X-Men franchises. Unlike any other superhero movie, it has an attractive way at storytelling and cinematography. And it is one of the most realistic films in this genre. Its atmosphere and tone are just great for character. James Mangold has improved himself since The Wolverine(2013). He really understands the character and tells us how tired Logan is, how he cares about Charles and his indifference for other people. You can feel what Logan and Xavier have been through during years, movie successfully describes those and mutants situations in this universe, that's why storytelling is so well. Also it is enjoyable to see them in this situation, I mean when they at the end of the line. It has an epic and emotional final. Actually, I think it would be more effective on me if I wouldn't wait so long to watch it and learn he dies in that movie. Even though, I surprised so much when X-23 and X-24 showed up. On the other hand, movie have lovely details like X-Men's comics and action figures. Seeing Logan's reaction to those and seeing how people love Wolverine is nice. Finally, I want to thank Hugh Jackman for showing us his best on that iconic character for 17 years. He will never be forgotten as Wolverine.","

There are far better actors out there and personally I think his role should have been played by a female.Secondly, there is one item referred too throughout the film (almost too many times for my liking) making it obvious how it will be used, especially when Hugh Jackman is recovering, but that said by the time it does happen your that engrossed and care so much for the characters it still works.Don't go expecting Spandex and happy heroes but I guarantee you won't be disappointed.","

Finally a mainstream superhero movie for those who don't really care about superheroes, or have grown tired of all the clichés of the genre.It's got R-rated action, it's got characters with some depth and also memorable acting, it's got heart. It still is not deep enough to be compared to the quality superhero TV series, of which there are many. And it loses some of its dramatic heft near the end due to lack of variety (not enough different stuff happening, the same type of events are always recurring).

The mutant population has largely been obliterated and there aren't any new mutants being born. Logan is being employed as a limo-driver, he runs random people here and there for work. His plan is to eventually save up for a boat so he can take his mentor/friend Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and isolate them from the world. We know Xavier has telepathic powers but they're starting to decay and with his mindset deteriorating, he's become a danger to not only himself but to society. Logan is looking a little worse for ware, he has to violently deal with a couple of thieves and he doesn't heal like he normally does. His age is starting to show and he's constantly drinking to deal with his pain.Things are looking pretty bleak until he runs into a creepy representative of Transgien Corp. named Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) who is tracking a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen). Her mother tried to stop Logan and offer him a job escorting them to the North Dakota border for $50,000. Logan turned her down but reconsiders and when he goes back the next day, he finds her murdered and Laura climbs into his car looking for help.The biggest headline when it comes to Logan is that its Hugh Jackman's last performance as Wolverine. Through thick and thin, he's always been committed to the part and he's consistently been a bright spot in the X-Men franchise. He's just as good in Logan if not better. He does a great job showing Logan's inner pain and his ruthless energy carries this movie. He obviously threw his all into this and he's awesome as this dark and tormented version of Wolverine. Patrick Stewart gave a different kind of performance as Xaiver in this movie. His dignity and intellect are largely stripped away and he does a great job showing Professor X as this shell of his former self. Dafne Keen was excellent as X-23, this was one of the better kid actor/actress performances I've ever seen. Her intensity is crazy and she holds her own completely against Jackman and Stewart. Boyd Holbrook was fine as Pierce, he does a serviceable job and he's effective in his part. I also really like Stephen Merchant as Caliban, he's normally a comedic actor but he's pretty solid in a fairly dramatic part. I applaud him for stepping out of his wheelhouse.Logan continues a trend in blockbuster movies that I really like where its not afraid to tell a more intimate and condensed story. It doesn't always have to be about saving the world from some overly elaborate threat. This story is essentially about Logan protecting Laura and Professor X from this corporation and they set this story up as more of a western. Some of my favourite moments in this movie are away from the action (the scenes where they take shelter at a farm were some of my favourites) and the interactions between these characters were easy to get swept up in.The tone of Logan is pretty bleak and for those who are going into this expecting more of the same from Wolverine and X-Men franchise, you'll end up either very surprised or very disappointed. This movie is really about Logan's inner turmoil and his struggle to come to terms with what he's done over the years. The action matches the tone by being very violent. I actually liked that about this, Wolverine has always been an edgy character and seeing him brutally deal with his enemies fit. The action is well-filmed and capitalizes on our hero's abilities. X-23 is something to watch in those scenes too. She mows through people and yet due to the film making, it never seems too implausible.Logan isn't my favourite X-Men movie, it holds 2nd place for me behind X-Men: First Class (I also liked Deadpool a little better but I feel like that one belongs in a different category). I have very little to complain about when it comes to this. I do feel like the hype for this movie has gotten a little out of control. Logan is great but I wouldn't say its the best superhero movie ever. I think this is a stellar movie that gives hardcore fans of Wolverine what they want. I'd give Logan an 8.5/10","

"Logan","stuffkikker","28 June 2017","I don't know about you, but when I watch a superhero movie, I expect a colorful carefully crafted universe with cool characters, cool bad guys, lame superhero jokes and stunning visual effects. Guardians of the Galaxy would be the perfect example of that. Loved it! In the end I want that 'aw yeah!' feeling. I don't mind some serious issues here and there and some sad moments, but the overall experience of a superhero movie should be an uplifting and energizing one.This was not that. This movie was dark and grim. And depressing. Just depressing. No memorable bad guys, no impressive epic sceneries, no superhero humor. Just a lot of misery and death.","

Heroes where created to give hope in difficult times and of course to entertain people and now its all gone . I know this was in the comics too ( Every Heroe dies ) but making it a movie was just like saying goodbye to childhood and it was awful! First of all if they continue to make movies with heroes die then one day we will wake up and their will be no more new hero movies to see. Plus SERIOUSLY THEY DIE FROM NORMAL HUMANS???? Like sure you have so many great powers but humanity will kill you either way. JUST NOO!!!","

"Logan","neil-476","15 May 2018","Logan's mutant healing factor is finally being poisoned by the adamantium in his system. He is working as a limo driver while tending a frail Charles Xavier, suffering from dementia. He is abruptly put in the position of having to nursemaid a mute 11-year old with retractable claws who is on the run from an organisation which wants to recover its investment. He is not happy. After his breakthrough performance as Wolverine 17 years ago in the first X-men film, Hugh Jackman has played that character in all of them, albeit by way of cameo in First Class and Apocalypse. The intervening period has been such a fertile period for comic-based movies that it is easy to forget that Brian Singer's first movie was a trailblazer for the ensemble super-hero film. But I think it is not unfair to observe that, no matter how good the scripts, how epic the effects, how committed the performances, all these super-hero films have been fairly shallow and superficial. There's nothing wrong with that - what else do we expect from super-powered escapism?Not so with Logan. The joy of the X-Men films is that the internal continuity and, importantly, the passage of real time outside - and, therefore, also within - these films, have brought us to the position which allows this movie, a movie about familiar characters growing old, to take place. Yes, there is Wolverine action, but the heart of the movie is watching this weary and damaged man cope with his relationship with Xavier, father figure, mentor and, as a feeble but dangerous 90 year-old, a damn nuisance, and then also coping with a mute and feral child, a major problem even without Xavier and the hordes of mercenaries after her.This is a film about fathers, sons and daughters, and may strike chords if you have elderly dependents and wilful teens in the family. It is also about earning redemption.Oh, and it's about what the comics refer to as Berserker Rage.The plot is straightforward. The various trailers have shown the set-up fairly comprehensively, but most of this material is drawn from the first half hour. There are some surprises in what follows, but nothing which will be completely unexpected. This lack of surprise does not detract from the performances: both Jackman and Stewart are superb as Logan and Xavier, adding depths and emotional nuances to the characters which we never imagined from the previous films.They aren't the only ones giving us great performances. Newcomer Dafne Keen is astonishing as the mysterious clawed child Laura, both in terms of her physicality and the striking performance she gives without dialogue. And lanky English comedy writer and performer Stephen Merchant is a delightfully sympathetic Caliban. Sadly, the villains disappoint. Boyd Holbrooke's baddie Pierce leaves little real impression, and Richard E. Grant's Dr Rice is underwritten. Never mind: this film belongs to the three principals.I have deliberately been fairly light on the detail, but there are a couple of things I should mention. One is that this movie is NOT kiddie friendly. The first word spoken is ""F*ck"", and this is repeated frequently, rather too much in my view: I like language to serve the narrative, and much of the profanity here seems to be present simply because F*ck. The film is also graphically violent. We finally get to see what those claws do, in full and gory detail. So if your kids love the X-Men, treat them to the old TV cartoons, not this one.I'm not going to spoiler the ending other than to say that it is emotional, especially in its closing note, a beautiful and perfectly fitting touch which caught me by surprise.I'm sure there will be other X-Men movies - why not? There are many X-Men who haven't yet featured on film - but I doubt there will be one as good as this one for quite some time.","

"Logan","Jadamwood","7 May 2017","This movie is both dark and enlightening. This movie has amazing acting performances by all main characters including the actress who plays the young girl. The realistic violence that can only be captured by maintaining the ""R"" rating is something I feel is both necessary and fulfilling of the wild nature of Wolverine is supposed to be. I fully enjoyed this movie and once you get past it's dark nature, it has so many beautiful heart wrenching turns that is unprecedented in Wolverine or anything I've seen in the superhero type genre.","

"Logan","bkrauser-81-311064","3 March 2017","Logan hits its audience with the hardened fist of a seasoned prizefighter in his last match. The feeling is elating, intense and at times too brutal to bare. At once the film feels like a last hurrah and the culmination of every claw, every jab and every wound the Wolverine has received or doled out over nine films. Embodied in its solitary, grizzled and tired titular character however is an uncommon weight. Movies like this have been made before, that much is obvious - and while it's easy to predict Logan's every plot-point to a T, rarely has a movie like this been bolstered by so much, already laid cultural cache. In that specific regard, this latest X-Men movie (2000-Present) is a resounding success.Logan takes place in a distant future (we think), where all of mutant kind has been wiped out (we think) except for a few unfortunate souls. Among them is Logan (Jackman) who at this point works as a part-time limousine driver and full-time caretaker for the ailing Professor X (Stewart). Apparently something serious happened back at Xavier's School, forcing the nigh untouchable Professor to take refuge in a hollowed out water tower south of the border. Only the Wolverine and a mutant named Caliban (Merchant) are there to witness his slow slip into senility. Things however take a sudden turn, when a desperate nurse (Rodriguez) tasks Logan and his compatriots with taking care of a very special little girl; a girl who just may hold the key to Logan's ultimate redemption.Redemption is an ongoing theme in this film, not just for Logan but seemingly for everyone involved. Logan takes care of the aging professor not out of compassion it would seem, but rather as a form of penance for regrets of the past. Likewise, Caliban, Xavier and even the nurse are trying their best to right past wrongs and ultimately put a lot of their stake on the mute and instinctual Laura (Keen).She comes, of course, with a dark and complicated past which is likely to put fans of the comics in a tizzy of anticipation. Those not in the know however will see much fault in the myriad of plot details that, on their face, are as patently ridiculous and as they are cloyingly persistent. Anyone who has ever listened to more than five minutes of conspiracy theory radio or knows anything about the Birch Society will be rolling their eyes as the big baddie comes in to explain his complicated web of intrigue.Yet what makes Logan so refreshing, so new, and ultimately worth a recommendation is its fidelity to story and character. Aspects of characters' powers, an all-important fixture in superhero films, could just as well be replaced by guns or samurai swords. The things this film actually cares about - the internal conflicts, the understated pacing, etc., exist and persist regardless of how many times Logan bares his claws or X reads people's minds. There are frantic chases and grizzly fight scenes, sure, but they're just icing when compared to Logan's gradual shift from a man of solitude to a man of compassion.This of course frees up the movie to move at a much slower pace than its briskly-paced predecessors. There are a handful of moments where the movie just seems to stop and smell the fertilizer. These moments don't so much serve the plot in expected and slavish ways, but rather gently bends to the film's weighty themes, in a way feels like a reward for sticking with the X-Men for so long. And while it's not necessary to know everything about the other films to enjoy Logan, those who quite literally grew up with the character well get everything they ever dreamed of and more.This includes of course, a hard R rating that enamored fans will likely point to as decisive proof that these kinds of movies are more than just entertaining trifles. And yes it's true while DC movies like Batman Vs. Butthead (2016) folded under the pretentious smuggery of fanboys screaming ""look mom comic books can be smart too!"" Logan actually takes that same ball and runs away with it.Kinda like when critics reference old movies no one has seen! Yet I wouldn't be so fast to mark Logan as the best comic book movie since The Dark Knight (2008). We have come to a point in the genre where shared universes and constant sequels, prequels, spinoffs and post-modern Deadpool (2016)-like meta-commentaries have yielded a nearly closed ecosystem. One in which those outside of the hype may not get some or even most out of the story. Within that context, those on the outside will simply see a pulpy, competently made if ultra-violent redemption story that overstates its importance with one too many Shane (1953) references.In today's throwaway culture finding a comic book movie this outwardly risky is actually quite a surprise. It antes up most of its cultural stockpile and bets big on a forcefully adult story, then bets big on fan's goodwill and patience. What results is a movie that doesn't ""transcend (the) comic-book genre,"" as USA Today so carelessly asserts but rather transforms the genre in new and exciting ways. I'm anxious to see where this leads and worried the inherent goofiness of the genre will be wiped away completely like so much Spider-Man 3 (2007). For now though I'll just say Logan is worth a look and keep my sense of dread to myself.","

No part of the information that is being offered explains why Logan would end up in that living situation or where all the already existing mutants are while this is happening. The plot is full of logic holes and too much of it simply doesn't make any sense. I have no idea why this movie was made.","

"Logan","DarthVoorhees","12 March 2017","It is hard to say exactly how I felt about 'Logan'. It is a movie that strives for a more visceral reaction than any of the recent Marvel or DC films. It has the benefit of finality. I think in some instances we are more prone to fall to some tricks with this being a part of the film. It features brilliant performances from Jackman and Stewart that take the characters to new places. I'll agree with some, it isn't a fun movie. Wolverine is not cracking wise at all. This is a depressing bleak movie. I admire it for it's ability to go there. It has weight and we fear for our characters. They aren't super humans who can laugh at danger. I don't know if I'm putting too much on my personal expectations in against the film but I wanted more of the sociological commentary and satire that the X-Men universe delivers when it is at it's best. We get some interesting seeds of it but they aren't sufficiently fleshed out. It is in essence a chase film and it can't really stop for too long to asses it's world, which is a shame. I really like the subplot of Xavier suffering from dementia and the dangerous implications it has. The villain's motivation is delivered briefly and the way mutants have gradually become extinct is actually really clever. I guess I'd like to see an X-Men movie within this sort of bleak framework. The R rating is deserved but the film is guilty of going for gratuitous R rated material. Logan is hiding out as a limo driver and a drunken Prom Queen flashes him. Isn't that just going for R material because you can?The strengths are undoubtedly Jackman and Stewart. This is a film for people who appreciate good acting. Jackman is more isolated in his character. He doesn't have the same zest or humor. This is an angry and bitter man. I think this is why the film works and has resonated with people. We needed the other films in the series to get here. In comparison to other comic book films we've never seen a character change this dramatically or have war wounds over the course of a series. Logan does not want to reach out anymore. The only regret I have is that the script is incredibly vague about what illness Logan is suffering from. I think it would have been interesting to get an idea of what exactly is killing him. Stewart may be the highlight of the film. Xavier was always superhuman and always composed. To have him lose that razor sharp intellect and wit is to make him vulnerable. The theme of Logan is mortality and Xavier's is believable. I honestly believed it and that is saying something given that this character has come back from the dead. There's a scene played perfectly by Stewart where Xavier recollects the fragments of his memory and realizes he has hurt a great many people. It is a real human moment that isn't over-dramatic or philosophical about superheroes. We see the humanity of a fearless character brought low to fear.'Logan' isn't perfect in my estimation but few films of the comic book genre are. It is an example of the comic book genre done right. It is built on acting and brilliant character writing instead of spectacle. The MCU definitely needs to look at 'Logan'. Sequels can be fun but eventually a character has to be defined even if it means coming to a bitter end.","

"Logan","iamdennisjoseph","25 June 2020","We have loved Wolverine ever since we first saw him in 2000 on the first X-Men film. He's the antithesis of a superhero - strong but dark, powerful but violent, and able but troubled. For the last 17 years, he's always got a special place in our viewership.I adore Logan. As the final installment to the X-Men spinoff trilogy, I couldn't ask for a better one. The R rating toned the superhero cliche down, all other aspects of the film came together perfectly. Acting was outstanding, less is more it was for the characters. Action was brutally satisfying there were times I felt like I was watching them kill walkers in The Walking Dead. The story line never dared to become convoluted. It was subtle but well-paced, I didn't have a headache.
Weird but I'd consider Logan as a 'feels' movie. It was a journey that put me in the shoes of Wolverine and Professor X. How they needed to bring a young mutant to a safe place is a homage and farewell to their characters which we have grown up with. The movie is a closure we needed to put to rest some of the most trusted superhero figures we've held on to for decades. No one told them we're tired but we gotta admit, we saw this coming.'Logan' is an outstanding film because it's a superhero film not about what superheroes can do but about what they can't anymore. While that may be painful, the irony and lack of power made it more relatable, more real.Who knew a little bit of realistic drama was all the X-Men franchise needed all along?So long, Wolverine. So long.","

"Logan","Mr-Fusion","7 July 2017","Wolverine finally gets his R-rating, and it's a double edged sword. The bright side is that the berserker rage really means something (straight up hack-n-slash, baby). The unpleasant side to this is that there's no shortage of punishment in this movie and that's no more evident than in the lowly states of Logan and Charles Xavier (putting aside the ending, it's heartbreaking to see Patrick Stewart wasting away like this): this world has taken an unbelievable toll on both.It's a painful movie, hitting on everything from death to (fragile) hope to even child abuse; and pretty much everything you'd want in an old-man Logan tale.But my god, is it bleak.7/10","

This movie is a great from beginning to end.Hugh Jackman as Logan, better known as Wolverine, delivers an amazing performance in his last movie as this iconic character. The same goes for Patrick Stewart as Professor X. Although personally I have never been attached to FOX's X-Men movie series. In 2 hours, I felt connected to Logan and his journey to return his clone daughter to Canada.This is not a traditional superhero movie, and that is why I loved it so much, it shows a side to characters we know and love that we have never seen before. The atmosphere of the movie ranges from stressful and deserted, like the beginning, to beautiful and peaceful, like when they are having dinner at the farm. It got really emotional in these kinds of soft scenes, as seeing Logan smile despite his stressful situation brings a lot of humanity to his character.For me, this movie stands on its own, and that is a reason that I loved it so much. I recommend seeing Logan even if you skipped all the other X-Men movies.","

"Logan","j_forbesy","5 March 2017","Logan is the final chapter in Hugh Jackman's Wolverine story. With it's R rating and darker tone, this had the potential to be Marvel's (well Fox's) Dark Night, or burn where it stands like the other Wolverine film. Thank god it was the first one.In Logan we get an old Logan, an Old Man Logan. While it is extremely loosely based off the comic, it was still great to get this older Logan that just doesn't care. His aged, his body isn't like it use to be, and his starting to become a grumpy old man. What was so great about this aged version of Wolverine, is you can see the younger Wolverine from previous film turning into this guy over time. Everything he did didn't seem out of character and he still had the Wolverine personality he has had for 17 years. I think much of this is down to the performance of Jackman. No matter what quality of X-Men movie he has been in, he has nailed Wolverine and this film is no different. As well as being Jackman's last appearance as Wolverine, unless there's a Deadpool cameo, it was also Patrick Stewart's last appearance as Professor X. I've always really like Patrick Stewart as Charles, despite not jumping into the X-Men franchise til the new incarnation of McAvoy had come about. In Logan, Professor X is aged and unstable and I liked them playing with the idea of what would happen when the most powerful mind in the world becomes old. Through seizers that is able to freeze everyone in their place, we got to see how dangerous Charles has unintentionally become in his old age. While I've always really liked Professor X as a character through the other films, I think this is my favourite version of him because he comes with so much depth and history that he feels like this powerful and wise mutant. Again like Jackman, Stewart's performance is outstanding during this film and what is done with the character is because of what Stewart was about to do.Moving on to our new mutant, Laura, aka X-23, was an absolute hit with me. Not meaning to get repetitive but the performance by Dafne Keen brought this innocence yet uncontrollable aggression to the character. While I'm not too familiar with the character itself in the comics, I felt like they were able to give her a great origin and make it clear who she is and how she has come to be. While this film is an end to an era in many ways, it still leaves a slight gap open to a new series, which I would personally be all for because we would have X-23 leading the pack. She was such a strong character and it is disappointing that we probably aren't going to get more of her story because she's a character you want to follow. Now onto the R rating. This film needed it. While Deadpool needed the R rating for the humour, Logan needs the humour the the realisticness. This is the most grounded and realistic X-Men film we have ever gotten. We are in this lived in and matured world that not giving it the realistic treatment. The main reason for the R rating is the language and violence, very similar to Deadpool, however it was used in such a different way. We got to see what Wolverine is, a killing machine, and not only that, his an aged killing machine that just doesn't care no more. With that comes the violence and gore that we got in this movie. As far as language goes, it's one of those things that when it's not there you don't notice it, but when it is, you appreciate it. While the language wasn't too vague in anyway, being able to have the characters say what they do is more realistic than anything else in this movie. These are mutants who have gone through hell, and being able to see them do simple stuff like drop an F bomb when their frustrated or express their surprise with language gives them more of a realistic feel than I would have gotten from anything else. Touching on the villains, while they weren't the strongest villains you could think of, I didn't mind because they didn't have an extremely strong presence. They act as a way to further the plot and push our main characters further in the story and that's all they need to do. When they are great when they are on the screen they are great and their villain presence is felt and that's all I wanted them to do, especially a certain one that pops up mid way through the movie. For the most part this is a story about Logan's final chapter and him having something he has never completely had his whole life.For me, there is only one slight negative through this whole film and it's something that I didn't think of til much later. During the film they touch on what happened to the other mutants and while it give you a pretty decent idea as to what happened to them, there is part of me that wanted that bit more and to actually see what happened. It was just one of those situations where I thought they could of done a ""show not tell"", however I can see from a length point of view as to why they went about it the way they did.Overall I loved this movie. After Deadpool last year I never thought I would see a Fox Marvel property that I liked more but this is it. This is the Dark Knight for a Marvel character and it's going to go down as one of my favourite superhero movies of all time.9.5/10",NA

It's the best cinematic superhero thriller movie of all time. The main character of the movie is Logan, who is 100 years old that's why his healing powers not more stronger than before. Every graphics & sound system are very specific. I had seen all the part of X-Men but Logan is notable better than all part. Specially I like two part of X-Men. Logan(2017) & X-Men origins Wolverine. Cause there are many strong mutants in movie like Victor, Bloob, Zeru, John & the mutant killer the Deadpool. If you like science fiction-action-thriller cinematic movie, you should watch this movie. I'm very sad when I saw the die of Logan.",NA
"Logan","foleydavidazzopardi","28 July 2021","Although definitely not for children or younger audiences, Logan is the culmination of 17 years of cinema and comic movie history that matured with it's original audience and ties things off perfectly.Sad, brutal and well-crafted in all aspects.",NA
"Logan","WeAreLive","4 August 2018","Logan is the final movie in terms of Hugh Jackman's wolverine and possibly Patrick Stewart's Charles.In an alternative timeline all of the X-Men are gone. Wolverine and Charlas are the only ones that are left as Wolverine is getting old and week in terms of heal, while Charlas is getting sick.Both Charles and Logan discover a girl by the name of X-23 who has the same powers as Logan. But unlike logan she only has two claws and they must keep her safe and unite her with the next generation of mutants.This was a satisfying pay off as Hugh Jackman's last movie as Wolverine, when there was dreama or action it didn't feel forced and the best part is that the movie is R rated.If you loved both Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman as their characters or just generally loved their movies. I am telling you now you are in for a treat,",NA

"Logan","getuliohf","2 May 2020","This story is just great. The characters are fantastic and the acting of the little girl is notable. Her angry face can be so tender when crying that took me into tears. The end of Wolverine couldn't be better than this. A pitty but necessary to get a final road for this unforgetable character, so well interpreted by Hugh Jackman, as well the incomparable Patrick Stewart, finishing the saga of Professor Xavier, our eternal Captain Picard.",NA
