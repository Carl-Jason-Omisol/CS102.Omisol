"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Big Movie Fan","5 May 2003","Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hard-earned money to see X-Men 2. It was worth every penny.Firstly, the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The X-Men-with their forty years of history and continuity-are perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well, I've spoken to many hardcore X-fans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The X-Men and their enemy Magneto have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years, I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.All the favourites are back including my personal favourite Hugh Jackman as Wolverine (I hope Wolverine gets his own movie franchise one day). The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many X-Men (and women), the producers have to do the best they can; and they do indeed.There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies, the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore, the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics (and movies) have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as Hitler's treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of Martin Luthor King and Malcom X. In fact, many longtime X-fans have compared the X-Men's Professor X to Martin Luthor King and the evil Magneto to Malcom X. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.This is the best superhero film since the 70's (when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie) and the 80's (when we saw Tim Burton's Batman). It was a fantastic film but it begs one question-how are they ever going to top this?","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","suicidea","8 January 2004","A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone's opinion, I really don't see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.(Definitely NO spoilers ahead.)First of all, we must realize that X-men comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still, the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon, but Bryan singer did a very good job (as always) in the first film, and introduced the audience. Besides, adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job, and is also risky, considering it's Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.The second film, however, had to concentrate (naturally) on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object (in the title) to people criticising this film for ""lack of character development"" etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read x-men comics, and did not even see the first movie, and see this one right away and still expect the director/writer to spell things out for you, well, you'll be disappointed. ""Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack?"" someone asked. To hide them somewhere, THAT'S where he took them. I don't think people would like to see the director spell out everything, such as Colossus' inner voice saying, ""Well, let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility, to hide them from the bad guys.""And the newly-introduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities, you see whose side they're on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done.The movie had many shortcomings, of course, the pace slowed down more than once, some main characters, especially Cyclops, were almost lost, but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler, who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first, much more like the original comic character.As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well, bad news for you. X-men is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters, hopefully to be seen in the next sequel(s). Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I'm eager to see Gambit also, I can't wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course, I can see the ""no character development"" people asking each other, ""Who is Beast?""In short, this movie does what it's supposed to do: Gives us entertainment, and shows us our favorite characters on screen.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","MinorityReporter","12 December 2005","Some people would tell you that X2 is more conventional and mainstream than the first movie and to that I can only say: What a load of rubbish! Not only does X2 continue in the style set by the first film but it also improves on it greatly. This is achieved by adding more characters, making a deeper story and making the ever expanding universe even more chaotic so as better to capture the essence of the comic book. Two thumbs way up! The story picks up after the events of the first film in a way that pleases the viewers of the first film and is satisfactory to new viewers. The story is still well written and the pacing has improved a lot from the first film. There are no real slow points during the movie and the director takes special care to cram many of the scenes with breath taking visual effects so the audience will never lose interest. The dialog is once again both very sharp and witty and intelligent and allows for adequate character development. The character development is something some people have seen fit to criticize as they claim there isn't enough of it and except for only two characters I whole heartedly disagree. The character development of the main characters happened pretty much in the first film and therefore it is only necessary to add a bit more depth to the characters instead of repeating the character development from the first film. I did feel, however, that the film seemed somewhat rushed at times and that is a shame as it definitely had potential to be a 2Â½ hour film.The acting is still sublime and I, of course, have to emphasize Hugh Jackman who is still absolutely brilliant as Wolverine. Both in bringing out the animal sides during the fight sequences but also in keeping the character human like in the comics. Ian McKellen returns as well and further fleshes out his character of Magneto and makes the character every bit as devious and charismatic as in the previous film. Patrick Stewart returns as well and does what he did in the first film and he is still the only one who could play Xavier. Among the new actors are Brian Cox and Alan Cumming. Cox does what he does best and plays the new villain with the exaggerated style he usually does. Cumming on the other hand shows remarkable depth as Nightcrawler and is in spite of his appearance one of the most human characters in the film. I will miss him in the third film. Lets hope Beast is any bit as good as in the comics. Some have had their characters lessened in the sequel. Most notably James Marsden while Famke Jansen's character is developed further. Halle Berry's character Storm is still kept in the background but I'm sure she will get more screen time in the third film. Aside from the ones I have now mentioned the acting is quite good all round.Action wise the film took a major step up from the first film and many of the action scenes are quite simply awesome. We get to see more of Wolverine's feral rage which is always worth a look. All fights scenes with Wolverine are awesome and some of the most entertaining I've seen. Also we get a brief glimpse of Collosus kicking some ass and he does look cool I must say. In fact many of the individual mutants' powers are fleshed out in X2 and like in the original X-Men film they look absolutely beautiful. My only concern regarding the effects and action scenes is how on earth they are going to top them in the coming third X-Men film.In regards to music and sound the film improved upon the first film with a much more catchy soundtrack and more audible effects. For example the sounds of Wolverine's claws shooting out and retracting have been amplified making him even more menacing than he was in the first film. Very well done.All in all X2 is an excellent continuation of the original film and we are nearing something that is more like a saga than a series of films. I'm really beginning to see Bryan Singer as a master director after these two brilliant films and I am a little sad he opted to do Superman Returns rather than finish what he started with the X-Men films.8/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","TheLittleSongbird","24 July 2014","Not that the first film was bad, because actually I still found it good, well-made fun for all its flaws. It's just that whereas the first X-Men film did feel like the beginning of a franchise that was yet to properly find its feet, it was found with X2. X2 isn't perfect either but still a very good film that is bigger and darker than the first and all the better for it. Again X2 is very well-made, with the dark visual style still maintained yet with a slightly grander look. The photography is beautiful and atmospheric, and the special effects are better here too, they were good in the first that they're slicker, bolder and eye-popping in the way that the first film didn't quite but almost did achieve. Whilst Michael Kamen's score in the first was fine, John Ottman's score here is an improvement being more in tune with the atmosphere and what's happening in the story. The script is even sharper here and with more depth, the humour and comic one-liners are witty and genuinely funny, they are not cheesy or out-of-place nor are they too much. There is a melancholic tone too that is dark and quite poignant and the romantic elements are sweet but never too soap-opera-ish. The story is where the darker and bigger terms most apply, apart from a couple of parts that could have slowed down and explained themselves more you are glued to your seat almost the entire time and emotionally connect with scenes and characters too. The assault on the White House sequence is exciting and a brilliant way to start the film, and it is true that the climax here puts the climax of the first in the shade, it's not contrived in the slightest and you are biting your nails. X2 does a great job mostly with the characters, where they are more complex and relatable. Although once again Storm and Cyclops are underdeveloped, otherwise Wolverine is a gritty and identifiable anti-hero, and of the other characters Nightcrawler was most effective. Though once again credit is due for making Magneto much more than a stereotypical villain. X2 is very well played by the cast, with the standouts being Hugh Jackman's charismatic Wolverine, Ian McKellen's menacing Magneto with shades of melancholy, Alan Cumming's camp yet affecting Nightcrawler and Brian Cox who plays Stryker with relish without falling into clichÃ© territory. Also good are Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who continues to be sexy and icy, and her transformation sequences are among the visual highlights of the film and Patrick Stewart still is cool and fun though his screen time should have been longer. Only three cast members don't quite work, and they were James Marsden who's even stiffer than he was in the first(not helped by his character not been used as well as he could have been), Halle Berry who looks bored and Shawn Ashmore does look awkward at times. Other than a couple of rushed, under-explained parts, a couple of characters given short shrift and a couple of performances that didn't quite make the grade the film is a touch overlength, but the film on the whole is very good and lots of fun in its own right. It compares extremely favourably to the first film and manages to be better than it. 8/10 Bethany Cox","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","MovieAddict2016","4 May 2003","The film begins. We are shown a tour guide leading students and adults through the White House in Washington, DC. It seems normal enough. A security guard notices someone straying off the path and asks if he is lost. The man raises his head, and a tail flicks out from behind him. Before the security guard can do anything he is down on the ground, alerting all security in the area of a mutant attack. The blue creature, known later as Nightcrawler, teleports past dozens of guards and kicks and whips them with his tail and fists. Finally the action dies down with the creature being shot (not killed), and we are left to catch our breaths. Reader, I'll tell you, it took me a few moments to catch mine.It sure looks as if ""X2"" is on the right track for a sequel, and if anything, it seems better. The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film, and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning, it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences, just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.But that's not all ""X-Men 2,"" or ""X2"" as the posters abbreviate, is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure, non-stop, full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger, the budget is bigger, the story is bigger, and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side, and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elements/techniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first, but I must say I did.It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.The film begins with an assassination attempt on the president's life, carried out by a teleporting mutant. This act upsets the entire world, and the president is about to begin the mutant-human war predicted by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in the first film. In an effort to get to the bottom of the attack on the president's life, and prevent world-wide war, Xavier sends out Storm (Halle Berry) and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) to search for the teleporting mutant and discover the truth behind the assassination attempt.Meanwhile, Logan ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman) has returned to Xavier's mansion after searching for any signs of his past. He has found none. He is greeted by Rogue (Anna Paquin) and her new boyfriend Bobby ""Iceman,"" who was briefly seen in the first film and is given a deeper character backdrop in this film. But soon things start to turn for the worst as an attack on Xavier's mansion is led by Stryker (Brian Cox), the man behind the assassination attempt, who wants all mutants to be killed off. He kidnaps Charles Xavier, and reveals that he wishes for Charles to kill all mutants.How? By focusing Xavier's psychic powers/telepathy on a particular group of people, Xavier can actually kill them. So Stryker plans to use his disowned mutant son (who also has psychic powers) to control Xavier's mind (sort of) and focus on all the mutants in the world, automatically killing them.With this plot in motion, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) has little time to free Eric ""Magneto,"" which results in a truly amazing escape sequence which I will not spoil for you.Now, in an ironic moment, old enemies must fight together to bring down Stryker before his plan follows through. But the band of X-Men are far from solving their problems, as a new mutant, Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) may stand in their way of defeating Stryker. And Wolverine may also find the key to his past in this mess.""X-Men 2,"" unlike other sequels, improves upon itself. Tragic sequels go to the dogs when the filmmakers are either too proud to try and surpass the original, or are too arrogant to even attempt it. ""X-Men"" was an excellent comic-book adaptation, in more ways than one, and ""X-Men 2"" is only better. It contains more action than ""Spider-Man"" and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original, which is ironic, since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.The cast is first-class, but the real scene-stealer, just like in the original, is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one, just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"".  If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, they need look no farther, because though he may not look the part in this film, Jackman can look very suave and proper (see ""Kate and Leopold""), and is my top choice for the next Bond.Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss. They're never in between. ""X-Men"" was an unexpected hit, but more than that, a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart, action-packed and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before, ""X-Men 2"" improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.I expect ""X-Men 2"" to break some box office records, and unlike other films, I can honestly say that it deserves it.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","george.schmidt","5 May 2003","X2: X-MEN UNITED (2003) ***1/2 Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, Cotter Smith. Superlative sequel and a boost of hyperactive energy in the franchise's arm in the second chapter of the Marvel Comics' cult classic this time with good mutants teaming with bad to stop a bent human military advisor (hissable Cox) out to wipe out both types at any cost. Far-out special effects, new characters (particularly winning is Cumming as the blue-skinned Night Crawler) and non-stop action packaged with kinetic infectious giddiness. Jackman continues to amaze as the tormented Wolverine, Berry is given more to do as the tempestuous Storm, Janssen's Jane Grey is perhaps the most nuanced in her suddenly advance telekinetic skills and McKellen is wellÂmagnetic as Magneto. Fun tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (w/ David Hayter, Zak Penn and director Bryan Singer getting story credits) keeps up with the multi-layered storyline encompassing class welfare, social strata and in general to accept one for who they are and not what they are.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","11 January 2017","With nine films thus far and at least two more on the horizon, all released over a near-twenty year window, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise is something of a wonder in today's world of near- constant reboots and remakes. While it has by no means been a smooth ride, the fact remains that the long-running series has been a widely beloved and infinitely important one, especially when placed into historical perspective. Director Bryan Singer's original entry was one of the first major comic-to-film adaptations that convinced studios and audiences alike that comic-book movies could not only be mature and enthralling, but could be certified hits once again after the genre seemed to die-out in the 90's. And thus, a franchise was born and has stuck around ever since, through thick and thin.It's almost a surprise, however, that one of the best entries in the entire saga came so early- 2003's follow-up ""X2."" With Singer once again at the helm, the film is in every conceivable way an improvement over his excellent first film- it's more thoughtful, more daring, more exciting... I think one could even reasonably say that not only is it arguably the greatest film in the franchise- it just might be one of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time. Yes, it's that good.Some time after the original film, a brainwashed mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) is sent on a mission to try and assassinate the President of the United States under the guise of being a martyr for Mutant Freedom. Despite the mutant being stopped, the troubling event gives Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) the political edge and backing needed to get approval for an ""investigation"" on Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters- but his investigation is actually an invasion, as he storms the school, taking many students hostage and forcing the remaining X-Men to flee. At the same time, Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) are sent on a mission to collect Nightcrawler and learn his motivation for the attack, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) are captured by Stryker's mysterious bodyguard (Kelly Hu) and the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) helps her former leader Magneto (Ian McKellan) escape from his high-tech prison. Soon, the remaining mutants (including Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Anna Paquin as Rogue and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman) are forced to team up with their former adversary to try and stop Stryker's scheme to use Charles and his powers to wipe out all of the mutants on Earth.Given the film's nature as an ensemble piece, it's near-impossible to discuss the performances of each actor individually. But to keep it brief, everyone returning from the original is great in their respective roles. Special commendation goes to Hugh Jackman and his continued excellence in the role that helped to define him as a superstar and to Famke Jannsen, who gets a lot more attention this time around. They are by far the stand-outs of the returning cast. I also highly enjoyed Stewart and McKellen, who bring a sense of class and elegance to their roles and are incredible as always. The newest additions are also outstanding. Brian Cox is one of the greatest actors of our time, and his turn as Stryker is quite remarkable. He gives the character both an easily- ""despiseable"" sense of threat and dread, yet also a nice and subtle sense of pain and pathos. He's a cruel man, yet he has a past that might explain why he is the way he is. Alan Cumming is just magical as the frightened yet also amusing Nightcrawler, and there's a lot of great moments in his performance. And Kelly Hu makes for a fun and furious adversary as Styker's second-in-command ""Lady Deathstrike.""Singer returns to direct from a script by ""X-Men"" scribe David Hayter and the writing duo of Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Singer got his start with hard-hitting thrillers like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"", and I think that's part of what gives him an edge with the storytelling. He plays the stories straight and gives them a sense of real and honest threat, while also maintaining an emotional core that feels realistic despite the outlandish nature of the story and heavy Science-Fiction leanings of the material. He's also a very gifted visual artist with a slick and savage sense of composition and flow that lends itself well to the needs of high- concept action. His work on the series has always been nothing less than stunning. The script is very tightly written and juggles the plethora of characters well- everyone has their moment to shine, every major player has a clearly defined role and arc and the pacing is superb. Some wonderful work is done with the writing, and it's an honest shame that neither Hayter nor the writing partners of Dougherty and Harris were involved in the third entry.The rest of the production is just marvelous. (Pardon the bad joke) Composer/co-editor John Ottman shapes some wonderful and memorable musical themes that compliment the tone and style perfectly, and he weaves together shots and sequences with a masterful touch. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel's visual palette is cool and visually arresting, and his work is just stunningly gorgeous. Some wonderful visual flair is given thanks to his talent. And production and costume design courtesy Guy Hendrix Dyas and Louise Mingenbach respectively is just fantastic. The film is made with nothing but top-notch work from top-notch artists.As it stands, ""X2"" is easily one of the best if not the single best entry in the long-running series. Its phenomenal direction, sharp and thoughtful writing, beautiful production and outstanding cast weave an enthralling and thrilling cinematic experience that still stands tall well over a decade later. It's up there with the best of the best in terms of comic-book movies.There's no other way to look at it- ""X2"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","MaxBorg89","21 December 2005","After the success of the first movie, Bryan Singer brings the X-Men back to the screen. He has stated X2 is the X-version of The Empire Strikes Back. He's not totally wrong: like Empire, X2 is darker than its predecessor, characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way, and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed (there's even a ""I am your father""-style revelation concerning Wolverine's past, which is given more space here than in the first chapter). In fact, the movie could have been named X2: Humanity Strikes Back. That's right, this time it's the ""ordinary"" people who are raising hell, in particular William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who takes advantage of the increasing paranoia surrounding mutants and has the POTUS himself approve his plan to take down the ""monsters"" once and for all. The war is about to begin, and with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Cyclops (James Marsden) gone, the only X-Men left to face Stryker are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), with some help from Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). They are eventually joined by a former employee of Stryker's, the blue-skinned teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), as well as the most unlikely ally around: Magneto (Ian McKellen), who has managed to escape from the plastic prison he was locked up in (the break-out plays like the Marvel version of Hannibal Lecter's escape in The Silence of the Lambs, and yes, that is a compliment).The plot is loosely based on the famous graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills by X-guru Chris Calremont (the villain and the alliance with Magneto are explicitly taken from that story), but Singer makes it all much more apocalyptic (Stryker was simply a preacher in the comic-book), while also having the time to take a look at some of the first film's subplots: the Wolverine-Jean-Cyclops love triangle is taken to a new, unexpected level and the Canadian mutant's forgotten ""origin"" starts getting slowly unveiled (Wolverine: ""Who are you?""; Stryker: ""Don't you remember?""). Jackman is the standout in this movie, as we finally get to see everybody's favorite X-fella lose it and make the bad guys regret they showed up in the first place. Those sequences are a treat for those who have grown up loving Wolverine and his dual, conflicted nature. Another actor who leaves a memorable impression is Cumming with his portrayal of Nightcrawler, one of the mutants people fear the most (he looks like a demon), but also the one who's most willing to forgive mankind for its mistakes.So, with all the great acting, good writing and clever direction, no wonder X2 was voted the greatest comic-book movie ever before Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins were released. This is one superhero opus you won't want to miss.9,5/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","nived84","18 April 2006","2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant ""assistant""/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book filmÂ almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of ""dorky"". The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ivo-cobra8","25 October 2015","X2 (2003) is the best sequel superhero of MARVEL comic book films! In my opinion X2 is the best superhero in the X-Men film franchise. This film is the bomb and it is my second favorite film alongside with X-Men, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: First Class. The effects are a lot of better than in other X-Men movies. The movie itself is great. I liked all of the X-Man trilogy a whole lot, but this one is by far my favorite!This was the only movie that I watch the last one of the X-Men trilogy, it is really awesome movie. I would say by far the best one of the X-Men movies far way better than First Class, Origins Wolverine, The Wolerine, X-Men and X-Men: The Last Stand, the third X-men movie. My favorite fight scenes were fight between Scott Summers Cylops and Lady Deathstrike the Asian chick. She way played by Kelly Hu, she was really hot. William Stryker played by Brian Cox was fantastic he wanted to find and kill all the mutants by using Professor X. This time Magneto escapes from jail he and Mystique join forces and team together with the X-Men to bring and stop common enemy together. This time battle begins in Canada. After Wolverine left for Canada at the end of the first movie to find answers about his past. Here he did not find anything about his past, in stead of that he found an underground that was Stryker's secret lab for torturing Mutants.In the first movie the final battle took place on Liberty Island in New York. In the second movie takes place the finale battle in Canada Alkali Lake. The third movie takes place the finale battle in San Francisco Alcatraz. The attack on Xavier school mutants academy was fantastic and how Wolverine killed most of Stryker 's men. Fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was fantastic. This movie was really the best one. Wolverine did defeat Deathstrike at the end. I love this movie. Patrick Stewart is the best Professor Xavier. One of the best X-Men films ever made and my favorite team one, sorry Avengers but you got nothing on X2. The themes here are so awesome and are perfectly in line with X-Men, the character stuff is fantastic and the action was bad ass. The scene where Wolverines cutting through dudes in the X-Mansion was classic Wolverine. I loved the Nightcrawler in the White House so cool! I wish that I would go in the theater watching this film in 2003, by that time I just wasn't interested watching an X-Men movie, because I didn't understand the first movie, but I do now and It is my favorite superhero film now! I love Wolverine! he is a bad ass! Hugh Jackman is a great actor.X-Men set the standards far as how a great comic supposed to be. This movie is the best out of the 3. Entertaining, fast paced, great storyline. Even if you're not an X-Men fan you will enjoy this. X2 is the movie X1 should've been. The action, storyline and CGI were all improved. Just an overall better, more complete movie. I love this film and it is a bad ass film forever!!! The plot about this film is: The evolution continues in the next thrilling adventure in the X-Men saga. In the wake of a shocking attack on the President, the X-Men face their most dangerous mission ever. They must stand united with their deadliest enemies to combat a menace that threatens mankind... and mutantkind.X2 (often promoted as X2: X-Men United, or internationally as X-Men 2 is a 2003 American superhero film, based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics, distributed by 20th Century Fox.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Devotchka","18 September 2003","This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go.  X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route.  The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.  Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","LebowskiT1000","3 May 2003","The X-Men has always been my favorite comic book, without a doubt. Spider-man is probably in second place, but The X-Men take the cake.  Ever since I heard a sequel was going into the works and Bryan Singer was still on board as director, I had faith that he would do the sequel justice...of course I couldn't help but have that looming fear that something would go wrong.  In the end, the film was released and of course, I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.After seeing the film, I can definitely say it's been a long time since I've come out of a movie theater as happy as I did for this film.  The story was absolutely brilliant and was told in the perfect manner to keep you interested.  ...And of course, there are plenty of new characters and action to keep the audience in awe as well.Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film.  Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) has always been one of favorite X-Men characters, perhaps even more than Wolverine...but that's up for debate. Teleportation has GOT to be one of the coolest and most interesting ideas for a mutant ability!  I was incredibly stoked to see him brought to life on the big screen, Bryan Singer and Alan Cumming did a FANTASTIC job!  Next to Wolverine, Colossus has also got to be one of my favorite characters.  I can't even begin to express how happy I was to see him in the film...although not NEARLY enough was done with him when there was so much potential for his abilities in the film.  Oh well, there's always X-Men 3 right?  The other two new characters, Pyro (John Allerdyce) and Lady Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama) were very well done as well, although not much of their character histories were explained...which is ok, there is only so much time in a film.  The rest of the characters already had a firm basis from the previous film and were all executed extremely well in this sequel, my hat is off to Mr. Bryan Singer, ""Keep up the good work!""The entire cast was absolutely perfect for the film.  Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work, truly fantastic.The story in this sequel is great.  I love the idea of the good and the bad having an equal threat and being forced to work together in order to save them all.  The chemistry and the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Professor Charles Xavier is so bizarre and interesting...and very thought provoking.  There are so many interesting and well done relationships between characters in the film: Logan (Wolverine) - Scott Summers (Cyclops), Rogue - Bobby Drake (Iceman), Jean Grey - Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Jean Grey - Logan (Wolverine) to name a few.  I love just watching them all interact with each other.What it all boils down to is this, if you liked the first film, then you should definitely like this film.  I'm not sure I could say I liked X2 better than the original, but I'd definitely feel comfortable saying it was just as good...and better in certain aspects (but not as a whole).I would definitely recommend seeing this film in the theater or at least rent it when it's released, it's well worth your time.  This film isn't all about super-heroes, action and fantasy, there is a lot more to it than just that and I hope you can see and appreciate that.  I do hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do and thank you for reading my review, be sure to read my review for the first ""X-Men"".-ChrisP.S.  They better start crackin' on a X3 right away!Also..here's some interesting trivia for ya.  In the scene where Mystique is finding out where Magneto is being held she is scrolling through a bunch of names, the name above Lensherr, Erik (Magneto) is LeBeau, Remy...aka ""Gambit""...nice little touch there, I didn't get a look at the other names there, but there might be more allusions there.  Another cool thing is in the scene where the security guard is in the bar, there is a TV on in the background with a guy named Hank McCoy talking...Hank McCoy later becomes known as ""Beast"".  Pretty cool huh...","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Chandler81","16 December 2004","They've done a hell of a lot right. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.Admirably, the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging storyline amongst the bigger picture, and although the story is not without its fault (using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi; been there, seen it before) it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters, and it is for the continued development of these relationships - and not the cool story line and action sequences - that makes me look forward to another X-film.I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant - and it's true, the casting is great - but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me, bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role, and although his role in X2 is small, James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the X-sters as Cyclops. In the first X-film he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags, but he's been left in the gutter for X2, and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act, his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this, and hopefully when X-Men 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm, and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.Thankfully, most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact, Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.Ultimately, there are just a few slip-ups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed, and for the most part X-2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Lady_Targaryen","21 June 2006","X2 is the second part of X men's trilogy. Thanks God it basically has the same cast of the first movie, with new characters like Nightcrawler, Yuriko (Lady deathstrike) and Colossus . (A sad thing that they didn't show in the movie that Nightcrawler is Mystique's son) I noticed that the mansion used for the school also appears as Lex Luthor's home in ""Smallville"" and that both Senator Kelly and William Stryker were born only few days/years apart, what makes strange the statement of Stryker saying that Kelly is his junior.In the movie,Stryker is a high-ranking army colonel who leads an assault into Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro in order to destroy every mutant on Earth. He hates mutants, and his son, is a very powerful mutant with the capability of convincing others with his mind to do what he wants (mastermind, anyone?)to be done. It's sad to see Jean Grey die, but it is nice to see the Phoenix symbol in the water surface.One of the things I love in X men, are the metaphors to reflect current social issues that are always happening in our world, like problems with racism,prejudice,homophobia among others, that doesn't let people live in peace.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Logansneo","7 May 2003","With all the hype surrounding this summers blockbuster sequels, not the least of which is The Matrix Reloaded, as well as having to fight the ghost of Comic-book-movie-bombs-from-summers-past, it goes without saying that a lot of hopes and dreams were riding high on the shoulders of everyone involved in Fox's second big screen outing for everyone's favorite team o superheroes.  Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets, not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker, but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic book-to-film adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2: X-Men United!It has become rarer and rarer to find a film that has the ability to grab your senses and lock your attention so firmly, not ever letting up until the credits role, such as this film does.  One might only be able to count a handful of films where a sequel takes all of the good elements form it's predecessor, completely eliminates the things that didn't work or fit in the original, then goes on to not only exceed the expectations and hype surrounding it, but completely redefines and elevates it's genre.  From this day forward let it be known that all other Comic Book films will hereby be judged and held up the new level of excellence set by Brian Singer's brilliant X-Men 2. And if ya' can't already tell, I kinda' like this flick! ; )I am sure many of you would love to know exactly what makes this film worth spending your money on?  Well, to try and sum it up the characters, their struggles, their dreams, their relationships, they all MATTER because infused throughout this entire production and at isn't core lies HEART! And at the same time the film can be both touching as well as possess a gritty and visceral quality, giving each in attendance license to participate in the action as an outlet for their frustrations and monotony of their everyday lives.  Just as I felt as if I was part of the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings, so here again I feel like I am part of the X-Men team.But what really drives my excitement is Brian Singer's seemingly boundless ability to correctly interpret the true spirit of the X-Men comics.  Individually, as a team, hero and villain alike, he has somehow tapped into the heart of these books and like the title says, united them in a film that defied my highest expectations and ignites my imagination. This is however not to say that he hasn't altered things from the comics.  But unlike other directors from the past who have butchered comic book adaptations, Singer's interpretation of the characters lets you understand that any changes that were made were for the best.  Prime examples of this can be found in how deftly he handles Jean Grey and the silent discovery of her Phoenix powers.  Understanding that it would be totally impossible for him to try and take the Phoenix Saga and directly translate that to film, Singer has rightly decided to do what lesser directors would have cowered at; to re-interpret this change, still showing Jean Grey inherit this power, but to use it to build on her character, and realize HER potential more than most writers of the comics have done in recent memory.  At the same time treating the character with respect as well as both we the audience and the dedicated fans of the comics with that same respect and maturity. Another example of his skills in character interpretation is the way in which he has taken the religious zealot that was William Stryker in the comics and turned him into a much more menacing zealot shill clinging to the original characters' self righteous justifications.  But by giving him the military background and simultaneously making Mastermind his son, as well as merging the scientists who created Wolverine and Deathstryke, Singer serves up an extremely multilayered and more well rounded Stryker with a very clear agenda.  Brian singer accomplishes all of this at the same time he is sewing up crucial sub-plots and characters that are ingeniously and potently utilized.To illustrate the difference between how Brian Singer and the writers/producers for X2 utilize the material and do so intelligently making us pay more attention to the details, and alternately how so many of us have gotten used to dumbed down films that lead us deliberately, treating most of us like children, to their obvious conclusions, I bring up a subject of much debate.  Now some have pointed out that in the ending of X-Men 2 where Jean Grey goes out of the plane to sacrifice herself was unnecessary obviously did not follow what was occurring to Jean throughout the film.  What I saw was her character going through the anguish and realization that something inside of her was reaching far beyond her capabilities to control and after seeing what she was capable of in her battle with Cyclops that at the mom ent she saw that everyone in the team was in danger on the plane, she used this as self justification to sacrifice her life for everyone and at the same time stop the force inside of her which she feared was a growing danger not only out of her control but could eventually threaten or hurt all those who she loved.What other director can you name has so responsibly adapted something like this to film?  I can think of only one off hand, Peter Jackson and his diligence to The Lord of the Ring books.  I dare say the Brian Singer has accomplished more than even Mr. Jackson, because Singer has taken a Comic Book, something the majority of people and press disregard as children's books or even geek literature, and has transformed it into a very HUMAN, very poignant, very real experience, and can only hope that he will continue on what he has accomplished.* * * * * (5 stars)","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ccthemovieman-1","21 September 2006","Since the first movie, ""X-Men,"" was famous for its great special effects, this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans....and it did! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.Having said that, I do think the film needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. It's just too much. Either that, or shorten the story.Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution ""as a fact"" early on once again, they do have something unusual in today's films: a Christian character who was a good guy.All in all, if you liked the first film, you'll like this.","

It builds upon what X1 introduced us to and goes deeper with some characters, specially Wolverine. Nightcrawler's introduction was great and very helpful for later sequences. Also, Magneto had more meaningful action, same with Mystique. Stryker was a decent villain.I'll leave a list of some things I liked about the movie and some thing it fixed from X1.What X2 did well:
Charles being used and manipulated, exposing his weaknessesGave depth to characters stories, specially WolverineNightcrawler's addition and action sequence at the startStryker controlling mutants plotStorm's power being used morePyroWhat X2 fixed from X1:
Less Rogue screen time and dialogue (tho still one too many screams)Choreography* in fighting scenes (X1 ones were baaaaaad)No Sabretooth (YAY)Longer movie timeNo more bad CGIJean Grey's flirting, kinda seemed staged in the X1, feels more fluent in X2So overall, it did a great job on being the stronghold for the franchise establishment.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Theo Robertson","14 December 2003","***** SPOILERS *****I wasn`t all that taken with the original X-MEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X-2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word "" Plot "" but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions , stunts and special effects It`s here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying "" Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but there`s not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters "" and "" The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off "" Note to Hollywood studios - If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after you`ve done that write another one and another
Regardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and that`s the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F-16s on the tail of the escaping X-Men , I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film it`s logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason it`s Wolverine who`s the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters So I wasn`t too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isn`t enough any more","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Michael_Elliott","8 June 2013","X2 (2003)*** (out of 4) After a mutant attempts to assassinate the President, the X-Men must unite to try to defend themselves against a military attack. There's really no point going into great detail about the plot because does it really matter in the end? There's certainly an entertaining story being told here but at the same time there's no question that it's best to just turn your brain off as the movie starts and sit back and just have a blast. There's no question that this sequel is a major step up on the previous movie for a number of reasons. For one, this one here doesn't need a lot of character introduction and instead we're just given one great action scene after another. Whereas the first movie had some good stuff, all of the action scenes are made ten times bigger and ten times better. This includes a wonderful sequence where the mutant school comes under attack from the military. This is preceded by an excellent opening where one of the mutants sneaks into the White House and takes out a number of men trying to reach the President. I'm certainly not going to give away the ending but it too is pretty exciting and full of wonderful effects. Oh yeah, just check out the sequence with the police to see another perfectly directed scene by Bryan Singer. There's no question that the director is much better here as all of the scenes contain some real power and manage to be quite original as well. The actors are all at the top of their game as there's no doubt that the casting was perfect for these roles. This includes Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique. X2 is certainly an above average summer blockbuster that's only real flaw is that it runs on a tad bit too long. Still, this here is very much worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","rosscinema","11 May 2003","I did enjoy this sequel I admit, but I think I'm the minority when I say that its not quite as good as the first film. The first X-men introduced us to a handful (Or two) of mutant characters and we learned about each one of them. The focus of the story was aimed at one thing but here in the sequel they have added so many more mutant characters that the main story is almost forgotten in a windstorm of action scenes. Anna Paquin as Rogue has hardly anything to do here except be frustrated at not being able to be intimate with her boyfriend. This film is definitely geared at a young audience with a lot of the characters being of the teen variety. Halle Berry as Storm is another casualty where her big mission in this film is to get children out of a tunnel. She is absolutely wasted and didn't director Bryan Singer have a better written character for this Oscar winner? The things that I think help the film for me is the mutant Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who is so sexy and strong that even when she's just standing there doing nothing you can't take your eyes off her. If they ever do a film with just her, I'm sold! Their is two performances that stood out for me and the first one is by Famke Janssen who plays Dr. Jean Grey. Its the best written role in the film and she shows real human complexities, she's not just a comic book figure. She's having problems with her telekinetic abilities because of the dreams she's been having and she's also torn between her relationship to two others. The other performance is by Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier who runs the school. He doesn't just posture and allow special effects to run his character, Stewart is too well trained an actor to allow that. In a scene at the end of the film his character is staring out a window reflecting on what has happened and what the future may hold. Even with all the impressive special effects in this film, that scene of Stewart leaves the most indelible image for me. I hope if or when they make another sequel that they try and keep just the main characters as the focus so the overall point of the film doesn't get lost like it seemed to in this film. Of all the new characters introduced here the one I liked the most was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming. Entertaining film but has way to much going on in such a short amount of time. Lets hope they tone everything down the next time.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","LondonOnMyMind","28 January 2006","**SPOILERS AHEAD**X2: X-Men United is one of those sequels that not only continue the narrative of the original film, but also further develop the ties between the characters, making the audience empathize with them. Like the first film, it is a metaphor for society's prejudice. Simply put, this is a film that would be enjoyed by fans of excellent cinema and X-Men comic book fans alike.The direction, cinematography, choreography of action sequences and the overall style of the film are exquisite. The Nightcrawler's (Alan Cumming) teleportation stunts and Pyro's (Aaron Stanford) fire domination left me breathless. The fight sequences and special effects are a sight to behold, without the overdose of CGI that many new films drown in, showing yet again that a good director and creative vision are essential to the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. The cinematography is rich and colorful, painting a warm picture of safety with interior and exterior shots of Xavier's School for the Gifted and, at the same time, hinting at an ominous mystery with the cold shots of Alkani Lake.The emotional depth of the piece is exceptional, particularly today, when frequent gratuitous violence in action and sci-fi movies often detracts from any involvement that the audience might have with the characters. The X-Men films draw on universal themes of individualism and isolation, themes that the second film emphasizes even more than the first one. This time around, the Brotherhood and the X-Men must join forces against General Stryker (Brian Cox), who gives nepotism a whole new meaning and is surely one of the most vile characters in recent sci-fi. As with Rogue (Anna Paquin) in the first film, we again have an outsider, Nightcrawler, who finds kindred spirits in Xavier's group of mutants. From internal conflicts to romantic relationships, the world of mutants is parallel to our own world, making the film relatable on many levels.The acting is again solid. Standouts among the cast are Cumming, whose Nightcrawler is kindness and compassion come to life; Stanford, whose Pyro is a tough, vulnerable and pained human being; and Famke Janssen, whose Jean Grey makes the unimaginable, but inevitable, choice.I would recommend X2: X-Men United to all film fans. However, it is our world today that needs the lesson this film can teach. No one is all that different from the person next to them. Always look beyond the surface.9/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ThereelscoopwithKK","7 December 2023","Unlike many others I didn't enjoy this sequel as much as the first film. I found the story here to be very underdeveloped and mutants powers needed to be sort of edited along the way to make the plot go the way intended. In other words it felt a lot like patchwork. I didn't really learn anything more about the characters than I did in the first one, which you really should with a 2 hour plus film. The Wolverine, cyclops , Jean , love trio doesn't really work for me. None of them are very good at acting it out and it just feels extremely forced. Professor Xavier's role is minimized and I just wish he could be used more .Magneto of course is an excellent villain played by the perfect actor. He's sneaky yet subtle and delivers his lines brilliantly. Stryker on the other hand is kind of a run of the mill villain and not particularly memorable.Overall this movie is still so much better than a lot of the Marvel stuff we get now, but that really isn't saying much.It still certainly encourages you to watch the next one in the series.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Buddy-51","20 December 2003","`X2: X-Men United' is the widely admired sequel to `X-Men,' one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as `different' from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part `irrational fear of the unknown' plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner. Perhaps when it came to `X2,' director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, `X2' starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy `comes out' to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their `ordinary, average' child (whom they had just considered `highly gifted') has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (`We still love you no matter what you are') on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life. `X2' could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.   And it was scenes like this one that made the original `X-Men' soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  `X2' doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.Every so often, `X2' feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a `terrorist' organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clichÃ©s.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?   Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.People seem to be enamored of `X2,' even more, perhaps, than they were of the original `X-Men.'  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view `X2,' for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for `X-Men 3.'","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Chalice_Of_Evil","1 August 2022","Contrary to popular belief, it was 2000's X-Men (NOT 2002's Spider-Man) that saved the superhero/comic-book movie genre after Joel Schumacher nearly killed it with Batman & Robin. Once again, Bryan Singer (no matter what you might think of him) shows the heights comic-book movies are capable of reaching with this sequel. 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's Requiem in D minor has never been better utilised than it is during this film's opening scene at the White House, which introduces the character of Nightcrawler (a blue demon-looking creature...with a TAIL, who might *appear* menacing/'bad', but is later revealed to be the complete opposite). He's a teleporter who can single-handedly take out a bunch of opponents as he 'BAMF's from one place to the next. I have yet to see teleportation brought to life onscreen more effectively than it is here. It remains one of the all-time BEST scenes in any comic-book movie EVER.While Wolverine's having a stare-off with a wolf, trying to regain memories of his past/the experimentation that gave him his indestructible adamantium skeleton, we're reintroduced to the other returning X-Men from the first film. Storm's wig is fluffier/slightly less fake-looking; Jean's having trouble controlling her powers which seem to be growing, Cyclops is still being severely underused (Singer might like James Marsden as an actor, but he obviously cares little for Cyclops as a character given how his screentime keeps decreasing with each movie), Rogue's now together with Iceman/Bobby Drake, the character of Pyro/John has been recast and Professor X uses his telekinetic abilities to make an entire food court of people freeze/stop moving.The dynamics established in the first film are acknowledged (ie. Rogue's attachment to Logan and the Logan/Jean/Scott 'love triangle'), though not dwelled upon, as there's other stuff going on such as the Mutant Registration Act being pushed, Mystique posing as the deceased Senator Kelly, and Brian Cox's very human (but very dangerous) William Stryker launching an attack against the X-Mansion. This is another stand-out scene, as we're not only treated to a glimpse of a new character's power (the metal-skinned Colossus) but also Wolverine going into a 'berserker rage' against the attackers who *may* be considered the 'bad guys', but I was nevertheless thankful to for shutting up that one screeching mutant girl. It's weird that a school FULL of super-powered mutants are seemingly no match for a bunch of human guys with stun-guns (I guess this is why the mutants are mostly kids...because if they were *adults*, they'd wipe the floor with their enemies).Meanwhile, Magneto stages a fantastic escape from his plastic prison with the help of his trusty henchwoman, Mystique (it was nice seeing a non-blue/non-scaly Rebecca Romijn in one brief scene). Elsewhere, Jean/Storm track down Nightcrawler (of all the new characters, Alan Cumming's was easily my favourite, as he brings a LOT to this role, managing to make Nightcrawler scary, sympathetic, and even funny with how he keeps introducing himself to people. He and Storm also have some good moments together, he proves an asset to the team, and although their comic-book connection is never acknowledged, it's fun to see the two blue mutants, him and Mystique, briefly interact). They soon learn his attack on the President wasn't of his own volition, as Stryker has a means of controlling mutants/making them do his bidding as evidenced by his own mutant henchwoman, Lady Deathstrike.Speaking of, poor Kelly Hu (like Rebecca Romijn before her in the previous movie) only gets ONE line of dialogue...but at least her fight with Wolverine helps make up for that. It's definitely a stand-out (being about as intense/violent as a PG-13 film will allow). Another good scene is the one where Pyro makes it known just how dangerous the power of fire manipulation can be. Aaron Stanford plays the part well, and his exchange with Magneto is a good one. It must also be mentioned how very 'mean girl'-like the Magneto/Mystique pairing are towards Rogue regarding her unique hair...which they're responsible for (ignore them, Rogue. Your hair's great!). In most cases, this sequel gives us *more* of everything: more mutants, more fight scenes and more of the different powers displayed...except for Cyclops' and Rogue's, of course, which continue to be frustratingly underutilised.This brings me to the 'negatives' of the film: It's baffling why those^ two characters are wasted and the full extent of their powers aren't taken advantage of, the movie seemingly resorted to ripping off a line from Joss Whedon's series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (replacing the word 'Slayer' with 'mutant') since they apparently didn't have him to supply the jokes this time, and I could've done without the blue-lizard-tongued mutant child/'kiddie humour'. Still, there's a LOT to like: Singer manages to keep things coherent (even when there's some weirdness involving mind-tricks/illusions), Hugh Jackman's Logan/Wolverine continues to steal every scene he's in, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen command the screen whenever they appear, Romijn's Mystique is fascinating to watch (look out for her amusingly rude gesture she gives the bad guys at one point) and, as mentioned, Nightcrawler makes one hell of a debut (such a shame the extensive/time-consuming makeup process put Cumming off returning).These movies have always excelled at is being about something *deeper* than just seeing 'cool powers' onscreen. The way the subject of those who are 'different' is tackled gives these films much more 'weight' than other previous superhero movies had (Iceman/Bobby 'coming out' to his parents as a mutant is one such example). The action, whilst impressive and expertly staged/shot, isn't the main focus of the movie which delivers its 'message' *without* being as ham-fisted/obvious as other more modern superhero movies. Although these films mightn't be the most accurate at translating the comic-books they're adapted from to screen, the 'differences' don't make them *bad* (though you have to wonder what they would've been like if they *had* stuck to the comics more closely). The movie's climax packs an emotional punch, whilst the ending shot promises more interesting/exciting things to come.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","obiwan2005","4 May 2003","""X-Men"" is responsible for reviving the once dead Super-hero genre of movies. Since then, we've seen Spider-Man and Daredevil protecting the streets of New York while accomplishing box-office success. But 'X-Men', to me, is still the best Super-hero movie since Batman. So it will be rather difficult to achieve the same kind of success with a sequel, right? This is the first 'part 2' sequel from the super-hero genre since Batman Returns. So it's sort of testing the waters, on Hero staying power. 'X2' continues right where the first left off. Wolverine arrives back from his trek in Canada,at Xavier's school for mutants. Magneto is still in a plastic prison for his attack on Liberty Island. And all is right for the mutant world. But not for long. A mutant named 'Nightcrawler', attacks the president by infiltrating the white house with his teleportation powers. Which causes civil unrest in the country. Gen. William Stryker finds out about Professer X's mutant academy, and uses the attack on the president as a means to invade it. Here groups of mutants are seperated, but they find out about Styker's plan to destroy every mutant on the planet using Professer X, and a secret weapon. This situation calls for the X-Men and Magneto's (you may have guessed, he escaped) Brotherhood to unite to save the mutant population. While not exactly better than the first, it is better than most original movies. It starts off wonderfully, like the first movie never ended. The production design was consistant with the first movie, unlike the Batman franchise. And the action was superb and top-notch. My only problems are some characters dont get as much screen time as they should, Cyclops for example is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. But he does make the best of it. And the character 'Lady Deathstryke' should have been more developed. She hardly spoke at all. But the biggest problem (while still small) is the movie is a bit anti-climactic. It does have a climax, but a bit toned down for the X-men. Just a bit. Other than that, its an exciting story with a very brave ending. Everyone gave a good preformance. Most notably, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro). The movie progressed the X-Men storyline very well (unlike the Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers. I can't wait to see whats in store for us X-fans, in X3RATING: ***out of****","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","bob the moo","3 May 2003","Following an assassination attempt on the President of the USA by a mutant, General William Stryker is ordered to take action against the mutants. Using information gleamed from Magneto, he attacks the X-mansion, taking some prisoners and scattering the rest.  Wolverine, just returned from the hunt for his past, escapes with Pryo, Iceman and Rogue and sets out to meet up with Storm and Jean.  As the full extent of Styker's plan becomes clear, the X-Men have no choice but to join forces with Magneto to defeat him.I have to be honest I say that every year I get sucked in by the hype machine that surrounds the summer blockbusters.  Most of the time I am let down (Jurrasic Park 3, Planet of the Apes Â the list is long).  This summer looks different with this and the Matrix films to look forward to and X2 was the first one I came to.  I enjoyed the first film and immediately noticed that it's strength had been lost in this sequel.  Here the running time is over two hours and the central plot includes a lot more side issues than the first.  In one regard this is good because there is much to hold the interest.  However it also means that the film doesn't all work Â most of it does but a lot of it feels abandoned or incomplete.  Wolverine no longer is the focus as he was in the first, and this is a loss.  His story is the most interesting to many people but he isn't allowed as much as he deserves. However he fares better than Rogue and Cyclops who barely have anything to do.The central plot is good and has enough twisting to keep you entertained Â only the odd subplot appears to be on a hiding to nowhere.  The action scenes are good on the whole.  The opening assassination attempt is very exciting and the storming of the mansion is solid.  The climax of the film with Wolverine is a little disappointing thanks to MTV style editing making the fight unclear.  Although some people have complained about it being action light, I think that is missing the point.  The film is more about the plot and the characters than just the action.  So we do have lots of dramatic scenes without action but they still work as they are building a wider story.The film is a lot less funnier than the first and hence a little less enjoyable on a surface level.  Mostly this is due to the shift of focus off Wolverine and his lines.  There is still some humour but too much of it is ill-judged (in the middle of Iceman `coming out' to his family Â an emotional point Â his mother says `have you tried NOT being a mutant' Â didn't work for me).  Happily the darker side of the film is stronger and makes this change of tone feel deliberate rather than a loss of humour. Singer directs well overall and uses his budget well Â only the fight between Wolverine and Oyama was one part where I felt he had over stretched his reach a little.  He has nice touches as well Â like including stuff for the harder core comic fans (eg Colossus at one point).  Also there are modern day parallels to be had in the script that are a little bit less than flag waving.The cast really help this film though.  Jackman may not be the central focus for this film but he is the centre of every scene he is in.  Stewart and McKellen both do very good work here and really contribute to the feeling that this is more than a dumb blockbuster.  Berry is OK but on at least one occasion her breasts seemed to be used to greater effect than her character. Janssen comes on a lot and her struggle with her changing powers is well portrayed.  Romijn-Stamos has a much bigger role and her character is used well.  Paquin and Marsden are AWOL even when onscreen but Cumming is a good addition.  Cox is the film's greatest addition and he doesn't allow Stryker to become a carton bad guy at any point. I really like Kelly Hu and was sad t see her have little to do.  In fairness she manages to make a good impression without more than a line in the whole film but her final fight is a little disappointing.Overall this is a superior summer blockbuster.  The way it tries to carry so many subplots and side characters causes it to become very weak and times and not all of it works very well but it is still good for what it is.  The change in tone from the first film will put some off but I enjoyed it and found the story to be well supported Â however for X3 I hope that this ensemble feel is cut back a little and a smaller core of characters allowed to develop well rather than a lot of them developed a little.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","poolandrews","25 January 2008","X2 starts as an attempt is made on the US President's (Cotter Smith) life in the Oval office by a teleporting mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the President sees this as an act of aggression on the part of all mutants & orders Willaim Stryker (Bran Cox) a military General to tighten up on mutant security. However it is in fact Stryker who was responsible for the attack & with the President's authority as well as some forged documents he sets out on his own personal crusade to rid the entire world of mutants, Stryker learns from Magneto (Ian McKellen) that Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) runs a school for mutants & the existence of the Cerebro machine in which Xavier can telepathically communicate with any living creature on the planet. Stryker intends to force Xavier to make contact with every mutant on Earth & telepathically kill them all...Directed by Bryan Singer who also has a small cameo in the film as one of the security men in Magneto's plastic prison this was the sequel to the original X-Men (2000) film the huge financial success of which pretty much got the whole Marvel superhero comic book adaptation thing going with such large box-office returns, the likes of Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), Elektra (2005), Fantastic Four (2005), Ghosr Rider (2007), the Blade trilogy & Iron Man (2008) duly followed to cash in on the cinema going publics craze for these superhero flicks. To be brutally honest I've never really been that impressed with the genre with the notable exceptions being the excellent Blade films & the fun Spider-Man flicks & the silly titled X2 (why not X-Men 2?) does nothing to change my overall opinion. I think one factor is these larger than life superhero character's with all manner of odd abilities were designed for a 2-D comic book rather than a 3-D film & with a few expectations they look better as a comic strip than a live action character, the basic mechanics & demands of a full length feature film are just very different than a simple comic strip. The script by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris & David Hayter is really weak, the character's are poor & lets not forget that not everyone will have read the comics or seen the original film, the story is also very poor. It feels very slow & pedestrian, most of it takes place between mutants in imaginary settings & therefore I found it very hard to think of the film taking place in reality. I know it's pure sci-fi but for it to work it needs to be grounded in some sort of recognisable reality otherwise where's the threat coming from? Also the X-Men themselves are too powerful, between them they can do just about anything including Wolverine who can get shot on the head yet heal himself. You just always felt they would be able to overcome any situation they find themselves in & it just kills any excitement or tension. At well over two hours X2 feels like it goes on forever, there aren't that many memorable set-pieces & as a whole I think X2 is one of the poorer Marvel superhero comic book films.Director Singer does alright but there's not much here that really stands out, there are a few forgettable fights, some exploding cop cars, a bust dam spewing water & a few flashy CGI computer effects. In fact I was quite surprised at how bland & routine feeling the action scenes were considering the budget. I also didn't like the way this was filmed, the scene at the end when Xavier & the rest of the X-Men turn up in the President's office with lightening flashing outside is truly embarrassing. I suspect that it was meant to be sinister & atmospheric but I just thought it looked awful & over dramatic. The special effects are generally very good but like most CGI computer effects you just 'know' what your watching is an effect.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 one has to say X2 is well made with high production values & that big budget Hollywood look & feel to it. I personally thought the acting was awful, the scenes at the end as they mourn Jean Grey are embarrassing, the shots around the camp fire as Magneto fills the rest of the X-Men in on Stryker's plans & they all try to look worried & concerned is another cringe worthy moment as is Rouge's 'scared' reaction when she lands the jet plane at the end. Hugh Jackman can't act, Halle Berry can't act (how did she ever win an Oscar?) although she does look good in tight leather & even great actors like Ian McKellen & Patrick Stewart seem off colour.X2 was a big disappointment to me, I was expecting lots of action & great effects but what I ended up with was a passable superhero comic book adaptation & nothing more. The story is very weak, the character's are weak & the action is forgettable. Followed by X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","freemantle_uk","16 March 2008","X-Men is my favourite Comic Book Series and I loved it when it made it to the silver screen. X-Men was a good film in it own right, but it was really an introduction, especially to people who didn't know the comics. I love X-Men because of its themes of alienation and how to use power. I also love the fact that most of characters, heroes and villains have an ideology, compared to most other comics where the villains are either looking to make a lot of money or conquer the world.X-Men 2 continues a few months after the first film. Nightcrawler (Alec Cumming), tries to assassinate the US President which was one amazing scene and starts the film on a high note. An military scientist Stryker, played by Brain Cox, uses the attack as justification for attacking Xavier's school. Events spiral out of control, Xavier is kidnapped by Stryker and Magneto escapes from prison. X-Men and Magneto are forced to ally with each other to save mutant kind. The film introduces new characters, Nightcrawler and Stryker as already mentioned. Colossus had a brief scene in the film, and other additions were Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. Brain Cox and Alec Cumming's performance were particularly good in my opinion, Cox is normally gives a good performance. Pyro was also fun, especially when he takes on the police outside Bobby Drake's/Iceman's house. Iceman also has a bigger part in this film, especially because of his relationship with Rogue. The film does build on the characters and that was why Bryan Singer's version worked because he focuses on them and the film was the X-Men with action, and not action with the X-Men which what happened in the third film. Singer also took on the film as an outsider because he was never a film of the comics. He was able to cut off some of the stuff that wasn't needed, made the series realistic and did his research on the characters and the story. The film also had some brilliant action scenes, and at times was surprising violence. As already mentioned the opening scene and Pyro attack on the police were great, and so was Magneto's escape from prison, the army raid on the school, the Wolverine vs. Nightcrawler fight and when the Blackbird had to escape for the US air force. In my opinion the action in this film is the best in the series.The film ended with setting up a Phoenix/Dark Phoenix storyline, but the filmmakers didn't capitalise on the opportunity. Loosing Bryan Singer and his writing team was really felt in X-Men 3 and made that film it a disappointment. Just focus on the first two films and ignore the third one.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Wuchakk","10 April 2012","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).""X2"" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in ""X-Men."" More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.""X2"" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and others are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. In other words, the US Government becomes the proverbial ""bad guys."" Take note how Wolverine shows no mercy.Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on character and the way the film eschews moronic ""blockbuster"" conventions.GRADE: A-","

Don't get me wrong it was entertaining and fun but it didn't had the right comic book/cartoon feeling to me. ""X2"" is an huge improvement and it really surprised me how good this movie was! One of the surprises of the year!Advantage of ""X2"" is that it doesn't have to waste time on character introduction because it begins were ""X-Men"" had ended. As a result the action starts right away! And what an action this movie has, the opening attack of Nightcrawler is truly spectacular and an achievement in movie making. The movie has many, many more spectacular fights of which you never get bored and that are all done wonderfully.But not only the action has improved. Also the character have improved in a major way. Storm and Jean Grey have finally become much more interesting and had a bigger role to play, especially Jean Grey plays an important part this time.Also the story has improved a lot. It is a much more interesting story compared to the first movie and it actually has the same feeling as the comics/cartoons, something the first movie was also lacking. I also like how they ""teamed up"" Magneto and Mystique with the x-men this time.Another thing that had improved was the music. I'm sorry to say but Michael Kamen's score for ""X-Men"" was simply not good and didn't fitted the movie. John Ottman's ""X2"" score suits the movie much better and even gives it a more ""superhero"" feeling.So all in all there are only improvements and there isn't much negative to say.Great action, great characters, great story, great movie!

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","DavidSim240183","14 May 2006","With X-Men 3 just around the corner, and having just written a review for the original film, here comes Part 2. And like Spider-Man 2, the action is grander, the characters seem fuller, and the special effects are better than ever. Add to that a much more multilayered storyline and we have ourselves a very impressive 2 hour film.Picking up not long after the first, Wolverine (the ever impressive Hugh Jackman) has gone to the Canadian Rockies to look up his past, and has found an abandoned laboratory complex and not much else. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has been having nightmares ever since Liberty Island, and predicts something dangerous on the horizon. And she's quite right.X2 has a cracking opening scene that is not only a showcase of special effects work but a terrific action sequence. A blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) infiltrates the White House with his power of teleportation, dispatches Secret Service guards left, right and center in an attempt to assassinate the President, and is forced to retreat when he fails.Jean and Storm (Halle Berry) are sent after Nightcrawler while Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) continues to look in on Magneto (Ian McKellen) who is still imprisoned in a plastic cell. Magneto also gets another visitor in the form of William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military colonel who hates mutants. Stryker interrogates Magneto about the X-Men mansion, and most importantly, Cerebro, Xavier's device that can locate mutants all over the world.What our heroes don't realise is they're all the victims of an elaborate trap. Stryker ordered the hit on the President to substantiate his claims that mutants are a threat to society. Nightcrawler is really an innocent who was controlled by Stryker through a special serum. Stryker captures Xavier and Cyclops (James Marsden), then storms the mansion, stealing technical specifications for Cerebro. Stryker intends to use Xavier's exceptional powers of telepathy, amplified by Cerebro, to eliminate every mutant off the face of the Earth.Wolverine manages to get Rogue (Anna Paquin), the cold-inducing Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and the fire manipulating Pyro to safety. While they head off to reunite with Jean and Storm, the shapeshifting Mystique breaks Magneto out in a truly ingenious way that has to be seen to be believed. They form an uneasy alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker's insane genocide plan.Well, that was quite a bit of exposition to wade through! And although X2 requires a great deal of concentration, it's worth it. Bryan Singer has upped the ante, and took everything that was excellent about the original and turned it into something extraordinary for Part 2.Wolverine gets to have most of the fun again, learning that his and Stryker's pasts are linked, acting as babysitter to the young ones, being seduced by Mystique, and getting into a serious fighting match with Lady Deathstrike, a steely eyed vixen with a few steel claws of her own.Rogue and Iceman get to have a bit of a romance, not to mention how interesting it is to watch how they can be together without any physical contact. Some of the gay politics surface again in a 'coming out' scene, when Iceman has to confess to his parents he's a mutant. And Pyro is a mutant who likes his power a little too much. X2 has so many good ideas I could go on all day.The special effects are flawless and perfectly integrated with the characters. There are some marvellous sequences like Storm conjuring up tornadoes, seeing the inside of Xavier's mind, and the gripping finale at Stryker's laboratory.Jean's role is expanded upon, and her feisty nature is played up thankfully. She gets to be the big hero in the end, when she makes a noble sacrifice for the rest. Even Storm seems more improved. Halle Berry is enjoying herself more this time, and her performance is all the better for it. Magneto still continues to impress, throwing out dry insults at every turn, and proves in the end that he still believes in his cause. No wimpified turns of character here!But where some of the characters are given great exposure, others are not. Cyclops is again relegated to the sidelines, and half the film he is absent. Still, James Marsden has yet to impress me as an actor, and he just can't bring Cyclops to life the way the character deserves. And I would have liked to see more of Deathstrike, because she makes a huge impression whenever she's around in a Lucy Liu kind of way.Patrick Stewart is sadly sidelined as well. In terms of plot, it seems necessary, but he made such a huge impression last time it's unfortunate he's not given enough to do. But he does what he can, and it's safe to say Stewart has finally carved out a character all his own, just as he did with Captain Picard.Alan Cumming is a bit of an odd choice as Nightcrawler, but somehow he's quite effective in the role. He's an amusing character, especially the way he's always reminding people of his days in the circus. His teleporting is a definite highlight, and the make-up work is superb.X2 is a marvellous adventure. Everything seems to lock into place in it's own way, firing on all cylinders and hitting the bullseye every time. With a shocking twist at the end creating a grand finale, X2 is up there with the best superhero films. And I'm left with no doubt X3 will be this series crowning achievement.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","filipemanuelneto","5 October 2020","I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with the prequels and continuing, in order to better understand what I was seeing. So this film, which was the second in the franchise, was the fourth film I saw.In this film, the American president is attacked by a mutant. In response, he authorizes William Stryker to make efforts to control and identify mutants, which are now considered a threat to national security. With Magneto trapped in a plastic prison and at the mercy of the army, Xavier's mansion is attacked and prisoners are taken. With a new danger in common, the remaining X-Men are forced to join forces with Magneto, who still has his own agenda.This was the second film in the franchise and gives a logical continuation to the story started in the first film. It is an improvement as the story is denser, darker and with space for mutants that were kept in the background in the first film, as is the case of Storm, who appears more and has more intervention in the story now. Dialogues are good and has some space for well-placed comic lines and also some romance (highlighting Rogue's flirtations and the Cyclops-Jean-Wolverine love triangle). Personally, I felt that this film puts more characters in interaction, which gives more relevance to their dialogues and the way they relate to each other, revealing more of each one's personality. This is most evident with Rogue, Iceman, Pyro and Nightcrawler, which is the most notable addition to the movie's character list.The cast is inherited from the previous film and is made up of proven actors. This is the case of Hugh Jackman, who continued his excellent work as Wolverine, or Sir Ian McKellen, who steals the spotlight when he appears, giving Magneto a threatening perversity and a cynicism full of elegance and depth. Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn and Famke Janssen continue to shine in their respective roles, in such a way that they seem tailor-made for these actors. Among the newcomers, I would highlight Alan Cumming, extremely effective as Nightcrawler, and Brian Cox, who made a good villain. On the negative side, I would continue to mention James Marsden's one-dimensional and tasteless performance, and also Halle Berry, who was unable to take advantage of the extra screen time given to her character, limiting herself to continuing the bland performance of the first film, where her was character frankly secondary. She should have invested more in the character or demanded better material from the screenwriter.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. It is a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually its a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The opening sequence, with the attack on the President, immediately captures our attention for the rest that follows. The scenes and action sequences are great and the climax is a great action sequence, even more tense and interesting than the one we saw in the first film. As in the first film, it has excellent luxurious and detailed sets and costumes. Cinematography is excellent and makes good use of color and shadow to make the film denser, darker and tenser. The editing was also well accomplished, which results in a perfect rhythm, in which there are no dead moments. I think its fair to also greet the makeup department and the soundtrack by John Ottman, which is quite somber and in concordance with the atmosphere of the film.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tabuno","25 January 2019","4 May 2003. Mix together a good ending, with numerous weak plotpoints and warmed over cliches for most of the movie, add an attempt with a more serious human relationship element and you have X-2. In one of the most outlandish superhero plot outlines with unbelieveable attacks on the White House, a super-secret prep school, and the easy capture of our superhero gang, X-2 falls victim to plot devices ask to much of the intelligent audience to make us believe this movie. While the movie going audience can suspend their disbelief some of the time, X-2 gives us an attack on the United States President as its beginning opening scene, but come on really must we have to accept how defenseless the President is, how superheros are so easily left defenseless? This sequel really isn't that original for most of its running time. The scriptwriter just really wants play with the audience's mind and screw up the frustration factor until it wants to burst without consider some of the logical elements of the movie.What really saves this movie is the ending...in one of the more powerful statements of societal responsibility, the climax of X-2 has many of the trappings of other movies, including Indiana Jones and Die Hard, but with a soul. The weaker attempts in X-2 at including the obligatory human dimension are laudable too.So besides yawning and squirming in the seat from pent-up frustration at how should have happened throughout most of the movie, X-2 barely makes it tolerable by the end.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Movie Nuttball","21 March 2004","The sequel to X-Men is here and is arguably better than the first! Though I like both films and I can't decide which is better but both are great and that's awesome! The first was a dark and mysterious film and X2 is a thrilling action sequel! There are more characters in this one though Toad and Sabertooth are not in it but there are plenty of others that are just as cool! The music is by John Ottman this time around and not by Michael Kamen. People may think Ottman's score is more fitting for the sequel than what Kamen composed for the prequel but I think Ottman's score sounds similar like the original score by Kamen which in My opinion is good for the movie! The acting in the film is top notch and so is action and also the special effects! Below is an In-depth look at the characters of the film X2: X-Men United!The characters!Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - Still searching to find out who he is, Logan as he is called finds an empty base up in the great north but it appears empty as it hasn't been used for some time. Since the base is empty and his questions remain will this great fighter return to Professor Xavier back in the states and seek his help or will Wolverine search else where on his own?Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - The powerful minded leader of the X-Men goes with Scott Summers to check on how Xavier's old friend Magneto is doing. How is he doing? Has anything gone wrong in Magneto's prison? If so will these two X-Men be able to handle it without the others?
Ian McKellen as Magneto - Still imprisoned in his plastic jail, Erik Magnus Lehnsherr and the lovely Mystique are still partners from what is left of the Brotherhood of Mutants but will she be able to free Magneto?Brian Cox as William Stryker - This military leader has done some strange things and word has it that he has experimented on mutants? If this is true what kind of experiments were they? Is it possible that he responsible for Wolverine's uniqueness? Is he still active in his duties as of now? Is he a threat to mutant kind and if so will the X-Men be able to stop him?
James Marsden as Cyclops - Still protective over his girl Jean Grey, Scott Summers prefers not to interact with Logan simply because Summers thinks that Wolverine wants Grey to but is this the case?Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - Jean Grey is more powerful minded now and her mind is almost as great as Professor X! If there is a time that the X-Men are in danger will she save the X-Men from an unspeakable situation?Halle Berry as Storm - The Egyptian beauty goes on a mission with Jean Grey on the X-Jet. When enemy jet fighters attack she produces incredible storms but will this be enough to stop the enemy?Anna Paquin as Rogue - Rogue has a more developed relationship with Iceman since time has gone on. Still wearing gloves since she cannot touch anyone and this makes her relationship with Bobby Drake difficult.Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - The beautiful shape shifting Mystique is back and returns as Senator Kelly. The master metamorph changes into many others to her advantage. Does she and Magneto join their enemies? Since she fought and was defeated by Wolverine will she fight him again and have revenge or will she do something else? Does she have a relationship with Nightcrawler? Does she and Rogue have a relationship of some kind and if so what kind would Rogue have with the blue skinned beauty known as Mystique?
Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama - The bodyguard like fighter for William Stryker is quiet but an incredible looking woman. Lady Deathstrike finally faces off with Wolverine and reveals that she is not afraid of him. She battles with each of her long extracted fingers of steel! She also has similar healing like her foe so how can he defeat a woman that has the same techniques as he, is more agile, and a more skilled fighter who knows martial arts?Shawn Ashmore as Iceman - An amazing mutant is Bobby Drake or Iceman as he wants to be called can freeze anything he wants with his hands. Though his relationship with Rogue is difficult but he loves her and will not let her mutant skills get in the way.Kea Wong as Jubilee - She can produce electricity from her hands but what else can Jubilation Lee do?Aaron Stanford as Pyro - John Allerdyce can control fire as a powerful weapon! When Magneto and Mystique arrive on the scene will Pyro join them or will he become a member of the X-Men but what has come to have him make such optional decisions?Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler - Born in Germany and raised by a Gyspy woman, Kurt Wagner went into the circus but when it changed to new ownership he then later was going to be put in a freakshow and he decided that is not his destiny. Even though this mutant known as Nightcrawler resembles a demon of ancient times he is quite peaceful and in fact studies to be a man of God. Wagner is very agile and is capable of teleporting from area to area. With his German accent and kind personality he joins Storm and Jean Grey onto their mission!Daniel Cudmore as Colossus - Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin who is also known as Colossus is a huge strong man and he has the ability to change his body into steel like covering. This steel also makes him have incredible strength!I love the X-Men films and I would really like this franchise to be a trilogy or even a saga! There is so much more that Bryan Singer can do with his projects especially since he has a great cast and knows how to make great movies!  I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at X2: X-Men United!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","filmbuff1970","8 July 2003","After a good opening sequence,the movie follows the route of a big budget remake of the first. Only i found this less than exciting infact i found it boring. A film should never cost this much and be dull. But i have to say the movie is tedious. The dam scenes look poor compared to ones in Force Ten From Naverone. The action is lukewarm at best. Patrick Stewart might as well be playing Picard,spot the difference. Only Hugh Jackman and Alan Cummings deserve any credit. All talk and no action. One Boring Movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","panagiotis1993","22 November 2023","My Live Reaction / Review for X2 (2003): The original Xmen movie was pretty good so I hope this one is too. Imagine being Rogue's boyfriend, sounds like a nightmare to me. Someone attacked the president but the question is why? Nightcrawler looks really cool. The government wants to take over Xavier's school, now that's a dumb decision. Magneto's escape was so badass. I like the way Nightcrawler talks, he is wise. Pyro's powers are pretty cool. They want to force Xavier to focus on the mutants through the Cerebro to kill them? That's so evil. Logan kisses Jean? What the hell? What about Scott? Another (evil) character with adamantium claws? That's cool. Wait, so now Xavier is forced to find all the humans and kill them? Magneto is insane. Jean is gone? That sucks, I hope she is not dead. Overall the movie was great, much better than the first movie. My rating is 8.4/10.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","XweAponX","10 May 2003","This I think was my first ""Comment"" - I opened it up to see if I could make a correction to a typo and now I am being told not that I have too few words of text. Pfaw! Oh Well. I was first in line to see this thing when it came out by where I live... I was disappointed that they did not offer free comic books like they did with the first X-Movie.This movie ripped! Great story, good continuity between the first movie and this one. Excellent depiction of characters. Worth the 3 year wait. And... They actually gave Halle Berry some speaking lines.I like how Famke Janssen looks here, better than the first movie (or the last, but the last there is a reason for how she looks). My favourite thing about this film was the way Nightcrawler was shown, and the way he was filmed teleporting was exactly how I imagined it when I used to read X-Calibur (The comic series where Nightcrawler spent most of his time).Although I saw this twice in the theatre, I did not really recognise the ""Pheonix Saga"" until I saw X-3 and they brought out that part of the story.What this story deals with is mostly Wolverine's past. They changed the ""Lady DeathStrike"" character just a bit, and I have to say I like the revision.I think this film was the director's masterpiece, not really having been impressed by Superman Returns, I feel he is a traitor to Marvel for leaving the franchise and going off to DC-land.Since the first X-Men movie came out, each subsequent Marvel movie has exceeded the quality of the previous one.Looking forward to The new Hulk... And too bad Eric Bana is no longer Banner!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","jerekra","25 February 2009","FOr the most part I thought the first X Men film was OK. I thought there could have been more action and a little more character development. I think that ""X 2"" did a little better at character development and had a little more action.Wolverine is in this film about as much as the first film. I guess he is the most popular X Men member so he gets the most screen time. Wolverine does get in some more solid action in this film but I wonder with how much he is in these X Men films how much more they can show in the upcoming Wolverine film.Mystique is in this film a lot. She really is pretty important to the film. It is kind of cool how she is completely naked other than having some sharp patches on her and being blue. Magneto is kind of on both sides in this film as far as being both a good guy and a bad guy.I was hoping to see a lot of my two favorite X Men, Colossus and Ice Man. Colossus was awesome as he gets a brief scene where he attacks some guys who break into the X Mansion but that is it. He does not show up really at all after that scene. Ice Man is in this film a marginal amount and he got to show some dramatic scenes where he expresses his love for Rogue as well as how he tells his family that he is a mutant. But I was disappointed with how little he used his abilities. Could have been ""cooler"" but at least he was a developed character.Jean Gray is pretty cool in this film also. Storm was OK, but I do not know something seems to be missing with her character. I also liked Nightcrawler and he is very important to the film and is developed correctly. Cyclops once again did not seem as cool as he was in the comics and does not get to do that much.I think the film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. It has pretty good flow and there is a lot happening. But there is a lot of good action about a half hour into the film in the X Mansion scene but that is the best action part of the film. THere are other action scenes but nothing as good as that part so after the X Mansion scene there is nothing as good as that. I expected a better final showdown at the end of this film against Magneto, better than the one in the first film but there was NO SHOWDOWN with Magneto in this film. The ending I thought was kind of boring.THere could have been more action but what they had was pretty good, not great. THey do a good job with certain characters portrayal though and that is a big improvement from the first film. A little better than the first one but still has some flaws. I recommend it over the first one.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","IPyaarCinema","1 March 2021","Review By Kamal KThis sequel is bigger, badder, and better than the first film, bringing back the excellent special effects, attractive stars, and fun action sequences, and the perfect popcorn-movie tone. That said, while this movie is all about the action, there are so many characters that it's hard to include them all in anything meaningful, giving parts of X2: X-Men United the feel of a prolonged introductionThe comic's fans want to see every character up on the screen, and the movie tries to make it happen. But the result is that it's hard for people who are not familiar with the stories to keep everyone straight or develop much of a commitment to any of them. Halle Berry and Anna Paquin in particular are still criminally underused. The most memorable character is Mystique, played by Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, who is so good that she can even act under all that blue paint and thosesequin-like scales. Alan Cummings is a welcome addition as Nightcrawler, but his German accent and Biblical references seem out of place and attracted some laughter from the audience. This is handled with more sensitivity in the comic books, where he is portrayed as a devout Catholic.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","harry_tk_yung","3 May 2003","SpoilersSince the release of X-men in 2000, quite a few of the members in the original cast have attained more prominent recognition, although not yet comparable to the status eventually reached by the cast of The Magnificent Seven. Halle Berry (Storm) an Oscar, albeit undeservedly. Ian McKellen (Magneto) gained worldwide recognition from his portrayal of Gandalf in Lord of The Rings. Rebecca Romijn-Syamos (Mystique) has made her mark in her alluring double role in Femme Fatale. Anna Paquin (Rouge) got considerable exposure, albeit in supporting role, in Almost Famous and Finding Forester (even if her achievement in ""The piano"" might have been forgotten).The discarded duo of Toad and Sabretooth from X-1 is amply replenished in X-2. Of the newcomers, I particularly like Nightcrawler, with his fascinating persona of religious good guy cum exotic outsider. Visually, he makes a perfect pair with Mystique, for obvious reasons. Most stunning is the visual interpretation of his teleporting feats, fruit of a perfect marriage of creative imagination and superb techonology.The new pair of Fire and Ice gets only an introductory exposure but will obviously fuel the main plot in X-3. In conjunction, Rouge gets disappointingly little screen time, particularly in comparison with the key role she had in X-1. Disappointing it may be, the strategy is understandable. The new teenage triangle is to be saved for X-3 while in the meantime, the old triangle of Wolverine, Jean and Cyclops has to be sorted out first in X-2.Somewhat wasted is black belt holder Kelly Hu's Yuriko. Again the strategy is clear. Yuriko is introduced specifically as a villain in X-2 and is not going to stay around as a member of the mutants. Therefore, it would not be cost-efficient to devote any footage to developing her character, particularly when there are already too many characters to cover.As the temporary alliance with Magneto ends, we can look forward to resumption of the good old confrontation in X-3. Wolverine will likely continue to be the central character but as the attraction in the searach for his origin is beginning to wear thin, new elements may need to be brought in. Dr. Jean Grey did not really die, as comic fans told me, and will come back. Cyclops however may receive even less attention in X-3 than the pitiably little coverage he has in X-2. As mentioned, the teenage triangle will take a more prominent position. The fate of Nightcrawler, together with that of the earlier members, still remains to be seen. Magneto's camp needs some reinforcement in addition to the fiery guy he just picked up. Hopefully, there will be some wonderful new surprises.As to X-2, it delivers what I purchased my admission ticket for. In addition to the teleporting I mentioned, there are two things I particularly enjoyed, and they both come from Magneto. The idea of infusing the jailer's blood with an overdose of iron for Magneto to manipulate is ingenious. Annihilating a whole group of soldiers by simply removing the safety pins in their grenades via magnetic influence is also pretty clever. Great fun. Marvellous movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tributarystu","10 May 2003","This movie was, in a way, an adventure for me. I did prepare for it, I really did! I re-watched X-Men, twice even, I asked around about the movie, etc. Had real pleasure working. As a sequel, one might expect less from this than from the original. I had high hopes that it would exceed the original, as that one was more or less a mediocre movie. Maybe it wasn't mediocre, but it left me a feeling of unhappiness. Sadly, this one has too but still, it's quite a difference between these ""tastes"".SPOILERSSo we've all seen the movie, it's good and all that stuff, but for the beginning I've got a question which bothers me day and night(actually it bothered me only for 5 minutes after the movie): why did Dr. Gray have to ""die"" ?(if she did die...fact which I doubt, despite having no info on the comic books) It makes little sense for me. ""She made a choice""...come on! Which was this choice? Did it regard the two ""contenders""? Well, it'll remain a mystery for the time. This is one of the less logic things in the film. For me, as a non-comic book reader, at least. The movie makes a great impression on the whole, but if you really look in detail at it you notice something which might bother you: it's simple and, though well masked, predictable. It doesn't shock you, yet it thrills you, it doesn't amaze you, yet it makes you feel good. This might be the thing which made me feel a huge gap between what I wanted and what I saw in X-Men.The characters are only interesting because they are funny. Not really complex, I'd say. Wolverine is made a fool of and I remain unsure whether he is or he isn't intellectually ""equipped"". Dr. Gray is my mystery. You could see from a million miles away what kind of a person Pyro was and what he was going to do. The romantic couple lacks true romance. In a way it's quite interesting: the ""flaming"" kiss can only exist with ice. Strange way to look at it. Yet, they have no sense of measure.On the big, big whole it is, as I've said, a good movie. It's good action, tense and something's always ""cooking"". I personally liked circus man, Kurt Wagner, the most as he did have not only a great skill, but also an interesting character. I only wonder: why does he believe? There's not backing up to his beliefs. Yet, I'm on his side. 8/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","gigan-92","13 May 2009","Bryan Singer really proves himself here, bringing us possibly the GREATEST superhero film ever. If you loved the first film, this one will exceed your expectations and beyond!! I'll begin with the incredible story, which will involve audiences throughout, done by Zak Penn thankfully. This time around much more screen time is devoted to personalization these characters and Singer makes sure each one gets their adequate amount of screen time.The cast is fantastic I must say. We have all the actors from the previous film, plus several new and thrilling characters. Night Crawler, played by Alan Cumming, is no doubt my favorite of them. Aaron Stanford is Pyro, another character well done. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine perfectly, creating a sense of mystery with the mutant. The action is mind blowing, no less than awe-inspiring. From the White House assassination attempt to Pyro's firery attack against the police, all the scenes are unique and have an intensity only Singer could deliver. Which reminds me, Kelly Hu is sexy as Lady Death Strike and the fight between her and Wolverine is by far one of the best action sequences ever filmed.Singer sets up a dark atmosphere of conflict, not too unlike our own discrimination and hate-filled world. It is this major component that shows that only through unity can intolerance be defeated, the movie's definite theme. To add to this film's greatness, John Ottoman's score is incredible, if not one of his very best. It definitely keeps the mood of the film, whether heroic, tormented, or tragic. Single handedly one of the best hero flicks ever filmed.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","kyle-medina","30 March 2012","This is one of the better films in the Xmen series.The first film was a bit muddled with so many new characters, to the non-fanboy populace, and in plot details. Although the film was a massive success, it was difficult for many moviegoers uninitiated in the X-Men saga. But in ""X2: X-Men United,"" there's a greater degree of cohesiveness. We have a clear and present evil, a solid storyline, and loads of characters to gawk at. There's also a better pace to this film. It's more organized and the action sequences are evenly placed in the movie. I kept waiting and waiting for Deathstrike to unsheathe her claws, and when she finally did, it was thoroughly satisfying. Her and Wolverine's fight scene was incredible! Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is more complicated, feral, and downright vicious in this film and I like it. When he begins his berserker rage in the school, I couldn't help say, ""Wow."" Without his performance, the movie goes nowhere. He is such a hinge for the film. Alan Cumming was awesome as my favorite X-Man growing up, Nightcrawler. He has always been so complicated and enigmatic, and this movie gave us just enough to understand him, but not enough to discard him with boredom. The attack on the president scene was better than I could have ever imagined. Much like Spider-Man, I always had an idea about how Kurt would move, teleporting from here to there, the acrobatics, the ""bamf"" and the cloud of brimstone: one word- amazing!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Tweekums","16 November 2008","I enjoyed the original X-Men film so looked forward to seeing the second in the series, I was not disappointed. All of the mutants who survived the first film are back in this one along with a few new ones, most notably Nightcrawler, played by Alan Cumming who we first see as he enters the White House and appears to make an attempt on the presidents life.This attack is used as an excuse to raid Professor Xavier's school by General Stryker (Brian Cox). Simultaneously he captures the Professor and Cyclops while they are visiting Magneto in his plastic prison and Storm and Jean are attempting to find the mutant who attacked the president. Luckily Stryker's team don't manage to capture all of the people at the school, several including Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman and Pyro escape. These four head to Boston to meet up with Storm and Jean, before meeting them however they end up in a confrontation with the police that could make matters worse for the mutants. While all this has being going on Magneto has escaped from prison with the help of his shape-shifting sidekick Mystique.Given the threat posed to mutant kind by Stryker the remaining X-Men form an unlikely alliance with Magneto so they can free the Professor before he is tricked into doing Stryker's dirty work for him.As with the previous film the acting, direction and special effects are very good, if anything the characters are better, I found Nightcrawler to be more interesting than the two mutants that were killed off in the first film and Brian Cox was impressive as General Stryker. If you haven't seen the original film I'd advise you watch it first as it introduces most of the characters and explains what skills they each have.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","dr_foreman","7 May 2003","Everyone seems to think that X2 is superior to its predecessor, merely on the account of its larger budget.How unimaginative and superficial we've all become.  X2 is a bloated, noisy, action-oriented sequel to a more thoughtful, far superior film.  Special effects aside, everything about X2 is weaker.  The massive cast prevents sufficient character development, the film is edited like an MTV video, and the plot meanders terribly.The most interesting characters from the first film - Rogue and Magneto - are sidelined here.  Ian McKellan is wasted in a minor role, and suddenly his morally ambiguous character - who was so fascinating in the first X-Men - is just evil, to the point where he taunts Rogue after having tortured her, and advocates the total destruction of humanity.  Rogue, meanwhile, gets to have a poorly developed romance with Iceman - every bit as thin and unconvincing as Wolverine's romance with Jean Grey.  Why bother hiring such talented actors as McKellan and Paquin if they must take a back seat to digital trickery and junior high school-caliber ""romance""?Alan Cumming makes a terrible Nightcrawler (I can do a better German accent - ""my name eez Kurt Vagner,"" indeed!), and Halle Berry is once again a totally flat Storm.  Brian Cox makes a cheesy villain (his name is Striker, for goodness' sake!), and his human troops are so outmatched by the mutants that he never provides a credible threat.  In fact, the conflict is so imbalanced that I have to root for humanity - we're going to get our backsides kicked!On the plus side...well, I liked Jean Grey, and Magneto's escape, but they weren't worth the ten bucks.  Here's hoping that X3 gets its budget lowered, so it might turn out smarter than this soulless, cash-powered clunker.","

The movie has many mutants but there are no boring characters, every character has interesting points. It's not easy to put so many X-Men superheroes in one movie and still maintain the story. But this movie did that. The point that makes me a bit puzzled is that Bryan turned Mystique and Nightcrawler into two strangers, ignoring the uncanny similarity in their skin color. The action scenes are beautiful and very entertaining. My only regret would have been the further emotional climax at the end. I wanted a more epic and painful battle than that.","

The first movie a big part of the story was just establishing all of the characters so this movie has the advantage over that in everything is already in a groove without having to spend a good chunk of the movie just explaining everyones character background. Last Stand had so many flaws there's not enough time to explain them.The movie having good additions to the cast with Brian Cox as William Stryker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike and Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler were both positive additions.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","RealLiveClaude","10 May 2003","I just saw the first X-Men a few weeks before I saw X2 in the theaters. I liked the first one, especially Wolverine. Hugh Jackman is sure a great actor to portray such a hellraiser like this Canadian Mutant.X2 remains in the same category: tense, action-filled and of course a couple of twists to keep the spectator at the edge of the seat. Wolverine (Jackman) stills rules, but the movie belongs here to Professor Xavier (excellent Patrick Stewart, I should start seeing Star Trek Next Generation...), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, a good versatile actor, who also played in another comic book adaptation 2 years ago with one of my faves: Rachael Leigh Cook...) and Dr.Jean Grey (Famke Jansen is excellent, and gorgeous...). I was not very much impressed with Stryker, but Magneto still is more powerful, even if he stops being a villain for a while to save his race...I admit there is a strong message again about intolerance of all kinds in this world. A reflection of our fear of the unknown. But the Mutants knows no fear... And it shows (minor spoiler) when Dr.Gray does a desperate thing to save her colleagues... Like Professor Xavier said: She made her choice... And not only between Cyclops and Wolverine, but about something else...Go see that movie. An excellent 2 hours well spent...","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","rparham","5 June 2006","After the box-office success of X-Men in 2000, revitalizing the comic book film genre that had fallen on hard times after Batman & Robin successfully chased audiences away, it was inevitable that the X-Men would return in a sequel, and that is precisely what happened with 2003's X2. Director Bryan Singer was back on board, supported by many of the key creatives that ushered X-Men to the screen, and in the process crafted a sequel that was stronger than the original.X2 opens some time after the conclusion of X-Men, with Magneto (Ian McKellan) held in a plastic prison after attempting to mutate the world leaders on Ellis Island, and things back to semi-normal at the Xavier School for Gifted Children. But things don't last that way for long: there is an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a mutant, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) which gives General William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military official running a special mutant research and development wing of the military, license to crack down on mutants, including raiding the Xavier School.Meanwhile, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), has gone searching for some answers to questions about his past, but found very little. Returning to the fold of the X-Men, he goes on the run with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) when Stryker attacks. Stryker kidnaps Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and plans to use his telepathic abilities to destroy all mutants across the globe. Into this fray, Magneto, aided by his shapeshifting associate Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos), escapes, meets up with the still free X-Men and the two groups plan to join forces to assault Stryker's base and stop him from carrying out his plan.X2 takes most of what was good about X-Men and serves it up again in a much better package. X2 has a noticeably bigger budget, and while impressive special effects are rarely the sole reason to see a movie, when the film calls for it, they help immeasurably. Still, as with X-Men, Singer and company know when to hold back, and X2 is not ruled by it's visuals. Again, the material at the film's heart takes center stage, and this time the combination proves much more compelling.Essentially, X2 naturally steps up the first film, pushing the plight of the X-Men to the next level and further developing the obvious rift that exists between normal humans and mutants. The film is helped by the introduction of Stryker, a good villain who, while certainly appropriately evil, isn't without his shades of grey. He is a man driven by some dark demons, and while the lengths he goes to are extreme, they are not without some basis in the character's development.X2 once again falls a little short in one area: character management. The X-Men are a group of characters that have been around a long time and there are so many that it becomes difficult to introduce new ones and not begin overcrowding the film. Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter manage to balance it most of the time, but still you can't help feeling that some of the X-Men are coming up short on screen time and development, robbing the film of some of it's emotional power. When the characters are borderline strangers to you, it is difficult to really feel something for their plight.One strong point about X2 that improves over the original is the music score. John Ottman's entry is much more memorable and energetic than Michael Kamen's good, but at times restrained score for the first film. The actors are all in good form, with Hugh Jackman proving to be perfect casting again as curmudgeonly loner Wolverine, and Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart always bring touches of class to the material. Brian Cox is good as the maniacal Stryker and Alan Cumming proves memorable as Nightcrawler.So, X2 proves to be that rarest of beasts: a sequel that is actually better than it's original. X-Men was a proving ground that led the creators to push the boundaries on the sequel and make appropriate improvements when necessary. It's too bad all filmmakers didn't follow their example.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ForTheMostPart1999","8 November 2022","A more detailed and engaging plot and a rather epic and smash ending, especially when comparing it to the first film. Good fight scenes, better action, and the usual subtle humor (a lot more subtle compared to Marvel Avengers films, interestingly). The X-Men group together again with Magneto and Mystique helping out for the first time. Will the two ever officially be apart of them? As expected, they're not just on another rescue mission, but a mission that could potentially save their growing species as well as humanity's. I could almost add another 1/2 to this rating for the usual good sequel achievement. What happened to Magneto is certainly one question that remains.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","chvylvr80","5 May 2003","X2 has everything that X Men lacked. Most notably this is more screen time and fight scenes for Wolverine. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and I can't see anyone else in the role. Nightcrawler is the coolest mutant (except for Wolverine) introduced so far and his teleportation ability is visually dazzling and helps him do things no other mutant can. Colossus's cameo is cool but he should have been given more scenes. Hopefully in X3 he will be given more. My only complaint is that the film runs a bit long and drags in some spots. A few cuts would have kept this movie tighter and more concise. The effects in this movie are spectacular and are one of the movie's greatest strengths. I hope that the X Men films just keep getting better. Bottom Line: This is a must see in the theater. You have to see it on the big screen and then do your duty as an American and buy it on DVD.","

I must admit that the first time I saw this film I wasn't very impressed. I did enjoy the special effects, but had hoped to see the Sentinels in this film. After watching the film a second time I rather enjoyed the flow of the story. This movie finds Wolverine starting to become more and more a part of the team. It does do a little background into the Weapon X program, but it really stands out by humanizing the characters that we all know as ""super-heroes."" I was also happy to see some of the characters get to shine by using their powers a little more than the first movie. I was very happy with this film.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Howlin Wolf","20 July 2005","... which the sequel then junked for the usual silly superhero theatrics and vapid set-pieces. Some people criticised X-Men because they thought it didn't have enough action - I liked that it focused more on 'dialogue' and 'mood'... X2 went too far in the opposite direction, for my liking. To put it into perspective, I also liked ""The Hulk"" for the same reasons most people hated it... ! The first installment was duty-bound to do sterling work establishing the players and examining their various back-stories. For the most part that isn't necessary here, and so I felt that it just wasn't dealt with satisfactorily AT ALL - even for party newcomers like Nightcrawler. Any trace of subtlety is pretty much swamped by the traditional gung-ho heroism now that the majority of the group know each other better.The many interesting relationships of the first (such as that between Wolverine and Rogue) are not given anywhere near the attention they deserve in order to cram in more physically astonishing feats. Your average teenage moviegoer will love this (as proved by the high rating here) but I've seen it all before; and to see the series regress to aping countless other summer blockbusters when it began by celebrating differences, (literally) was more than a little dispiriting to experience...","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","garethvk","1 May 2003","The 2003 summer movie season is upon us with the release of X2 the highly anticipated follow up the 150 Million plus grossing `X-Men'. The film continues the story of a band of genetic mutants known as The X-Men who find themselves battling a fearful and mistrusting society as well as fellow mutants for better understanding of their kind as well as their very survival. Based on the hit Marvel comic series, the film directed by Bryan Singer, `X2' revolves around an attempt by Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox), to eliminate the mutant threat by invading the training school and home of the X-Men and their leader Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). This direct attack on the mutants adds fuel to the fire as Charles's old friend yet recent enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen), now has proof to his long standing theory that mutants must fight the humans for survival. Until now, Xavier has always believed that humans and mutants could co-exist in peace and has trained his students in this philosophy as well as the enhancement of their talents. Magneto has always believed that mutants must fight to survive, and that humans are inferior and has surrounded himself with followers who share this belief.  Naturally this conflict of interest has lead to skirmishes between the two sides as well as an increased fear of mutants from a human population caught in the crossfire.  As if the attack on the academy was not enough to complicate the lives of the X-Men, Magneto has escaped from his high security prison and a mutant assassin has made an attempt on the life of the President making a tense situation even more volatile as fear and paranoia regarding mutants is now at an all time high. Faced with a battle on several fronts, the X-Men join forces with Magneto's troops in a reluctant alliance that is necessary for the survival of their kind as well as for the very human race.What follows is a dazzling mix of special effects and action as the two sides battle Stryker's legions and each other with the very real threat of genocide hanging in the balance. There are some fine performances in the film especially those of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the shape shifting Mystique and that of Alan Cumming as the Bible quoting teleporter Nightshade. The two characters add energy and humor to their roles that makes them stand out from the majority of the cast save Hugh Jackman's standout performance as Wolverine.This is a much more serious X-Men than the last adventure as people are killed along the way upping the violence from the traditional comic book style yet none of it is overly explicit. My biggest gripe with the film was that there were several long gapes in the film where little was happening and that talents such as Hale Berry, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Ian McKellen were not given much to do with the screen time they had. There were flashes of great moments such as Roque (Ana Paquin), confronting Magneto for the first time since he tried to kill her in the last film, and a bizarre love triangle involving Wolverine that has to be seen to be believed, yet as a whole, `X2' left me wanting more. I know with so many characters in the story it would be difficult to develop them all, and `X2' does a nice job expanding on the roles of some of the smaller characters from the comic and past film, yet it simply does not add up. I think that with a tighter script and more attention to the details this film would have been truly great. That being said, `X2' is an entertaining summer film that should delight fans of the past film and the comic. If you can get by a few plot holes, then you might find yourself having a good time.3 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Angelus2","5 February 2008","I've decided to re-comment on this movie as I for some reason unknown to me, decided to sit down and watch it all over again.This surpasses the first film and explores other characters; Bryan Singer does his best to stay close to the comics but there are big errors....Yet this movie still thrills a hardcore fan....Just about...This film carries on after the first, Magneto is in his plastic prison and is regularly visited by General Stryker who has a way to make mutants co-operate...Brainwashing them with a serum. Rogue is now dating Bobby the Iceman while Jean is having troubles with her power and Cyclops feels unloved. And Wolverine returns from his 'soul-searching' adventure to find out a mutant has attacked the President. With the Jean, Storm, Cyclops and Charles Xavier away and Wolverine babysitting the mansion is attacked by the US Government.Now Wolverine is thrown in a 'unwanted' role as a leader and protector, he slices and dices through the intruders and rescues a few....And now its time to face the past and make a new future...I loved Wolverines berserker rage as he unleashes hell on the soldiers that decide to walk into his house and threaten his 'family'...I loved Hugh Jackman's fight scenes at second glance. On second glance I found many things endearing, like Jean and Cyclops deteriorating relationship, Nightcrawler's scenes especially his own self-introduction, the bonding scenes with Storm and Nightcrawler; but something I found very sad was the use of Cyclops, loved his fight scene but then he gets cut out, he should have been given a more pivotal role and Lady Deathstrike should been a main villain.All in all a nice comic book movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","WasiReviews","6 September 2020","The all-star cast enters again with a great sequel that talks about the same social problem of mutants vs. humans. That is not nearly as annoying as X-Men the Last Stand. The setting is the best part, Hugh Jackman is the main character as always with a bad*** suit. The whole first act is an awesome spectacle watching Magneto break out of jail (that's not a spoiler), Professor X and all the rest get more screen-time. I really feel that Wolverine's arc about finding out about his past in the three year gap between films was wasted. Rouge is easily the second best character for me she's really hot, Anna Paquin plays the character well just like the previous film. The whole dynamic with the younger X-men was interesting and made it stand out from the other superhero movies of this time period. The second act takes us to the dam and we spend the rest of the movie getting epic fight scenes, good philosophy, vengeance and fun.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","mentalcritic","30 April 2003","Considering what happened with the Batman series, particularly after Tim Burton left, and considering what has happened in plenty other comic book adaptations such as Spider-Man or Daredevil, nobody would be blamed for having bet that an X-Men sequel would be a disaster. But X2: X-Men United, as it is billed here, is a sequel that can be mentioned in the same breath as Aliens or The Godfather Part II.Like the original, this new sequel has something to say about how our society deals with people who don't look the same, act the same, think the same, or feel the same as all the drones out there. The spirit of the comic books it is based on is very much alive in this film, and that's a big part of what makes it such compelling viewing. In today's society, people with a serious mental illness will be rooting for characters like Wolverine, or Magneto if they have a sadistic side, all the way. In tomorrow's society it could be people who undergo genetic engineering to rid themselves of cancer or other horrible diseases. Who knows? That's the truly sad part of these stories - they only seem to either stay relevant or get more relevant as time goes on.Ian McKellen is in fine, fine form as Magneto, the angry mutant whose justification for waging war on ""normal"" society is all but handed to him on a platter in this episode. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos actually gets to do something other than sit there and look pretty this time, and Halle Berry proves once again that she cannot act her way out of a wet paper bag. But once again, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin steal the show, in spite of the latter having a significantly reduced role compared to the first film. Shawn Ashmore also squeezes his head in and manages to prove he is there for a reason, too.Unlike the original X-Men, in which the true bad guys are mostly undefined except for a rather nasty Senator, one will not be able to walk out of X2 without pathologically hating the bad guys here. Brian Cox plays the mad general so well that anyone with a truly compassionate bone in their body will want to leap into the picture and tear the head off the kind of man who could do THAT to his own son. And the film is all the stronger for it, because it brings the message that the normalists who would give us all gene tests when deciding who should live or die are the real bad guys, not the mutants who have been made bitter and angry by their behaviour. I know a whole family of utter creeps who would do well to be nailed into a chair and forced to watch this film with their eyes pried open, Ludivico-style.I won't say anything about the ending except for two small points. One is that it makes Ray Park's line in the first film (""Don't you people ever die?"") seem all the funnier, except it really isn't the sort of point where one should laugh. I did, but that is just the kind of person I am. The other is that it proves anyone in this film can out-act Halle Berry, even another former Bond girl, in this case Famke Janssen. She gives the film an end-sequence of the kind that I've only seen in other films like Gladiator and Rollerball (the real Rollerball, I mean).To summarise, out of 125 minutes of near perfection, I have only three minor complaints. The editing of the final battle sequence, particularly when Patrick Stewart is in the new Cerebro, is a little too loose for my liking. Parts seem to have been repeated just to stretch out the running time. I also found Nightcrawler's constant prayer recitals annoying. If this was supposed to enforce the idea of Christian good guys, it doesn't work because we've seen before how their kind are little different from the William Stryker caste. Lastly, they really should have got someone other than Halle Berry to play Storm. I don't care who, just anyone. She is the biggest personality vortex I have ever seen on the big screen, and I kept expecting Anna Paquin to turn to her and say ""I *earned* my Oscar"".But at the end of the day, I wish all sequels could be as good as this effort. Ten out of ten from me. It did lose a point because of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but it gains it back (and then some) whenever Hugh Jackman or Anna Paquin say something. Those two should work together more often.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","pulikd","22 December 2023","There clearly is more material here than in the previous film. It raises the stakes and explores some of the main characters' histories. The visuals are also stronger. What's clearly weaker than the last time is the music. Beyond the opening and the ending credits, there isn't much to speak of. In general, of course, ""X2"" from 2003 is ""more"" than ""X-MEN"" from 2000. But more does not necessarily mean better. Piecing all the elements together here isn't as careful as the last time, and even though the runtime is longer, the movie seems to be struggling to keep it all together. The editing may have something to do with that. But again, as for the good things, it is a sequel that follows in the original's footsteps. That alone can be viewed as a luxury a couple of decades after ""X2"" was released. It looks better than the first one. The sounds, however, don't beat the first one. The contents have more but could have been organized better. A good sequel, for sure, but whether it is better than the original can be rightfully questioned. And a good piece of entertainment that, again, is not all fun but also matters of life and death.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","fedor8","16 October 2007","This near-feminist weak sequel to the rather average first installment left me in tears... of boredom and laughter. The two don't normally go hand-in-hand, but the impossible CAN happen. The impossible (or shall I say absurd) as in Stewart having such enormous powers that he can kill all mankind with thought alone. Wow. How bombastic can you get. But the really silly bit is that this all-powerful Stewart - realistically speaking powerful enough to be mistaken for God - is so easily manipulated to do things against his will, such as kill all humans. So the merry band of X-Women had to prevent ALL of mankind getting annihilated. Even James Bond's missions don't get this silly.It seems that nearly everyone's powers have quadrupled, at the very least, since the first movie. (I was even half-expecting the U.S. President to turn someone to stone or spew fire out of his ears.) Especially the female cast, which dominates here. But I guess in the laughable ""girl power"" (or ""fashion-model power"") age that we live in, what with all the Kill Bills, Death-Proofs, Ripleys, and other Lara Crofts, I should have by now gotten used to the fact that anorexic 6-foot super-models save entire galaxies in adventure films. (Just how do you get the energy to kill so many evil guys while boycotting food, i.e. starving?? I don't get it...) It is just sooooo convincing to watch an Uma Thurman chop-sokey 70 Japanese martial arts experts in one evening. It makes Bugs Bunny cartoons look like ""Les Miserables"".I'm all for wild fantasy, but there are limits as to how dumb an action movie can get before it becomes a parody of itself.Given the tremendous powers that Xavier and his goodie-two-shoes ""mutants"" have, how can the U.S. military, or for that matter, ALL of the world's military powers combined, do them any harm? Comic-book kiddy rubbish or not - that cannot be an all-purpose excuse here - even fantasy has to adhere to some form of logic and common-sense, especially the kind of fantasy that tries to make ""relevant"" political and social comments, thinly disguised in ""mutant"" (uni)form.Apart from the ridiculous premise, we also have some Latin soap-opera romance going, in the form of a love-triangle (Wolverine, Cyclops & Jean Grey), and even puppy-love (Rogue and Iceman; I feel so silly even writing these names down...). Hence it's no wonder that the movie overstretches its welcome by at least 40 minutes, what with its whopping 130 minutes running time. There is very little going on in the first half-hour, which was particularly dull. The love-triangle implodes when Famke Janssen dies at the end. Was this supposed to be a touching/emotional moment? I yawned. Just check out Jackman's/Wolverine's unconvincing sobbing; but, hey, it's tough to act when you're in front of a damn blue screen all the time. And I guess in the third part we'll have Wolverine falling in love with Cyclops, right? Maybe as a little nod of approval to the gay community... And the less said about all those mutant kids being in the movie, the better... Dull props, nothing more.One of the dumbest things in this lame sequel is Alan Cummings. He would have been bad enough in any human role here, but as a mutant? And a German mutant?? A German, Christian-fanatic mutant??? Cummings' accent reminded me of Sascha Cohen's gay Austrian Bruno character from his Ali G show. Almost as bad is Mystique (what a dumb dumb dumb name), who is given the ol' switcheroo shtick, so very much milked dry in about half of all ""Star Trek"" episodes. So she can transform into anyone? With that power she doesn't need either ""God"" or Magneto (another dumb name) to rule the world - all by herself! This kind of nonsense may look good to nerdy zit-faced pre-teens when offered in comic-book form, but on the screen it's just all far too silly. As most Marvel film adaptations are. Still, it isn't nearly as bad as Ang Lee's ""Hulk""...I am really looking forward to seeing the sequel! In it, I expect to see our X-Women powerful enough to make the Sun circle the Earth, maybe Neptune and Jupiter will be smashed together as one, and maybe Famke Janssen will re-surface as a sort of quasi-goddess, who gets jealous of Wolverine and Cyclops for getting a gay marriage license. She will then join Magneto and destroy the whole universe. All of these powers are merely a result of ""human evolution"", of courseÂ I am really, really looking forward to the third part. I have a copy of it, I just need to place it in the DVD. But some magic power is preventing me from it... Could it be...? Could it be Magneto? Maybe he doesn't want me to trash his precious mutants in yet another, third, review...","

So the first half of the movie is to bring everything down. Once the whole lot is destroy, then they can come back to save the day. This time the bad guy is Stryker and even Magneto is there to join the fight. It's a perfectly fine follow-up.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Quinoa1984","27 May 2006","X2 was a movie I revisited before seeing the 3rd X-Men movie, and I'm reminded how director Bryan Singer, in one of his best films here, can have control, style and even moving artistry for this kind of popcorn entertainment he's now done with these two films (and will do soon with Superman perhaps) while still making it witty and dramatically engaging. That's not too common in a time when studios will gladly shill out pieces that have the painstaking (well, maybe not so much in 06) special effects and technical side to it while not having jack-s*** with the story and dialog.It helps with X2 that the actors are good professionals rising to the occasion and then some (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, even character-actor Brian Cox as Stryker brings real menace). And I liked how the relationships and/or trouble some of the characters are expanded upon with this story of a battle between the mutants and the darker forces at work. I could go on about the specific details of how certain action set-pieces are well done, or how the conflicts with the characters are proportioned well for their fates or personalities. But it comes down to something simpler- it's got that mix of a certain social attitude and relevance that isn't pushed too much into your face, just enough as the subtext for ""Hollywood"" appeal. Some scenes are more standout than others (Famke Janssen's plot line has the most relevance and depth, as her's is an unintentional 'to be continued'). Overall it's an exciting time, especially as a kind of nothing-to-do movie on the weekend- as are the others in the franchise. X2 is the kind of sequel, at the least for fans, that does have the appeal of trying to top itself from the first and not going into complete wastes of logic and style. A-","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","hitchcockthelegend","5 February 2011","X2 is directed by Bryan Singer who co-wrote the story with David Hayter & Zak Penn. The screenplay is jointly written by Hayter, Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, and the source material, Uncanny X-Men was by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. Cinematography is by Newton Thomas Sigel and the music score is provided by John Ottman; who also edits the film. The ensemble cast features amongst others, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Famke Jansen, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden and Kelly Hu. It is the sequel to the financial and critically successful X-Men released in 2000.Plot, in short, sees Colonel William Stryker (Cox) declare war on all mutants: especially the X-Men superhero group. This forces Xavier's (Stewart) army to do the unthinkable; join forces with arch enemy Magneto (McKellen). But there is many perils in the way, and some murky pasts and future decisions are about to be unleashed into the maelstrom.It has often been the source of much debate and musings, the old general feeling that sequels tend to be rubbish. While that is largely true as a whole, the niche that encompasses the superhero adaptation can rightly claim to have dispelled that argument in the last ten years or so. In fact many would argue that Superman II, Batman Returns & Blade II are better film's than the lead off picture that went before them, thus giving ""the superhero sequel is better"" debate more longevity of reference. Think Spiderman 2, The Dark Knight and, yes, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and it's good grounds to believe that the mention of a superhero sequel no longer brings apprehension and dread: but hope and a belief that directors can now improve on that first touchy feely franchise starter. Which is where X2 comes in, a film that is not only one of the best superhero sequels ever, it's also one of the best sequels ever, period.In the three year gap between the first film and this sequel, Singer has had time to broaden what was appealing in that first film, whilst also getting a longer running time and a bigger budget to do the job right. The end result is a film that in every department improves upon its predecessor. The returning characters, except for Marsden's Cyclops, get more depth and time on screen, and the new characters that come and join in the mÃªlÃ©e, also bring with them truly great rewards. None more so that Cumming's delightful teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, who gets to open the film up with a jaw-dropping sequence, that not only introduces us to a great new character, but also lets us know that Singer has mastered the art of shooting action. Yes it's that good. On the enemy side of things; Cox as Stryker is wickedly nasty and Kelly Hu's deliciously named Lady Deathstrike is a worthy opponent for Wolverine. Ah yes, Wolverine. As with the first film, Wolverine, beautifully essayed by the charismatic Jackman, is the core character thread. We like that he gets to kick more ass this time, that he is doing it with more back story, and in a state of anger and confusion, only serves to entertain more. Into the pot also goes the Junior X-Men, with Pyro (Aaron Sandford) & Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) joining Rogue (Paquin) for some mutant angst.There's a lot going on, but it's easy to follow and all the ingredients come together smartly. It's a credit to Singer and his writing team (and Ottman's editing) that even tho there's much in the pot it still feels lean and brisk, and, that continuity from the first film has been easily attained. The thematics have remained dark edged (hatred of minorities/alienation etc), but the film is not without humour either. While the effects are stylish and the set-pieces scintillating. Singer was saying during production that he felt The Empire Strikes Back was his marker for X2; that his film is worthy of being spoke of in the same sentence is the highest accolade we can give it. 9/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","zardoz-13","19 August 2016","""X-2: X-Men United"" ranks as an exemplary Marvel superhero epic with the cast from director Bryan Singer's superb first film ""X-Men"" reprising their respective roles. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), laser beams in his eyes Cyclops (James Marsden), as well as shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos); Iceman (Shawn Ashmore),; Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can hurl flames but needs a pilot light, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can take on aspects of the personalities around her. This above-average sequel carries on what Twentieth Century Fox charted in the initial breakthrough yarn. Nightcrawler (Alan Cummings) joins the action along with Brian Cox as the evil villain General William Stryker. Whereas Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) tangled with the renegade mastermind Magneto (Ian McKellen) in the first film, these two adversaries teamed up together to thwart an obnoxious government scientist, Stryker (Brian Cox), from butchering the world's mutant population. Stryker gets the White House on his side after Nightcrawler teleports himself into the Oval Office and Strkyer convinces the Chief Executive that they should monitor Xavier's school for gifted mutants.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","utgard14","31 May 2014","Fantastic sequel that is regarded by many as superior to the original. I don't particularly agree but rather than wade into that argument I'll just say that I love both movies. Where this movie is obviously stronger than the first is in its action scenes. It has some especially strong sequences, such as the opening Nightcrawler scene at the White House or the assault on the X-mansion. These scenes and others like them are much more cinematic and well-staged than the action scenes from the first movie.Most of the first movie's stars shine here as well. Jackman and McKellen lead the pack again. Janssen, Romijn, Berry, and even Marsden improve upon their roles from the first film. Also returning from the first film with a significantly larger part is Shawn Ashmore's Iceman. He's really good. New to the cast are Alan Cumming's wonderful turn as Nightcrawler, Aaron Stanford's enjoyable Pyro, Kelly Hu's sexy and deadly Lady Deathstrike, and Brian Cox lending some weight as the villainous human Stryker. There are also a slew of fan-pleasing cameo appearances from comic book characters such as Kitty Pryde, Siryn, and Colossus.Where the movie does suffer some is that, in adding the new characters and giving them a lot of focus, it takes away from some characters from the first movie that I liked a great deal. Patrick Stewart's Professor X is sidelined for a large part of this one. Anna Paquin's Rogue is stuck in a romantic subplot that gives her little to do for most of the film. Worse, her plot never goes anywhere. It's in the same place at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning. Sadly, things would get even worse for her character moving forward in the series. A crying shame considering how important she was to the first movie.Bryan Singer's direction is even more polished than the first movie. The script, while a little more involved than your average comic book film (at that time especially), is intelligent and full of memorable lines and scenes. The special effects are very good. The music is better than the first movie as well, although still lacking a definitive score like Batman or Superman had. Judged on its own merits or by comparison, it's a great movie. It's a shame that Singer didn't return for the third film. We all know how that turned out without him. At least when he did return with Days of Future Past, he brought back the old magic.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","vila_uk","18 April 2003","I was lucky enough to manage to get a ticket for a screening of X2 at London's Odeon Leicester Square at 10:00 am this morning.  I enjoyed the first film immensely but agreed that there were some flaws in it.  This film however totally blew me away.I was wondering how they would top the opening of the last film with its clever and dramatic retelling of the Magneto origin but I am pleased to say that they managed to provide a stunning and heart stopping sequence to open the film that will have fans and non fans gasping in delight.The film is superior in almost every aspect to the first.  All of the characters get extended screen time and seem more settled in their roles. Halle Berry has thankfully dropped the dodgy accent and left us with just a slight twang that works far better than her attempt in the first film.  We see a much more complex side to Storm than before and it works well. Hugh Jackman continues to develop what must be a very challenging role and manages to pull it off with a charm and flair that IS Wolverine.  He, as ever, gets pretty much the most screen time and we get to delve a little deeper into his past.  Alan Cumming's nightcrawker was something I had reservations of before I saw the film, but I can honestly say that he is fantastic.  Every scene he is in he steals and I nearly died of excitement the first time I heard a 'BAMF'.Famke Janssen is excellent in the film, her character Jean Grey is used very well indeed and fans will be pleased to see how Jean develops in this movie.The effects are superlative.  No dodgy glowing white balls of energy this time.  All powers are rendered superbly and are used very well indeed. The set pieces are mind-blowing and received rounds of applause in the cinema, something I am not used to seeing over here in Britain.  I can't wait to see this film again and it is a definite must for my DVD collection.  Now I only have to wait for the third instalment.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","CinemaSerf","28 November 2022","I think this is better than the first film though I still find Patrick Stewart's ""Picard""-in-a-chair character really irritating. Anyway, this time we have a good baddie in Scotsman Brian Cox (""Stryker""). He is a determined military man who manages to get the US President to give him carte blanche to take on and eliminate the mutants after a failed attempt to assassinate him in the White House. ""Magneto"" (Sir Ian McKellen), meantime, is still locked up in his plastic prison but his shape-shifting blue protegÃ© ""Mystique"" (Rebecca Romijn) concocts a cunning pan to free him; and just in time too! ""Stryker"" has discovered the existence of ""Cerebro"" and determined to control it, attacks the ""Xavier"" school neutralising many of the students and leaving only ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman),"" Scott"" (James Marsden) and ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin) to lead what's left of their team to extricate the now captured professor. Needs must, as they say, and an unlikely alliance forms with ""Magneto"", but will it hold and as we build to quite an exciting denouement, we realise that there is still plenty of scheming and plotting going on. Cox is not really a very versatile actor, but here he provides a solid fulcrum for a story that has plenty of action. There is much less emphasis on the moralising, hormonal, frat-style storyline of the 2000 version; the characters are older and better developed and can control, therefore use, their powers to more dramatic effect for those watching. The story is still a bit thinly predictable, but the visual effects team pull out all the stops keeping this 2Â¼ marathon moving along surprisingly effortlessly. I'm now very much in team ""Magneto"" - bring on X3!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","4 May 2009","I base this on the 2-Disc release. It has started, and it simply rocks. This whole thing builds on almost all of what the first set up and did, in so many ways, and in fact goes places only a follow-up could. Now that the world and the universe have been established, they could afford to do interesting stuff with what they had, and this the romance is just part of it. The new is also impeccable... the villain, the addition of Nightcrawler, so much is brought to the table with this, food for thought, complexity, dense, more than meets the eye. This is bigger than its predecessor, and without becoming pure fluff in the process. The action is grander, without being the main focus. The themes are the same, with a couple of different explorations of them this time around. The attention to detail is still amazing. The plot is well-done, nice script, very intriguing, and the pacing is spot-on, never standing still and not overwhelming, either. The nods to the comics are marvelous. The humor is well-done and fitting. The dialog is mostly good and well-delivered. The effects are incredible, and better than before. There are utterly stunning visuals in this. The fights are memorable and awesome. The ending of X-Men pays off majorly in this. This is quite dramatic. The orchestral score is fantastic. The powers are used well, such as the morphing(in this as well as the entry before it), and they look excellent. Production design is spectacular. The costumes, the tone in general remains true to the realistic approach. Cummings is well-cast, as well as Cox and Hu. The acting is, with few exceptions, invariably magnificent. There are strong women role models in this one, too. The problem of X1 has not been solved in this, in fact, if anything, it's made worse. There is an even greater amount of characters, and far from everyone gets to be developed in this. It does tend to work and there are fairly solid arcs in this. The abilities yet again have to be written around or out of the way entirely. These don't cost it a lot of points overall, I would say. There is relatively mild and infrequent language in this, and the sensuality is somewhat present, not necessarily strong. The DVD holds extras, including featurettes, interviews, behind-the-scenes stuff, extended/deleted scenes, plenty of galleries and two commentary tracks, one of Bryan Singer, and one of various crew-members, both well worth listening to. I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels, just watch the movie series from the 2000 film, and know that these translations, interpretations, not direct adaptations with everything accurate to the books. Those into science fiction ought to enjoy it, as well. And proof that sequels can match, and, arguably, surpass, the original, is always something to take note of. 9/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","DragoonKain","2 May 2003","The first X-Men film was a good movie, no doubt, but it was a very safe movie too.  Essential characters were introduced, the general premise was dealt out, and a little battle ensued at the end.  Now that we know the basics, it's time to really start the story.At least I hope that's what they plan to do.  For those new to it all: X-Men began in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  Back then comics were simpler, geared more towards kids.  Story lines took place over multiple comic books infrequently, and things generally set itself right by the end of the issue. In other words, for the most part, it was episodic.  But when Chris Claremont took over as writer in 1975, things really started to get interesting, and, I must admit, complicated.  I often wonder how much he had planned out in advance.  Suffice it to say, by the time the Pheonix Saga got underway in the late 70's, there was no turning back.  X-Men became a soap opera.  A very complex science fiction soap opera at that.  And it seemed to grow in complexity as it went on.  The stakes got higher, more and more characters came in replacing old ones, more X-issues were spun off eventually climaxing in what is possibly one of the best superhero comic arcs out there: The Age of Apocalypse (1995ish).  It probably should have ended after that, but it didn't.  But what a great 20 years of comic book writing that was.  I would have never thought it possible to capture its epicness on film.But with X-Men 2, it is clear that they have indeed upped the stakes.  The story is much bigger, the movie's much longer, there are many more characters, many more mini-plots, **spoiler **
and it ends with a cliffhanger!  (If you don't know what I mean, let me just say I think I saw a Pheonix rising right before the credits ran).  Needless to say I was thrilled, but also nervous.  Are they actually attempting the Pheonix Saga?  How far will they take it?  Will they actually have the wisdom to stop when it ends?  And more importantly, where will it end?  Most of the loose ends weren't tied up until 20 years (240 issues) later.
** end spoiler **The X-Men movies could be the greatest long running movie series in history, a pretty good trilogy, or a terrible disappointment.  If they manage to write a good long term story arc loosely based on the comics, and have the wisdom to stop the series when the story finishes, I'm sure Singer and most of the cast will see it through to its end.  To Hollywood I say the audience is hooked, our attention spans will last, don't worry about that.  Just don't give up the enthusiasm, and don't give up on these movies to soon.  I don't want this series to fade into mediocrity like Batman and Superman did.This movie had great action, great special effects, great characters, great character development, and an incredible plot.  But a plot that is only great in the context of its sequels and prequel.  This is a good thing. Many would consider this a bad thing, but those are probably people that didn't like ""The Two Towers"" because it didn't stand on its own.  The epicness of the story arc is what got me hooked on the comics in the first place.  We have longer attention spans than you think, hollywood.  I think 3 more movies should be enough.  And don't be afraid to surprise us comic fans either.Looking forward to X-Men 3.  Go see this movie!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Milla-M","10 May 2003","My older brother and his friend decided to go and see X-2 on Thursday night, since I had nothing better to do I decided to tag along (but believe me, I didn't go for the company). I think I was going to see this film at the weekend anyway as my friends were talking about it but I wasn't really excited about seeing it. I have seen the first X-Men and I thought it was fine and maybe a little overrated, my Dad, when he was little, was a big fan of the X-Men and he has a big dusty cardboard box filled with their old, mildewed comics. So one boring summer when I was up in the attic I had a little flick through them. I didn't know a lot about the X-Men but I discovered that I knew more than others. This is my first time reviewing a really big film still in the cinema, so don't mind me if I sound a little bit nervous at times, what with all your big, top quality reviews floating about.Anyways I'll start with the acting. They cast for this film is incredible and they really make this film just that bit more excellent. Some of the actors that really stand out are Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). Thank god Hugh Jackman was chosen to play Wolverine. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the feral gentleman, Jackman was excellent in the role, switching between berserker rage and gentle and dry. His relationship with Jean Grey is also quite intense, Jean Grey's character is wonderfully acted by Janssen, and this lady seems good at playing deeply troubled yet sophisticatedly sexy roles. Then McKellen and Stewart give an electric performance, the terse conversations, the familiar yet totally obscure relationship between them and their unsurpassed wisdom is excellently pulled off, together they're a wonderful combination. The rest of the acting is really good, I won't name all the actors but Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler), Halle Berry (Storm), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro) execute their roles perfectly, bringing the film to life to an even greater extent. I was also glad to see Romijn-Stamos' role exploited more, she plays Mystique brilliantly and her character seems much more human with much more character than before. Kelly Hu gave a great performance (if you can call it that) as the silent but deadly Deathstrike. I also liked the inclusion of some of the other, younger X-Men, Collosus, Siryn, Jubilee and Kitty Pryde (however I hope, if there is a sequel, they will have much MUCH more screen time).The film was basically story integrated with a lot of action. The action sent my already quivering spine shaking all over again. The opening sequence with an assassination attempt on the President's life played out with some excellent classical music was amazing. Other parts of the film such as the storming of the mansion, Mystique's invasion and Wolverine's cat (tiger) fight were all also astonishing action sequences. The dialogue in the film was quite good as well but it doesn't really stand out in a film with amazing special effects such as this. The special effects were delectable; they made the film seem much more realistic than it could've been. I especially liked Bobby Drake/Iceman's (Shawn Ashmore) mutant abilities as well as some others. Again I have to applaud Mystique as one of the most enjoyable characters in the film; her shape-shifting skills are brilliant to watch. The story wasn't as intelligent as the first X-Men's but I still enjoyed it, there weren't many heart-stopping twists in the storyline until near the end (of course I'm not going to tell youÂ), a real tendon-tweaking moment. A lot of the characters aren't fully explored either. I think the director should've tried to incorporate the use of flashbacks more often. I thought for a moment we might've delved deeper in Lady Deathstrike's past (when she starts to get all fidgety when she is with William Stryker and Professor X) or Pyro's past (when he sees all the Âhappy family' photographs on the wall in Bobby Drake's house), but we didn't. These characters were likeable characters but just weren't explored enough for me. Also I think Lady Deathstrike had a past with Wolverine right? This wasn't even touched on in the film, either. The theme of the story was colourfully highlighted. I think basically they were trying to display the intolerance of the human race, how we are always looking for a scapegoat and how people shouldn't be afraid to be themselves: - `Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know, look like everyone else.' - `Because we shouldn't have to.' Besides the lack of character development I found the pace was a bit off at times (this is very minor) and also that some things could've been explained a littler clearer but overall it was a brilliant film. Once I sat down in the cinema time just slipped through my hands like sand, I didn't even notice it go past. It was a truly brilliant film and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's an improvement upon the last film and I hope another sequel is made. I think the director (Bryan Singer) and the cast all deserve a round of applause. Watch this film; really, you won't forget it!Grade: A - Milla.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","JohnDeSando","24 April 2003","`X-Men 2,' the sequel to `X-Men,' is about as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.  Granted it may not have the cultural impact of the first ( a challenge for sequels, especially those adapted from comic books), and it may be too long by about a half hour, but there are intriguing themes like acceptance of differences (mutants) and the equality, maybe superiority, of women (Some of the most powerful mutant activity comes from women).Although the old `good versus evil' motif is a staple of most successful sci-fi, `X2' Director Bryan Singer (`X-Men,' `The Usual Suspects') has the good fortune of Brian Cox as the very evil William Stryker, dedicated to revenging himself on head mutant professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and destroying all mutants.  The government is determined to neutralize the mutants by putting forth the `Anti-Mutant Registration Act,' which would effectively eliminate any peaceful co-existence. The parallel with John Ashcroft's ambitious `rounding up all the usual Mid-Eastern suspects' comes immediately to mind.The special effects in `X2' are as good as the best out there, the minor women as smart and versatile as any `Avenger' or `Charlie's Angel' (for example, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mistique, the shape-shifter with a brain and a strong shape), but the leads are even more astounding.  Besides the always-interesting Stewart, Ian McKellan is the wicked but loveable Magneto, and Alan Cumming is the satanic teleporter, Nightcrawler. Even Anna Paquin in a thankless role as Rogue is able to establish a presence. Hugh Jackman as the irresponsible but attractive Wolverine should remain the audience favorite and the most human of the mutants.As our WCBE operations manager reminded me, casting plays a significant role in sci-fi flick success: Stewart and McKellan are the examples here. But more than their presence are the themes, the imagination, and the energy to make it all distinctively `X.' As always, the Bard says it best:

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","crowrobot","19 July 2005","Sequels are simultaneously the joy and the banality of Hollywood. They're fun because we see favorite characters again, and they're banal because all too often they repeat their predecessor. 'X2' is an improvement over the already good 'X-Men', and it's a great comic-book film.I prefer to leave plot details to writers, so let's get down to the cast. Hugh Jackman, I don't care what you say about his other movies, IS Wolverine. Every time I read the comic book now, I hear his voice. He's intense, animalistic, brutish, but he also has a sweeter side that too many action heroes don't have. Jackman pulls all of this off spectacularly, and I love him in this role. James Marsden is criminally underused, but he's not bad. Famke Janssen is oh-so-lovely as Jean Grey, and Halle Berry does a nice job as Storm. I liked Rogue (Anna Paquin), and her relationship with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is all the more heartbreaking because it's not forbidden love, it's a love that can never blossom. Patrick Stewart radiates authority as Xavier, as does Ian McKellen as Magneto. Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is sexy as Mystique, and I liked her ""real"" cameo (you'll know it when you see her).My favorite characters are the new ones: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a blue-skinned German teleporter who is deeply religious. Cumming pulls off the humor and pathos of his character well, and he has some nice scenes with Halle Berry. Kelly Hu does the silent killer thing as Lady Deathstrike. She, like Wolverine, has an adamantium skeleton and she has claws that come out of her fingernails. Wolverine's response? ""Holy sh**!"" That throwdown is a film highlight. Brian Cox is the villain of the piece, William Stryker, a man who wants revenge on all mutants. Cox exudes evil here, and he adds another fantastic notch to his belt. I also liked Aaron Stanford as Pyro, and I want to see more of him in the next movie.The special effects are bigger and badder this time around, and director Bryan Singer actually makes CGI look cool. The script gives everyone their moments in the sun, and the acting is great. 'X2' is yet another film in the steadily increasing line of great comic book movies.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","callanvass","20 January 2014","After Magneto has been imprisoned in an impregnable plastic chamber, the whitehouse is invaded by a mutant named ""The Nightcrawler"" His assassination attempt on the president goes awry. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to regain his memory to find out where he comes from. His former nemesis, William Stryker breaks into Prof. Xavier's school, while Magneto escapes with help from Mystique. It isn't very often that a sequel transcends it's predecessor, but X2 manages to not only surpass it, but in a huge way. Despite that the movie is over 130 minutes, it never feels overlong. As a matter of fact, it leaves you wanting more. It is completely exhilarating. The first X-Men was very exciting itself, but this one takes it up several notches. What I was most impressed about is how the story manages to be as strong as the astounding action (That plane sequence in the finale is incredible with Storm & Jean working their magic with their respective powers). I love action movies, but the action usually ends up making the film. The writers deserve all the credit in the world, along with Bryan Singer's amazing direction. It is a really multi-layered storyline. Despite that it was for selfish purposes, I got a kick out of seeing Magneto on the good guy side, and some characters that didn't get a chance to shine as much as I'd have liked in the first get to do so here, like Storm, Bobby, and a couple of others.Hugh Jackman is as wonderful as ever as Wolverine. His anti-hero routine never gets old. The love triangle between Logan, Jean & Scott continued even further. Patrick Stewart doesn't have much to do but succumb to Stryker's son, Jason. Ian McKellen is a treat to watch as Magneto. Not only he is menacing with his performance, but creepy at times as well. Halle Berry had a little more to play with in this film. I would have liked to seen even more, but i'm happy with what I got. Famke Janssen is beautiful in more ways than one. Her character would be elevated even further in X3: The Last Stand with her alter ego, Phoenix. Kelly Hu is certainly cool looking, even if her character doesn't have a lot of depth. That being said, she didn't need any depth. Her battle with Wolverine was impressive. Brian Cox is excellent as the cunning Stryker. I'm not sure why they didn't bring him back for Wolverine, but they should have. William Stryker's character has just as, if not bigger part in Wolverine. Alan Cumming adds intrigue with his Nighcrawler character. Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, James Mardsen (Fantastic emotional scene at the end) Aaron Stanford, Shawn Asmore all do what they have to do extremely well. Final Thoughts: This is one of the best superhero films you will ever see. It is up there with The Avengers, Spiderman II, Superman & Superman II. I consider X-Men to be a fantastic movie in its own right, but this one completely outdoes it. The action is completely exhilarating, the storyline is very engrossing, and it has plenty of great humor as well. I would have to call this film the complete package. It would take a big step back with the overblown X-Men III, sadly. 9.4/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","scoobyg69","3 May 2003","As one of the newest fans of X-Men, I was very excited for this film to be released.  I had only DISCOVERED the first film about 3 months ago, and was BLOWN away.  Last night, my wife and I attended the late showing and had the WORST MOVIE THEATER experience in our lives.  No air conditioning, noisy crowd, JAMMED seats, spilled concessions, and fat ladies in the row who wouldn't move for us.Well, in SPITE of our miserable experience, I must admit that X-MEN 2 was one of the BEST summer films in a few years.  This was not just a good film, this was an EXPERIENCE that movie magic is all about. 
Yes, there WERE a lot of characters to focus on, and in order to do that, some of our favorite characters from the first one were sacrificed for newer ones, but even the NEW characters were interresting enough that I could forgive the absence of a few others.  Cyclops got the worst screen time than anyone else, I actually MISSED him in this film.But in order to develope the new villian, story-lines, and character developements, I thought Brian Singer did OUTSTANDING and gave us MAGIC.Now, can I wait till the NEXT X-MEN?  I'll just have to see this one a few more times.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tomgillespie2002","25 May 2014","Seemingly using the first film to practice big-budget movie-making, Bryan Singer followed the mediocre X-Men (2000) with X2 (one of many dodgy titles attributed to the film), a balls-out, mutant mash-up full of genuine characters focus, an intriguing storyline, and set-pieces worthy of the money it earned. In fact, the opening scene, which depicts newcomer Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a mutant with a forked tail and the ability to teleport, attack a small army of helpless government agents to get through to the President, blows anything the first film had to offer right out of the water.With mutant antagonist Magneto (Ian McKellen) imprisoned in a plastic cell, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is focusing his time on helping the maturing students at his school for gifted youngsters. He has sent Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to Alkali Lake, in the hope of helping him discover more about his past, but he finds nothing but an abandoned military base. After the attack on the President, government operative William Stryker (Brian Cox) leads an attack on the unsuspecting Xavier's school, capturing Xavier and Cyclops (James Marsden) in order to strengthen his mysterious plans.The plot summary is as compressed as can be, as, like the first film, X2 has a lot of big personalities with big, special powers with their own individual stories to tell to cram into a two-hour film. Although there are mutants with far more interesting powers and greater physical potential, the focus remains on the fan-favourite Wolverine. It's Jackman's enigmatic performance that makes him so easily likable, and he is finally allowed to roam free here. There are no soft fights where nobody dies as in X-Men; Wolverine massacres many of Stryker's men during the attack on the school. When he first drives his claws into an agent who makes the mistake of firing on him, it is the first of many air-punching moments throughout the film.It's hard to fathom a threat that could actually make a dent in a race of people with such unbelievable powers, so Stryker, a man with no liking for mutants but a fascination with harnessing their powers, has found a way to subdue them. Seeing a mutant like Magneto so helpless is oddly affecting, so, after his spectacular prison break-out, he becomes a sort of anti-hero, doing the kind of dirty work Xavier would not lower himself to. But ultimately, it's the Xavier-Magneto good vs. evil fight that remains the most fascinating, and even with Stryker playing the main villain, Magneto is far from forgotten and has plans to bend Stryker's actions to his own personal gain.It's a shame then that X2 marks the high-point of the series. There is now a remarkable 7 instalments set in the X-universe, and although X- Men: First Class (2011) injected some life back in the series, and hopes are high for the new X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), none have come close to the kind of energy and invention of this. Though you could complain about the lack of a coherent narrative, and that some of the minor characters are left out to dry, X2 is a near-perfect superhero movie, and is still Marvel's greatest achievement. And with almost 15 years of men in tights and capes, that is high praise indeed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","byght","2 May 2003","The first X-MEN was, I felt, a very successful outing.  But it lacked the momentous feel and captivating energy of, for example, SPIDER-MAN--which captured perfectly everything that made the comics so wonderful.  X-MEN was a skillful adaptation from a difficult medium with some great performances from 2 great actors, but I wouldn't exactly term it ""great.""X2 is great.  Better than the first, better, even, than SPIDER-MAN.  Not just by a little, but by a lot.From the opening sequence (I'm not gonna ruin it), it's pretty apparent that we're in for something more.  Bryan Singer brings his stylistic influence to bear on this film a lot more than in the original--and the results are appreciated.  His little touches of cinematic deftness make one appreciate the value of having a great director even on a blockbuster action project like this.Another improvement is the length--no joke.  X2 is able to tell a much deeper, and, well, BIGGER story than the first because it's got over 2 hours to do it in.  The extra time allows for more and better action sequences (MUCH better; am I the only one who was a little underwhelmed by the Wolverine/Mystique sequences from the first movie?), sure, but perhaps more importantly it allows for more character.  Not just character development, character INTERACTION--something the original needed more of.  Wolverine and Iceman in the kitchen, for instance, is a great example of the kind of hanging-out-at-the-X-Mansion scenes that helped give the comic book such depth and breadth.SPIDER-MAN was great because it focused not as much on recreating exactly the classic STORY of the comics, but on recreating the things that made that story so great in the first place.  X-MEN did this to an extent, but not as well.  X2 does it better than both of them, and that's why it's a better film than both of them.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tedg","14 May 2003","Spoilers herein.I have enthusiastic hopes for big budget action pictures. That's because the market is so crowded, and the viewing public so visually sophisticated that we know that some thought must go into these things. This is especially so when you are building a franchise, because memories fade. In fact, this movie will probably be forgotten two weeks after the Matrix sequel appears.But on the other hand, sometimes these projects are so costly, and have such a large distributed creative team that risk drives the thing to the ordinary. In contrast, `Daredevil' was pretty cinematic. The second Harry Potter was a landmark in architectural use of space. The Donners have a reputation for having a deep understanding of how film works and how to intelligently exploit it. So I expected at least a few things excellent.We DO get movement. We DO have one fight sequence that is well crafted - aptly between the two combatants that are uniquely enhanced by technology. But the sets are amazingly, shockingly, scandalously unimaginative. The little soap opera is predictable and trivial enough - a Marvel legacy. The characters are generally flat. In the comic, they are - compared to other comics - human; here - compared to other film characters - cartoons. Huge Actman overacts hugely in a parody of Russell Crowe. Stewart does his continuing impression of what Shakespeare might do for TeeVee. For some reason the kids here are turned into, well, kids. The only mildly interesting characters are:-Famke Janssen. She is a very limited actress, but all such professional lives find that one role that is perfect for them. Everything about her fits, especially compared to the other women who are somewhat less limited as actresses. That hair color is something. I wish there were a film hair technician website.-Ian McKellan, who truly IS a Shakespearean of the British cast, which is to say he is a language rather than a facial/body technician. He molds words, fabricates them into weapons and throws them like the metal globules he steals from the guard's blood. Watch this.-Alan Cumming who makes a career out of comically annotating evil.But these three just do their own thing without any relation to anyone else in the film or creating the film. In contrast, the Jason/girl combo is a pretty thrilling idea especially in the context of being the son of the mad scientist (whose science incidentally seems beyond what the Shakespereans could do). That girl is the creation of Stryker dad after the tradition of `Forbidden Planet.` Now think about that - and how she is dressed - a minute and the perversion becomes pretty rich and astonishing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ilovedolby","4 May 2003","When we left the X-Men in the first movie, Magneto was caught and placed in a plastic prison and Wolverine was leaving Professor Xavier's school for mutant children in a search for answers to his past. We are now re-united with the X-Men in the second film of what looks to become a series in `X2: X-Men United.' 	This is the first of many sequels due out during the 2003 summer box-office season. One thing may make this film stand out among every other sequel this summer-the fact that it's very good. In fact, `X2: X-Men United' is the rare case in which a sequel didn't follow the conventional clichÃ©d patterns that so many sequels do by rehashing everything the first film; thus, the reason why sequels are generally inferior movies when compared to their predecessors. 	The story centers on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seeking clues to his past-an experiment that left his skeleton covered in a very strong metal. And of course, this metal makes his character more deadly considering the fact that he has blades that protrude from his knuckles whenever he senses danger. But things change for all mutants when a mutant assassin named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), tries to kill the president in protest of a ÂMutant Registration Act.' This attempt only increases the fear that many have for the mutants and leads a military leader named William Stryker (Brian Cox) to lead a campaign against the mutants, beginning with Professor Xavier's school. It's now up to all mutants, be they friend or foe, to unite against an enemy that could eliminate all mutants. 	It's clear that director Bryan Singer (`Apt Pupil,' `The Usual Suspects') had more freedom in the production. The film is longer than the first film by about 30 minutes. What's more, it isn't as flashy as the original film. Point in fact; it is a far darker tale that leaves its central characters in the worst possible situation, a rule that is often ignored in sequels or trilogies. 	I did like the fact that this film united all mutants, putting aside their differences in an attempt to save their race. After seeing the first `X-Men,' I felt that there were some gaps in the dialogue, and the film quickly moved from one scene to the next. But that complaint was minor, as the first film was rather impressive. Nonetheless, `X2' is more than a worthy sequel; filled with great action sequences along with impressive visual effects that it doesn't rely on to tell the story, it's arguably better than the first film. Patrick Stewart (`Conspiracy Theory') returns as Charles Xavier, as does Ian McKellen (`Gods And Monsters') as Magneto. Anna Paquin (`25th Hour') returns as Rogue who takes Iceman's breath away, played by Shawn Ashmore. Aaron Stanford (`Tadpole') ignites the screen as Pyro. Dr. Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen (`Goldeneye') tries to avoid temptation with Wolverine, while Scott Summers, played by James Marsden (`Gossip') tries to control his temper with Wolverine. And of course, the X-Men wouldn't be complete without Storm, played by Halle Berry (`Monster's Ball'), around to wreak havoc.	 Released on what has become the typical starter weekend of the summer box-office, `X2' looks to become a huge smash hit with early weekend estimates predicting the film to make nearly $86 million in nationwide ticket sales.  It's not as large as last year's magnanimous opening weekend for `Spider-Man,' which made $114 million, but it is doubtful that Twentieth Century Fox will be complaining much about the success of the film.`X2: X-Men United' is a true blockbuster that is a real crowd-pleaser in which it is difficult to find something to criticize. ***","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","CubsandCulture","27 January 2021","I think I am in the minority here but I greatly prefer the first film. It is more streamlined and focused in its story. This one tries to do too much-especially setting up the Phoenix Saga-and the film would have been better served cutting some stuff out. It is not only that the final film is unwieldly but the film loses much of upon inspection. Xavier's walk to Cerebro 2.0 seems to take like 19 hours but that makes little sense. A whole bunch of choices don't gel together and can add up to unintentional comedy, i.e. Logan carrying the kid while confronting Stryker. The film's analogy-or allegory-around mutant equals LGBT identity is a lot less graceful than the more generalized marginalized people in the 1st film. The ""coming out"" scene is tacky and has dated badly.With that said the film has several bright spots. The opening scene is one of the best action scenes of the aughts . Indeed, Nightcrawler's inclusion was more than welcomed and his story still resonates in spite of the larger issues. The following films in the series-generally-never returned to this level of engagement but this film has a lot of the problems the later film have as well.","

I remember adoring it in the theater and later at home on DVD, but by today's standards it's hokey and hard to take seriously. I'm not sure if that's a symptom of the better comic book movies being released as a direct result of this franchise or a simple case of the old rose-colored goggles, but either way it wasn't nearly the tour de force I had remembered. That being said, the sheer amount of acting star power in this film is still astonishing from top to bottom, and it remains a quality action flick. Xavier's first sequel remains a fine moment; it's just been surpassed.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Horst_In_Translation","5 June 2017","""X2"" or ""X-Men 2"" is an American (mostly) English-language film from 2003, so this one will have its 15th anniversary next year. It is the second film from the long-running X-Men franchise that culminated in ""Logan"" this year, my favorite film of the year so far still and that one got me curious to check out some of the older films from this series. Watched the very first not too long ago and I liked that one, even if for other reasons compared to this one here. This second film is considerably longer than the first, namely it runs for 2 hours 15 minutes and that's quite a lot. The cast includes many actors that also appeared in the very first and also some from Logan still. But back to ""X2"": Anna Paquin is back too of course, even if obviously far from being as much in the center as she was in the first film. It's not really possible to identify a single character or actor as lead here. It is basically an ensemble performance and it would be interesting to see who has the most screen time. Jackman perhaps? I am not sure. The script is also an ensemble piece as it includes a massive quantity of five writers with one of them being Bryan Singer who also already directed the first film. Sure 135 minutes is very long, but this amount of writers is perhaps still a bit too much. And there were moments when you could talk about too many cooks spoiling the broth. I would say that this applies mostly to the middle part as these 45 minutes were packed with action, but in terms of storytelling it was a bit of a letdown compared to the first 45 minutes, the best part of the movie. The final 45 minutes are somewhere in-between quality-wise.Anyway, it takes quite a while to understand who the main antagonist is. Early on, it seems as if it may be the character portrayed by Alan Cummings (""The Good Wife""), but that perception changes drastically when we see the antagonist is oh so human only. But he is still powerful enough to convince even Ian McKellen's evil mastermind character to join forces with the good guys. Politics are a major component in here, not only because the President of the United States appears pretty quickly, but yeah, it is once again about tolerance, acceptance and witch-hunt when it comes to mutants. And in the end, it seems as if there are losses for both sides when one major character loses her life apparently, perhaps also to keep the writers from having to elaborate further on love stories in the X-Men universe and (SPOILER) even if I like Famke Janssen as an actress (sure more than Romijn and Berry), it may have been an okay decision. Then again, I see she is back for future films again, so we will see what explanation they will give us for that. So yeah there are pros and cons for this film. It is obviously not on the same level as ""Logan"", but it is still a fairly decent achievement overall and a convincing sequel. I just wish they could have kept the effects-packed second third a bit shorter as it really would have helped the film's focus overall. Nonetheless, what happened in here did actually get me curious about the third film from the franchise. I will make sure to check it out at some point in the coming weeks/months. ""X2"" gets a thumbs-up from me and I recommend checking it out.","

You gotta root for her.Lotsa nods to the fans-'Hank McCoy' on TV, files mentioning Sentinels, a Phoenix image in the water at the end, etc. All that. Plus Iceman too. The plot was the standard Superhero/Bond kinda thingie that you really should waste time trying to follow or guage for realism, that is besides the point if anything.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","classicsoncall","28 July 2012","Lots of good stuff here for Marvel Comic fans. The number of characters went beyond the first film, recognizing that viewers would be expecting to see even more mutants this time around. I thought the opening sequence was pretty exciting with Nightcrawler's (Alan Cumming) attack on the President. Not being a Marvel reader, I didn't know who he was, and it was interesting to learn his identity about the same time as Wolverine and some of the other X-Men.The theme of humans versus mutants was taken to the next level here with the introduction of Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox). His mission to rid the world of all mutants emboldens the Xavier and Magneto forces to line up against him and makes for an uneasy alliance of traditional foes. At times the story is a little hard to follow, because with a shape-shifting character like Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), the significance of a scene can be changed on a dime, as in the time Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) comes on to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and the character transforms repeatedly to confuse him. Imagine having to deal with something like that in real life? I think comic fans also appreciate how the film incorporates the back story of Wolverine obtaining his adamantium skeleton and his unique healing powers. The back drop of Xavier's School for the Gifted also serves the purpose of bringing comic book readers back to the origins of the X-Men as a way to reveal their more human side. I would have liked a little more humor here though; there were missed opportunities where a little more sarcasm or wit could have improved the dialog.One question - after a rampage like the one at Xavier's school, who cleans up all those dead bodies?","

It sort of takes the fuel out of the fire when you realize how ""real"" your super power problem story is.While this has a slightly better premise, and good plot skeleton, there is a lot of ""(mostly Wolverine does) something cool here"" stuff, but there are at least 2 large exceptions with multiple mutants working together that end up being a ""lot of cool stuff"", but also add some significance to the story and heavily progress the plot.I'd honestly recommend anyone watch this over the original.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","dunmore_ego","4 December 2004","X-SPOILERS.Unfortunate that X1 and X2 are now associated with these mutant movies, instead of their original references Â Bell's X1 aircraft, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first documented to break the sound barrier in 1947 Â never forget that, young-uns! Successive X-numbers denoted successive prototypes.Has there ever been a more perfectly-cast movie than X2? So many characters fitting our preconceptions so absolutely Â er - except for Cyclops, whose role is disconcertingly minimal, as it was in X-Men. Comicbook Cyclops Scott Summers was always the undisputed Leader of the group, exuding a patriarchal air amongst the very first x-youngsters to the present. Movie Cyclops James Marsden exudes all the presence of a day-player, or some guy in a bar in Miami in an episode of Girls Gone Wild.Jean Grey's character is also abused somewhat. Firstly Â that hair Â not working, honey! Gone are comicbook Jean's cascading, volcanic-red, lava-locks (too 80s for this modern film? - but no worse than the Anime cartoon hairstyle she now sports); will it have to come down to an episode of VH1's 50 Awesomely Badder Hairdos to acknowledge this soccer mom abomination? And before we know it, Jean is gone. In a dramatic high-point, sexily holding back a wall of water while simultaneously powering up the X-Jet, she is sacrificed; a device which had to occur for Jean Grey's overwhelming Phoenix force to achieve illimitable psionic freedom (Hep me! Hep me! I'm sliding into geekery!...) In essence, in just two movies her character traverses an arc which took decades of comics to develop. Movies, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of comicbook shelf-life; plots that were developed over thousands of inter-connected comics must necessarily be composited into a few films, before the franchise goes to pot with new directors, unfamiliar and unlikeable cast and widened demographic mundanity. i.e. it ALWAYS ends up G-rated, with scenes of soldiers crawling out of exploded military vehicles to prove that they are still alive.The film unflinchingly supplies each major character with an interesting arc; an almost insurmountable undertaking, considering the plethora of varied roles and interlocking story lines. Director Singer and writers have done an incredible job, full tilt boogie Â even the day-player Cyclops gets his moment to kick butt and take names - but is ultimately taken down by a chick Â girly-man style!Before I go on, I must clarify: this is an excellent movie, well-filmed, well-written, well-acted Â and hey! Wolverine! 'nuff said! - but it is not without its illogicities.An example: Rogue is sucked out of the disabled X-Jet and Nightcrawler bamfs out and retrieves her, bringing her back onboard safely Â excellently illustrating his power's utility - BUT - well, he's back in the out-of-control X-Jet! - why not bamf to the GROUND INSTEAD, EINSTEIN? Matter of fact, why not individually bamf EVERYONE down to the ground? This is the quandary that writers of superhero films must face: all these beings put together make up a formidable force and if they logically reasoned through any predicament, NOTHING could ultimately harm them. When Wolverine barks, 'Don't we have any weapons in this heap?', the full portent of his question hits us when Storm's eyes go white Â they're ALL Walking Weapons. Yet here is another mis-use of 'power' from that same scene: Couldn't Storm (who has just conjured more twisters than there were in the movie Twister) conjure a mighty updraft to float the X-Jet safely to earth?; couldn't Jean (who has just utilized her telekinesis to explode a missile) also float the jet down safely?; couldn't Iceman create a slide of ice?; the potential list of 'saves' goes on Â yet, it's Airport '75 up in that converted Blackbird and Our Man Charlton ain't nowhere in sight. Instances like these really make you wonder whether you ARE on the Right Side, rooting for these insensate clowns, when the ostensible Bad Guy Â Magneto Â is the only one with any brains, balls or mutant clout to actually SAVE the jet.Admittedly, even in the comics, utilization of super-powers are oft-times foregone in favor of plot development.The DVD commentaries *infuriate* with their naivete: cast and crew misuse and completely misunderstand the word 'evolution', continually saying 'evolve' where they simply should say 'develop', illustrating an utter ignorance of this world-shaping concept. 'Evolution' is a process by which mutated genes, if they enable an organism to better adapt to its environment, are 'selected' and passed on. Less-adaptable organisms are leached out of the pathway of Life vis a vis 'natural selection'. Not being an essay on 'evolution' per se, this skeletal description will have to suffice to illustrate the ingenuousness of terms like 'character evolution'.The DVD also bludgeons viewers with the unsubtle 'message' of tolerance. As if the raison d'etre of this movie IS to promote tolerance and NOT to make sinful amounts of exploitative cash. By exploiting a 'minority' existing in fantasy, they audaciously attach this analogy to world problems, and then pretend they CARE. The fact that this movie issues from one of the most insular, IN-tolerant places on earth Â Hollywood Â makes that 'message' all the more hypocritical and straight-up shameless prevarication.The X-Men's 'message' has nothing to do with why this film was made - the current rash of superhero movies is not being voraciously consumed faster than they can be made because audiences wish to imbue themselves with spiritual elevation; no, superhero-mania is the latest fad in a long line of film fads Â remember all those 'war' movies after WWII?; all the 'westerns' of the forties through sixties; the 'cop' films of the seventies; 'slasher' films of the eighties; the genres of 'baseball', 'family', 'romantic comedies', et al. 'Superhero' films now join the carousel of bankable corporate products Â because the generation who grew up enamored with comics is now at an age where THEY are making the major business decisions in the world. So please Â spare us the faux-philanthropy and get on with entertaining us for our cash.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","scirceo","13 May 2003","I looked forward to X2 with great anticipation. All the things I'd heard about it were positive. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed.X2 lacks the charm of the first movie. In that one, we got to know the characters a bit. X2 adds a couple characters (Wagner and Stryker) who are not very interesting, nor are they very well-developed.I know, I know, this is a comic book. Okay, fine, but so was X-Men, and I really enjoyed that movie. This one was just boring to me -- not a lot of suspense, no plot twists, predictable action. Had I been alone, I would have walked out.Do yourself a favor and rent X-Men or the first Batman, or go see A Mighty Wind, but don't waste your time and money on this movie. I most enjoyed the way Magneto escapes from his prison. Nicely done.--Steve","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Sirus_the_Virus","20 August 2009","X2: X-Men united is without a doubt the best in the series. I thought the first film was rather short, but the sequel improved a lot. If you were curious about Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) in the last film then you learn a tad about him in this film. If you've seen X-Men origins: Wolverine, than you should think that that's a prequel to this. It's a prequel to the entire series. But that film relates mostly to this film. The sequel has everyone from the original film returning, including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Halle Berry, Famke Jansen, and others. Also, Bryan Singer, a decent director who has had some great films like The Usual Suspects, returns also. He has improved the sequel in many ways. Not that the original was bad, I really liked the original film. The sequel has something that the original didn't have. I can't think of what it is, but X2: X-Men united truly is the best in the series and is one of the best comic book films. Not quite a Dark Knight, but it is still a great movie.The Plot: The X-Men are in a pickle when a general from Wolverine's past comes and kidnaps some of the students. They also try to hunt down an assassin who tried to kill the president.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","The Overdrama","2 May 2003","""X-Men"" sucked, with the exception of Hugh Jackman's performance. Hokeyness abounded with the mutant machine and how Rogue got her white streak.""X2,"" however, is a different story - it was brilliant! Loaded with fanboy nods galore (see Wizard Magazine #140 for a list), this film must have been inspired by the awesome effects brought on by ""Spider-Man."" Colossus's cameo served very well, his armor and role adapted excellently. Siryn and Shadowcat were funny, but other cameos were more surprising. I noticed Beast's brief TV appearance because I was looking for it, but I only wish I had known to look for Sebastian Shaw and Gambit (played by James Bamford - BAMFord as in Nightcrawler's ""BAMF?"" lol).Nightcrawler was depicted very well also. He was both pious and humorous, and even exhibited an Oedipus complex when talking to Mystique (his mother in comics). Odd, though, that no one made mention of the smell of brimstone his teleportation creates, nor any jokes about the sound ""BAMF.""Lady Deathstrike was a bit disappointing. The codename was never used and she only bared her claws once. Kelly Hu would have made a much better Psylocke, though - an English-Chinese-Hawaiian actress portraying an English-turned-Chinese character.Somehow, Ian McKellan, Anna Paquin, and Shawn Ashmore came across as their respective characters much more convincingly than in the first film.The two biggest surprises of the film were those of Jean Grey and ol' Wolvie. Jean goes Phoenix, and Wolvie cries!!!Highly recommended, even to those who hated the first movie.PS - Could one of Stryker's soldiers have been Maverick? Hmmm.PPS - Who was that mutant kid changing the TV channels by blinking?! I cannot for the life of me figure it out. My father, not an X-pert, said that maybe he had a connection to Jean Grey because of his telekinetic powers. My brother then said that maybe it was Cable, who is connected to Jean. I said it couldn't be him because he's from the future. My brother then said he was kidding - the kid was changing TV CHANNELS so he was CABLE. Ha, ha.","

From the opening action with new mutant Nightcrawler we know we are in for a amazing ride. The action sequences are taken to the next level in the film, the script is witty and there's a few surpises for us hardcore X-Men fans.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Aaron1375","3 May 2003","I thought this movie would be pretty good, but from the trailers I thought there would be way to many characters.  For the most part though they mainly focused on those who returned from the first movie, with only Nightcrawler and Pyro being the only new characters that showcased their powers.  I was a bit disappointed not to see much of Colossus, and Iceman didn't really do much, but aside from that this one was really good.  I also wished Cyclops was in it more, but that made for an interesting sidepiece as this movie takes place on three fronts.  McKellan is great as Magneto and all the other cast is rather good as well.  Though I loved watching Magneto escape from the prison.  Lady Deathstrike really didn't have too much screen time and she had only one line, but she had one heck of a fight with Wolverine in this one.  Though I wish their fight was a bit longer.  The highlights of this one include of course the fight with Wolvie and Deathstrike, the cool opening scene with Nightcrawler, the scene where Pyro goes berserk, and the scene where the troops raid Xavier's school.  There are other cool scenes in there, but these were my favorites.  I don't think the movie ended as weak as some movie critics have said it did, but it wasn't the best feature of the film.  I also didn't care for the introduction of the Phoenix character they gave flashes of throughout.  I don't know if it will go with the movie formula all that well.  All in all a good film, could have ended better, but I am just being picky.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Axel-9","12 May 2003","Finally I've seen it. And now I want to see it again. I wouldn't judge it against past efforts just yet, but, and only time will tell properly, this is probably the best comic book adaptation to date. Bryan Singer has done a fantastic job, giving the characters space to feel but also remembers to let them kick some ass, and what a way to kick off proceedings with Nightcrawler bamfing through the Whitehouse. What makes that scene so fine isn't just the action packed thrill of it. Well that helps but the scene is also integral to the plot, making it more than just eye candy. It's a great way to introduce a new character, and means that when we find out about his tragic past, our attention has already been won.
The rest of the film runs in a similar vein, building upon what we already know and adding to the characters personas. Inevitably with such a large cast some don't come of as well, mainly Storm and Cyclops. This is a minor gripe though as the characterisation elsewhere is spot on.
Iceman and Rogue's almost tragic relationship, with Iceman unable to kiss her is well played by both Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Iceman's coming out to his parents demonstrates more ability on Ashmore's part and he seems to be a young actor with some emotional range. The exchange with his mother where he is asked 'Have you ever tried not being a mutant' captured the adolscent-esque awkwardness of his situation. Aaron Stanford conveys the burgeoning hatred of humans, that his Jon Allerdyce/Pyro feels. The glee with which he attacks police officers sent to arrest the mutants is well played. As the viewer we know there is something distinctly dark about this boy. His exchange with Magneto where he is asked 'what's your real name?' by the magnetic master is the moment he knows being human is no longer an issue.Then of course there is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Jackman has real presence, and dominates whenever he's on screen even when faced with the similarly adamantium pumped Yuriko Oyama, or trading words with Brian Cox's sinister Stryker. He certainly had the acting chops to carry the first film and is excellent whenever given the opportunity here. His improvised answer of 'Art' when asked what subject he teaches brought a cackle and his ability to deliver such one liners is often in evidence. He can do the emotional stuff too though, with scenes involving him chasing after the unattainable love and looking almost apologetic after he dispatches Oyama after their climactic fight. That actually made the fight better for me, as after all the hype it never quite had the required impact on me, but Jackman's understanding of Wolverine's reaction to killing one like himself shows.Both Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart as the mutant elders give solid performances. Famke Janssen is good value as Jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin Stamos cuts loose a number of times as Mystique, ironically turning up as 'herself' to entrap a prison guard in a bar.Overall I really did like the movie. It develops well, splitting the characters and re-uniting them in a steady flow for the finale. The plot resonates with the zeitgeist of the world with parallels being drawn to many recent events. Ignoring these it's still a kick ass bit of entertainment, so if you want to be bothered with the themes of acceptance and hatred of those that are different or just want to see an F-16 get knocked out by a tornado there is something there for all.Mutation has allowed X2 to leap to the top of the pile of this year's blockbusters and allowed it to plant a very firm foot there. It'll take some shifting.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","scott-sw","14 February 2008","X-2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines the original. I liked the original X-Men. While it was good, X-2, X-Men United is superb. It picks up where X-Men left off. Logan (Wolverine) is returning from his quest to discover his origin. Meanwhile, a new Mutant, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) makes at attempt on the President's life. Enter Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who vows to stop the Mutants for good. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) asks for Dr. Jean Grey (Fahmke Jansen) and Storm (Halle Berry) to find this new mutant. Meanwhile, he must consult with his old nemesis, Eric Lynch, or Magneto (Ian McKellan). Dr. Xavier and Cyclops, aka Scott Sommers (James Masden) are captured by Stryker. At the same time, a hit squad goes after the young Mutants at Dr. Xavier's school. Barely escaping are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Rogue (Amanda Paquin), Iceman, and Pyro. Then, Magneto escapes with the help of his co-hort, Mystique (Rebecca Rojmin Stamos). The plot may seem labyrinth, but it works well, again showing why Marvel superheros always outdid DC Comics. In the first place, Mavel characters are reluctant heroes, often having a downside to their power. Rogue can never touch another human being, isolating herself from others. Cyclops can never look at someone with his own eyes. Second, the Marvel superheroes are thrust into the real world. People fear them, hate them, and want them relegated to the fringe of society. The movie also goes deeper, cutting into society and their reaction to the Mutant ""threat."" In X-Men, the villain was Bruce Davison who plays a Senator reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy who used the Red Scare in the 1950's to alienate his enemies as ""Communists."" In X-2, the villain is Stryker. He does not want to use politics, he just wants to eradicate the Mutants--more like Slobodan Milosovec. The movie also takes the end of the struggle for equity. In both movie, it seems Dr. Xavier has the idealism and hope of Dr. Martin Luther King, whereas Magneto is a separatist who strikes back like Malcom X. Laced between the depth is a good-paced story with credible acting, good action sequences, and special effects that do not overshadow the story. The performances are another praise. James Marsden actually does a decent acting job as Cyclops. Ian McKellan is able to make the audience sympathize with Magneto, despite the character's cynicism and dubious methods. Brian Cox also does well as the real heavy. For a change, the villain is not over the top or a megalomaniac. He is the true, subtle type of evil--convincing himself he is doing society good. Rebecca Rojmin Staimos does her acting with her moves and stare--emitting a subtle, yet powerful evil. On the other hand, Alan Cummings gives us a Mutant who not only has a love of life, but also a faith that does not come off as self-righteous or preachy. X-2 may lack a beginning, middle, and end, but it works so well as a great superhero movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Dougie B","10 May 2003","I was lucky enough to see this film digitally projected (I've read that there were only 35-45 theaters in the US that are doing this.)  Living in Los Angeles, you have to deal with smog, freeways, and attitudes, but at least you get digitally projected movies!Having watched the movie projected on film the week before, I already knew what to expect from the story, so I probably wasn't as blown away as I should have been by certain sequences, especially the opening with Nightcrawler.  But what I got was a perfectly crisp picture - no film scratches, no annoying reel changes with ""cigarette burns"" followed by an audio pop.  If you don't know what a ""cigarette burn"" is, see ""Fight Club,"" but I warn you - you'll always be conscious of it every you see a movie in the theater.There were however at times, when the picture was a little too perfect. Some shots looked blurry, like they had blown up the film a little to get a closer shot.  I don't know if they actually did this, but that's what it looked like.  A few times when there was A LOT of action and camera movement, there was some SLIGHT blur and picture jumping.  And by this I do mean SLIGHT.  Unless you were looking for it, you probably wouldn't have noticed it.  Also, some of the edges on objects on the screen seemed a little jagged at times, but then again, this wasn't that noticable.Don't get me wrong, these are only minor criticisms.  Do I prefer the digital projection?  Definitely.  This is the third digitally projection film I've seen, the other two being Episode II and Toy Story 2.  The biggest differences here is that these two movies were created digitally while X2 was shot on film and transferred.  The picture was still superior, but not mind-blowing (and it made Mystique and Nightcrawler's make-up jobs look a lot more like make-up)While I preferred the digital projection, I wouldn't tell you to plan a road trip to seek out a theater that has it like I would have for Episode II and Toy Story 2.  If you're going to see it, and there is a theater around that does have it, then go for it!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Beta_Gallinger","22 April 2008","When I went to see this in the theatre back in 2003, I had never seen the first ""X-Men"" movie, but could remember some of the main characters fairly well, thanks to certain childhood memories, mainly from watching the animated TV series. I'm not exactly sure how impressed I was when I saw this sequel to the 2000 blockbuster, so it obviously wasn't the greatest movie-going experience I've ever had, but it definitely was better than going to see ""Hulk"" about a month later. Since then, however, I have seen all three movies in the trilogy more than once, and would say this is the best one, the worst being the third.During a White House tour, a mutant comes along and soon attacks, attempting to assassinate the President! The President is saved, but after this, the mutant population is once again in danger, as the fear and hatred of mutants from the rest of humanity increases! A scientist and military leader named William Stryker, a major threat to the mutant population, gathers information from the now imprisoned Magneto about the X-Mansion! He then comes to the mansion with his armed forces, where they attack the school! Some mutants manage to escape, including Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro, who go and meet up with Jean and Storm. Meanwhile, Stryker has managed to capture Professor Charles Xavier and intends to use him for his evil plans against mutants! Magneto soon escapes from his prison cell, and he and Mystique meet up with a group of X-Mansion residents. The mutants must put aside their differences for now and unite to stop Stryker! Like its predecessor, and like most other comic book movies from recent years, ""X2"" has some fairly weak moments. The White House attack scene could have been better, and perhaps choral music wasn't the best choice for it. However, overall, this is another comic book movie that works. For those who want action and suspense, there's lots of that in this film, as well as some excellent sets and special effects (not unlike the first film), but that's not all. The movie adds another character who was not in the first movie named Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, a mutant who turns out to be good. He's a good addition to the story, and what he tells Storm and Jean when they find him is a very moving moment in the film, which reminds me, the story here is a bit deeper and more moving than that of the first live action ""X-Men"" feature. Like the original, there are also some good humorous moments, such as a cat purring and licking Wolverine's claws. Lastly, the dialogue in the film is sometimes weak (which can be expected in these comic book movies from the past ten years or so), but some of the dialogue is quite strong (including the Kurt Wagner speech I mentioned), which cannot be said about some of the other recent comic book movies, some of which are pretty lame.If you didn't like the first movie in the ""X-Men"" trilogy, or you dislike recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, then you're probably not missing much if you haven't seen this sequel. As you probably know already, you might as well skip it. Some people generally don't care for films of this type, whether the films are well-received or not. However, I'm sure most people who have been impressed with the 2000 comic book movie have also been impressed with this sequel, many of them more so than they have been the original, and I think that includes me! Sequels are usually expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but occasionally, there are times when they turn out to be superior, and I guess this is one of those cases, even though the third installment, "" X-Men: The Last Stand"" turned out to be significantly inferior to both of the previous installments, unfortunately.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","MOscarbradley","23 April 2006","The plot is incomprehensible, the special effects superb and the imagination unbridled, (though some may say it could do with some bridling). Bryan Singer's follow-up to the first ""X Men"" movie has the characters already established, (though newcomers may find it hard to figure out who's who), so he gets straight down to the plot. Thematically that could be written on the back of a postage stamp, so it's action all the way. The problem isn't so much that it doesn't make sense but rather that there is so little to make sense of. And we have the right to feel cheated that potentially serious themes like racism and ethnic cleansing are given such short shift, (am I reading too much into this nonsense?).However, for most of it's length it's highly entertaining in a baffling sort of way. It moves at a cracking pace which unfortunately means that characters are never long enough on screen to develop. This is particularly true of Wolverine who this time round is reduced to a cypher. On the other hand, Alan Cumming's fallen angel is a blast and Cumming is the best thing in the movie. The fact that Ian McKellen's Magneto disappears before the end is an obvious indication that ""X Men 3"" was already in the offing.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","gregsrants","4 May 2003","There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2.The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyones favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villians are back for an encore, Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) plays the metal manipulator Magneto,  and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Aaron Stanford plays the fire manipulating Pyro, Kelly Hu plays the quiet but deadly Deathstrike and Alan Cummings steals the show as the blue faced teleporter Nightcrawler.With a cast of characters as strong and dilluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves to the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, you will not be disappointed.  The story is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil General William Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to prevent the threat they impose.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor who is being forced to mentally link with all the mutants on earth, for the purpose of their destruction. There are many subplots in X2.  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, and the special effects are top rate, and the body count (missing from the first movie), piles up fast.Wolverine commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the school and later with DeathStrike, is better than anything filmed in the earlier released superhero film Daredevil.Those comic book enthusiasts will not leave disappointed and will have an advantage over the average movie goer.  You will get glimpses of Colosses, Kitty Pryde, and there are enough scenes of the Blackbird that the plane should have been given an acting credit.Mostly, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him.  He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for a third.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.Especially in today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters join forces whenever evil threatens all.  Don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like this even more enjoyable.In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third.  B+.","

X - Men was a huge success in 2000 and a sequel was just a metter of time, and here it is, and it was worth waiting for. Bryan Singer doesn't longer have problems under the action scenes, and both ways: it's better action, and more action.Hugh Jackman's iconic character Wolverine (or Logan) is still the main focus and steals most of the show, but though also Storm, Jean Grey, Magneto, Mystique and three new guys: the stylish and slick Nightcrawler, the bad-ass Pyro, the mysterious Lady Deathstrike and the relaxed Ice-man. Though, haven't I forgot someone, oh yes: Cyclops! Or? Did I really forget him? He's a whimp, so I don't care much. But the thing is; it's a great movie! Scenes as when the mutant school gets attacked by military soldiers and Wolverine starts cutting sick, or as when Pyro fires his blasts against the cops, or the superb opening scene when Nightcrawler tries assassinating the president of the United States, man, this movie has lots to offer you! This time we get to dig deeper into Wolverine's dark and unknown past, who's a very interesting part of the main story who is about a military general (Stryker) that has been searching on mutants for a long time, and was the one that made Wolverine, he returns, starting a small warfare between mutants and human! Cool plot.Wolverine is...yeah, the new Clint in western, the new Rambo in the jungle, the new Terminator in machines...he's rough! As lines as he says: ""You picked the wrong house buddy!!"" or ""If you want to shoot me, shoot me!!!"" as he flash his claws threw his fists, great!!! Absolutely great! X2, is one of the bests sequels ever, together with Star Wars Episode V, Terminator 2, Aliens and The Godfather. And it is; the best superhero movie ever! Still the Batman movies from Burton and Spider-Man are challenegers, this -  is ass kicking mayhem!The new mutants are all fabulous. Especially Alan Cumming's performance as the telepatic Nightcrawler who's originally a German guy named Kurt Wagner. And also Ice-Man who had a small role in the first movie, and the new angry Pyro, fantastic as he roles upon: ""You know about the dangerous mutants you hear about on the news...I'm the worst one!!"" And last, not that great but good-looking Lady Deathstrike played by Asian beauty Kelly Hu, doesn't do much but fights well when she finally does!

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","oneloveall","29 September 2006","Decent sequel pulls all the expected punches to topple it's predecessor, albeit in it's fanbase appeasement way. Continuing right where we left off, viewers are pretty much treated to a parallel go-around, although there have been a few noticeable tweaks. Action scenes, while still not nearly as stylish as potential would have, are filmed more fluidly and hold more intrigue then some of the undercooked action of the original. While the film still suffers from it's callous, measured approach, thankfully the cast's principal leads outshine the duller supporting ones. While Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey look and perhaps feel the part, their dry interpretation as usual takes away from some of the excitement, thankfully carried by the core actors. Fans will surely be pleased with a continued focus to bring the Xmen to screen, but casual movie-goers will likely feel indifferent as they enjoy their dosage of eye candy..","

When the lights came up he turned and asked me how it grabbed me - ""It didn't"" - I replied to which he said - ""Me, neither.""Seriously. Is it too much to ask for a story that makes sense, characters that we care about and action scenes that are choreographed and lit well? Halfway through I wanted to get up and leave. The only enjoyment all night was the Matrix trailer that was at least 10 times more exciting than anything in this snooze-a-thon.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","FilmFanInTheHouse","30 November 2007","X2 (2003, Dir. Bryan Singer) After the events on Liberty Island, everyone at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters are settling in. Magneto is locked up in a plastic cell, Rogue and Bobby Drake have finally got together, and Wolverine has set off to find the origins of where he came from. But it wont stay quiet for long. After a mutant attack on the President, everyone starts to fear any type of mutant. William Stryker who plans to stop all mutants, takes over the school, causing Wolverine and his team of mutants to go into hiding. Stryker has managed to capture Xavier and will use him to create another version of cerebro. Wolverine and the team must now team up with their enemy, Magneto to stop Stryker before it's too late.When Bryan Singer brought us 'X-Men' back in 2000, it was a superhero comic book movie which the audience had not seen in a long time. For the sequel, 'X2', Singer has the opportunity to make it even better. He does this wonderfully. He has created another amazing story, which is much more interesting than the original film. Having humans as the enemies towards the mutants, give an interesting twist on the story. The special effects are amazing again, and so realistic. All the wonderful characters are back too, with more more action for characters such as Iceman and Pyro. Unfortunately, James Marsden gets a very small amount of screen time, which is a shame. Even if your not a comic book fan, you should try and give this ago. Even if you haven't seen the first film, this sequel is still easy to pick up.""We love what you've done with your hair."" - Magneto (Ian McKellen)","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Al_The_Strange","14 June 2014","The first X-Men film presented a grand cast of iconic heroes in a troubled world; their heroics would only become grander and more complex in the continuing conflict. Bryan Singer's second X-Men film carries over everything that made the first film great, and still manages to cram in a whole lot more.The action in X2 is phenomenal. The film starts off with one of the most elegantly-staged fight scenes on film. Shortly thereafter, the film rolls ahead with a constant series of fights and flights; among the most inspiring of scenes, Storm takes out a pair of jets with tornadoes, and Pyro goes berserk against a police squad. The entire last half of the film takes everybody to Alkali Lake, for a massive cascade of impressive action, including a great fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, Magneto wreaking havoc with the military, and Cyclops blowing things up. The whole time, all life on Earth remains at stake. It all reaches its apex with an awesome dam burst sequence, the likes of which could put the scenes in Superman: The Movie to shame.Despite having so much, the film never feels overblown or convoluted; it all flows very sublimely, and gives just enough room for the story to unfold and breathe a little. Characters shine a little better than before, and more attention is given to the lesser players. Some of the strongest moments include revelations concerning Wolverine's character. The film also digs up enough background on the villain, Colonel Stryker, and his situation to give the evil plot more relevance and depth. It all ties into the grander scheme of showing a world struggling against mutant prejudice, and thanks to the characters and their interactions, it remains a compelling struggle.This film is made with fantastic photography and editing. Acting is great from the whole cast: Hugh Jackman continues to excel as Wolverine, while Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Brian Cox, and everybody else remains solid. Writing is not bad. This production uses great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are generally good, but are aging a little. John Ottman's music score is great.X2 is a perfectly-balanced sequel with fantastic action scenes, but still gives a good amount of attention to the story and characters. In spite of this, it is a massive step up from the first film, and remains one of the best sequels since T2.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","magratk","5 March 2006","A wonderful movie about exclusion and alienation. With kick ass fight scenes. I'm a sucker for superheroes, and this move is crammed with them. And some of the best actors out there: Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen . . . man, I believed. The kick ass fight scenes did not hurt. The thing that is so marvelous about the X-Men is how redemptive it is. Many of us who were ever bullied as a child, all of us who have ever been oppressed and exploited want to rise up; want them to crawl at our feet. But it's not just about revenge fantasies, though the revenge fantasy was a major, major, component of this story. It's surprising subtle story about the line between revenge fantasies and building a just society. There was a whole lot of stuff going on. I'm no X-Men fangirl, but I've read a comic book now and again (at least the ones written by Joss Whedon) (everyone should read every thing ever written by Joss Whedon, btw) and I'm not sure I would have tracked what happened but for that. I work for a politician, and I love him. But man, I bought the venality of these political men. The metaphor of the dam finally breaking . . . wonderful. Cathartic, but also frighteningly Brechtian. The dam has broken, the long leashed waters unloosed, and we all have to live after the flood. Innocent or not. We still have to live in the world created by our ancestors. One of the best popular major motion pictures ever. Go see it. See it again. Go build a better world afterward.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","vidog316","4 May 2003","X2 is exactly what a sequel should be. It does not get caught up in the hype of audience anticipation or a huge budget to produce a special effect bonanza with no story. Instead, Bryan Singer remains with the excellent formula that made X-Men a great success. X2 remains a plot based movie that includes special effects and fight scenes only when needed. Everything that was established in X-Men is fed off of or improved upon in X2. Mystique plays a much more significant role in this movie compared to the originial. The story of William Stryker basically attemtping to detain and kill all mutants works much better than the original of Magneto attempting to turn humans into mutants. I cannot even begin to describe the amount of excitement I had coming into the movie, and the amount of joy and happiness I had coming out of it. Not only is it superior to the excellent original movie, but it is by far one of the best movies you will see all year. The sequences in between the fight scenes or action scenes are well developed and add a great deal of importance to the movie. Be sure to pay particular attention to the closing monologue, as well as the image emerging from the water. I have been told that that will have a significant impact on the events of X3. Great cast with Hugh Jackman and the absolutely gorgeous Famkee Janssen (more significant in this movie, although not much more screen time) leading the way. The new mutants are fabulous and Colossus and Wolverine's rampage through the Mutant Academy was one of the best scenes I have ever seen. High recommended10 out of 10","

I love them and passionately anticipate and enjoy most of the recent motion pictures based on them. DC and Dark Horse comics have always been my favorites, and aside from The Punisher and Ghost Rider, I do not care too much for Marvel. However, despite that, I enjoyed the original X-Men very much. I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation (see The Usual Suspects.) Yet, I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong, X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra, yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever, and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something, but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character, this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. I do highly recommend the original X-Men, but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, V For Vendetta, or Sin City.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Freycinet","4 May 2003","How could such a piece of drivel get such a high voting score at IMDB?This typical example of Hollywood's present-day empty-headedness has absolutely nothing going for it. Even compared to other superhero offerings it is disappointing.If lately you've had the experience of choosing a Hollywood blockbuster based on hype but no first-hand info from friends, and then left the theatre disappointed and sorry to have wasted your money, then... you'll have a pretty good idea of what you're in for.In X2 you'll be fleetingly presented with around ten superheroes, see them perform a trick or two each and then recede into well-deserved oblivion. You will also see a super-car and a super-plane. None of these entities will manage to awake any emotion whatsoever, since there simply isn't enough time to get acquainted with any of the multiple protagonists. Then again, that might not be so bad.The boring and unimaginitive script contains not a single instance of wit or humour. All is dead-serious and self-conscious, which is rather amazing given the sheer ridiculousness of the superheroes and their abilities. There are fleeting attempts at discussing the place of mutants (""illegal aliens""?) vs. humans in society, but these are halted and overshadowed by computer-generated tricks. The times when movies would only need a few of those to entertain audiences are over, but the makers of X2 didn't realise.
The film even manages to make Halle Berry look bad (white 1960's hair). Enough said.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Leofwine_draca","6 December 2016","This highly-promoted sequel was one of the summer blockbusters of 2003, but its hard to see what all the fuss was about. Sure, it's a fast-paced and interesting film, packed with absolutely brilliant special effects work, but really its much of the same and a storyline that doesn't add much to the X-Men mythos. Whilst I enjoyed the characterisation of leads Hugh Jackman (as particularly charismatic as ever) and Famke Janssen (the first film I haven't hated her in), the introduction of teenage leads such as Pyro is a definite pandering to younger teenage audiences. The storyline is all over the place, with lots of action and not much really happening; the set-piece finale takes place inside a huge dam which is about to break apart, and sometimes you feel like you've seen it all before.The action ranges from the ordinary to the very good. Pyro's display of his skills outside a suburban house is exceptional and the battle between Hugh Jackman and Kelly Hu is superb, and really nasty and violent despite the 12 certificate. One of the pluses is that this is a much more violent film than the first. The effects are decently done but the main characters don't go anywhere apart from through the old scenarios. It feels good to see Shakespearian stars Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen teamed up again, but you really wonder what they are doing here other than picking up a pay cheque. Brian Cox turns in a decent villain but he's somewhat wasted in an otherwise predictable movie which doesn't really have a storyline. Watchable but definitely not worth it a second time around.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","gcsman","8 April 2018","In the X-Men comics, the Jean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix sequence originally from the 1970's and 80's was one of the all-time great storylines in all of comics history. In fact, it's still going, because Marvel realized (somewhat too late) just how powerful that theme was with the fans. The echos and spinoffs from the Phoenix saga have kept resonating through all the X-Men titles with follow-on characters like the post-Phoenix real Jean Grey (in the long-running X-Factor series), her apparent clone Madelyne Pryor (whom Scott Summers married when Jean was MIA and presumed dead, had a son with, then separated), Rachel Grey/Summers (the daughter of Jean and Scott from an alternate timeline), and ongoing conflicts between Scott and Wolverine, Jean's two lovers. And the Phoenix entity itself keeps showing up, once in a while. Jean herself has been put through a confusing near-endless cycle of death/resurrection/Phoenix re-animation, though it seems unlikely any of these would make it into the movies, since the X-films have now defined a path of their own.According to screenwriter Zak Penn, the original concept for the movie X2 (X-Men United) was to go all the way into the Phoenix story, but he persuaded director Bryan Singer to hold back on it till the X-Men movie world was more well established. On its own merit I'd say that was a wise move; it's just that in X3 (2006) under different director Brett Ratner, they actually did go into Phoenix and messed it up. However, hope springs eternal. We'll see what the new Dark Phoenix (2019) has to show us next year with the rebooted younger X-Men cast. Fingers crossed.Anyway, in X2 we just get three short moments when the Phoenix entity makes its appearance within Jean as a sort of prelude, but they're exciting moments in themselves and a key to the big climactic scene that is the payoff to the whole movie. From the moment of its theater release (2003) X2 has been one of my favorite movies, let alone superhero movies. And I'll say that a rating of 10/10 doesn't mean 'perfect', which as far as I'm concerned can't be defined for films; it just reflects how I feel about it. I watched this again on DVD just this week and it still holds up very well against all the other movies in this now-big genre. My ""top 5"" list of all-time best superhero flicks right now is (no particular order) X2, Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, and Wonder Woman. What do they have in common? The answer isn't great special effects, although they all have that. It's (a) storyline and (b) characters that we care about, just like in any good movie of any genre. X2 from 15 years back is the oldest of these. Its special effects are just fine for what it needs, but the point is that it does NOT rely on its big action sequences as its whole reason for being. It's what happens BETWEEN those action set pieces that matters: the story, the characters, the dialog. If those are good, then you've got something that lasts. After the success of the first X-Men (2000) we eagerly looked forward to the second instalment with anticipation and a bit of anxiety: would it be as good? maybe even better? It delivered, and that was important: the whole idea of the superhero genre was very new then and its eventual success was not at all guaranteed. The familiar X-people were back, the key actors were more comfortable with their roles, and the new people (Nightcrawler, Pyro, and brief bits by Colossus and Shadowcat) fitted in well -- the opening scene of the movie where Nightcrawler blitzes the White House guards to get to the president is one of the great introductions to a character who's going to play a substantial role in the rest of the movie.The X-Men franchise has had some distinctive things going for it compared with the MCU. Right from the start, it's had something closer to gender parity with Storm, Jean, Mystique, Rogue all having strong roles. (And X2 easily passes the Bechdel test: as an example, see the scenes between Jean and Storm when they go off to track down Nightcrawler.) This is ground that the MCU still hasn't covered 15 years later. Another strong point is that the dialog and direction of the X-films doesn't rely on Joss Whedon-like self-referential humor, irony, or snark. Those have their place -- at Whedon's best, it's brilliant -- but at times it's just nice to watch something that takes itself seriously and where the issues feel real. Wonder Woman (2017) fits that category, too.On repeated viewings of X2, though, you really start to admire the structure of the plot -- its complex web of interlocking storylines and characters, and the patient way in which it all unfolds until everything finally comes together in the last half-hour. Just about every piece of the web that appears in the first half of the film, large or small, gets used in the second half. If your movie is just a framework for running from one action scene to another for the sake of eye candy, you can't do that. Who is actually the central character, among this big cast and complex story? Logan (Hugh Jackman) is the center of a sub-plot about uncovering his own origin, but he's not at the epicenter of the entire film. Magneto (Ian McKellen) is in a lot of scenes and is the leader of a sort of parallel attack on Stryker, but again no. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is MIA in the middle of the film (again!) and surprisingly we hardly notice. As I hinted above, this movie belongs to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). On a second or third viewing, you can see the ending coming in what happens with Jean throughout the film (including, especially, the first appearances of the immensely powerful Phoenix force within her). And it's the last 15 minutes that lift this movie from good to great. Jean's heartrending, fully self-aware sacrifice allows all the rest of the team to survive, along with the mutant kids rescued from the evil Stryker's clutches. Greater love hath no man. The emotional kick of this scene is doubled by the grief pouring out from Scott and Logan, who both desperately loved her in different ways. Not that there aren't other good action sequences at well calibrated intervals. There's the visit of Bobby, Rogue, Pyro, and Wolverine to Bobby's parents' house (where we get the best line of the film from Bobby's mother, ""Have you tried ... not being a mutant?), which goes sideways when the police arrive. There's the Blackbird chase by two fighter planes, with the moment when the Phoenix force first pops up; the all-out violence of the fight between Wolverine and Deathstryke; and the extended battle within the giant hydropower dam-turned-lab. But again, it's what happens between these that is important. The characters develop, interact, grow, and end up different people than they started.It was a letdown that X3 (2006) couldn't continue the string. The franchise wouldn't rise to these heights again until Days of Future Past (2014). We'll see what next year's Dark Phoenix has to bring. The storyline is still begging for a good treatment.(A footnote: Jean Grey is a puzzingly colorless name (no pun intended) given that it's from Stan Lee himself, that lovable promoter and genius behind the Marvel superhero universe. Stan came up with loads of strong and/or alliterative names for his comics characters like Susan Storm; Peter Parker; Jessica Jones; Luke Cage; Ororo Munroe; Scott Summers; Rogue; Reed Richards; Ben Grimm; Stephen Strange; Nick Fury; and dozens more. Why something so ordinary?)","

It seems like the producers were more concerned with casting names than with making the stories and characters work. Heck, they even hired Alan Cumming for some reason (though he does alright all things considered).And of of now (2015), they keep making these X-Men movies.

But there were also a lot of garbage : iceman, storm, phoenix effect, Pyro, cyclopsÂ If the production is splendid and the effects rather well done, the movie never really takes off. Maybe it's the editing, maybe Stryker is a poor choice of villain, maybe it's much too dark or the fact that their mutants powers are rather invisible but at the end, it was not really enjoyable.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tburke85","19 May 2009","I thought this one of those rare sequels that was actually much better improvement over the first one but there were some flaws. The film is no Dark Knight or Spider-man 2 but I'd say that it's just as good as either Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. Bryan Singer does an admirable job with this sequel giving the audiences some more interesting characters (but it can feel a bit much at times) and just enough exhilarating sci-fi action. Singer improves on some of the flaws in the first one but some are still in the sequel but the good outweighs the bad. The cast are great in their roles including Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, Ian McKellen as Eric Lesherr/Magento, Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe/Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Phoenix), James Marsden as Scott Summers/Cyclops, Rebecca Romijin Stamos as Mystique, and Anna Paquin Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue. Joining the cast are Brian Cox as one of the villains Colonel William Striker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike, and Alan Cumming as Kurt Warner/Nightcrawler. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their roles but unfortunately they don't get a lot of screen time and aren't developed either. Magneto, Mystique, Striker, and Deathstrike prove to be effective villains. But how many villains can you have in one movie? Other than Deathstrike not being in it much and having almost no dialogue. The actors and actresses bring a lot to their roles no matter how big or small it may be. On the side of good Wolverine, Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler prove to be believable heroes in the imaginary world they inhabit where mutants and humans are trying to co-exist. Some of the flaws in the last film are in this one as well like the fact that they still seem to be juggling too many characters (Colossus, Jubilee, and Kitty Pride have nothing more than brief cameos). Patrick Stewarts Charles Xavier and James Marsden's Cyclops also seemed to have less screen time than they did in the first film as well. Cyclops disappears for a large parts of the movie (like Xavier) only to show up near the end. The other supporting characters including Iceman and Pyro have bigger roles that some of the others but they still lack screen time. Bruce Davison also returns for a brief blink and you missed it appearance as Senator Kelly from the first film (He's actually Mystique because his character died in the first X-Men). With it's flaws aside X-Men United is still definitely a much better improvement over it's predecessor and is an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. From it's incredible opening sequence involving a teleporting Nightcrawler to it's emotional climax involving the possible death of a major character X-Men United has plenty action, suspense, thrills, drama, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Michael Heide","24 April 2003","X-Men 2 had everything a comic book adaption needs. A strong story not just rehashing old plots from the comic, great actors and exciting special effects. Plus, it had tons of references to the comics only insiders get (Remy LeBeau and Franklin Richards are mentioned, one Dr. Hank McCoy appears in an interview).Let's start with the story. I'm trying to keep this mostly spoiler-free. After an assassination attempt on the US President, Vietnam veteran William Stryker appears in the Oval Office, asking to take out a training camp for mutant terrorists. Said training camp is the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters. Those who watched the first movie or are familiar with the comic books know that this is the headquarters of the X-Men, mutants who protect a world that hates and fears them for being different. The problem is, most of the X-Men are away when he strikes, leaving the mansion (and Cerebro, a device with which you can track every mutant on the planet and, if you are telepathically skilled enough, kill them) vulnerable...When the first movie was an analogy to the Black Rights movement (with Xavier and Magneto standing for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, respectively), this is a movie about homosexuals. One mother asks her child if he hasn't tried ""not being a mutant"", and another man demands Professor Xavier ""heals"" his son, a mutant. Nightcrawler asks Mystique why she doesn't blend in with the ""normal"" people, and when she replies that she doesn't think mutants have to blend in, it's clear what this movie is about. People have to accept what they are. No one has to hide because he's different. And the rest has to respect that decision, has to tolerate those who are born different. And this is what makes this movie so important.While the first X-Men movie featured mainly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), this one is an ensemble movie. With the single exception of Cyclops, everyone gets their great moment to shine, especially the youngsters (Rogue, Iceman, Pyro) are convincing. Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler is great, but he speaks a horrible German. Well, at least that's true to the comics.All in all, this is a great movie with a surprising ending, but it leaves me with some kind of dilemma. On the one hand, I want Bryan Singer to continue making movies for the X-Men franchise. But on the other hand, although X-Men 2 is the best superhero-comicbook-adaption ever (beating even Richard Donner's Superman), it's still nowhere near The Usual Suspects...","

However, later, I took its DVD and watched it again, completely changed my mind. X-2 is as entertaining as the first one and again with great, amazing action scenes. Plus, the movie is deeper, more powerful than the first one owing to the brilliant script. The opening sequence of the movie is one of the best opening sequences so far. However, one of my favorite parts, may be favorite part is the assault sequence. It is spectacular, not showy. Especially editing and sound editing are great and to me it deserves to be included in cinema anthology, at least action cinema anthology. I like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, but whatever he does, he cannot be as tough as the original character, in other words, he does not look like a threat. Sorry, but Brian Cox's William Stryker is much more better than Danny Huston's William Stryker. The man with the wheel chair must be one of the most important characters of X-Men myth, but I did not know this character, still I don't know, I haven't searched, so I cold not understand that part exactly. The cell of Magneto recalls the cell of Hannibal Lecter obviously. The plan of him and Mystique was probably one of the most smart plans in cinema. As for the X-jet sequence, like the assault part, it deserves to be included in the bests. Except Behind Enemy Lines, the greatest 'jet' sequence is here. Spectacular and especially sound editing is great. Twister moments were unbelievable. Wolverine Deathstrike fight is very harsh (as I know, because of the complaints of the fans, Singer made fights more tough) but a bit exaggerating and showy. However, there are more amazing scenes, more action and sub stories in the movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","jboothmillard","1 July 2005","If you have seen the first film, or you like to read the comics about the bunch of mutant super heroes, then this sequel is better than the first film. It has more interest, more action and obviously more interesting mutants. Basically William Stryker (Brian Cox) wants to eliminate all the mutants, even though they are already a threat to society, also he wants to see his creation again, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is sending the X-Men team to try and stop this. Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) with the gorgeous Mystique/Grace (Rebecca Romijn) do join the good side for a while, but mainly he wanted to escape and almost gets what he wants in the next film. The film reunites Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, the character should have stayed dead), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) and Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin). It also introduces Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). Very good!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Bergmaniac","16 July 2004","X-2 is alongside the first batman movie in a class of its own compared to all the others comic book movies out there. It has smart script that doesn't make you groan because of the stupidity of the screenwriters half the time as most of the other superhero movies do. It's really entertaining, lots of humor, magnificent fighting scenes(the opening sequence will forever remain a classic in that department IMO - astonishing combination of creative special effects, fight choreography and totally fitting great classical music), actors who  are really good and concentrated on their job(especially Ian McKellen, who is once again awesome as Magnetto) and even some actual message behind all the fights and superpowers, that really works. It also has what is always most important for a good movie and that's a smart director who knows his job. Bryan Singer is showing his talent here, getting good performances from all of his actors despite the CGI scenes being aplenty(but they are  really well done, much better than Spiderman 2 for example) and also creating a visual feast and an unique feel to the movie. And I've never even read the comics before, but I really felt close to the characters and easily got engaged in the X-Men universe. Lastly, but definitely not least important, is the fact that this movie has one of the greatest looking female cast ever assembled in a mainstream movie. Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and the ultra-gorgeous Rebecca Romijn Stamos(who even has a short, but memorable appearance without the blue paint that goes with her Mystique part) - it doesn't get better than that. And all those lovely ladies can act pretty well too. Not that their parts were difficult, of course, but in comparison with the pathetic failures we so often see by the pretty actresses in the blockbuster movies it's really refreshing to watch a bunch of pretty women who can act decently enough. I highly recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It's even better than the excellent first part.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","carologletree","22 July 2017","""X-Men 2"" is one of several Marvel movies that is an improvement over its predecessor. Whereas the first film felt held back a little, this sequel is much more confident and polished.Hugh Jackman is once again fantastic as Logan/Wolverine. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are their usual great selves. Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm all return from the first film and are more fleshed out this time around. I also liked Rogue a lot more than in the first one.We get a few more characters spotlighted, such as Pyro and Ice Man. The stand-out is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler; he is one of the coolest characters in the entire franchise. We also get a wonderful villain in William Stryker, played by Brian Cox.The film has a great storyline that hints more of Wolverine's past and brings up many interesting themes. It also has bigger, better action sequences than the first one with the best one being the brutal fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. The music score is once again really good.My only real issues are that the film is just a little too long and what lead to Jean Grey's death felt a bit weird (I understand why it had to happen, though).This was a great sequel that builds and improves upon its predecessor like any sequel should. This is one of the best ""X-Men"" movies and one of the better superhero movies out there.RATING: A-","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","CrassActionHero","24 September 2006","X2 (2003) We all wonder about that old saying, are sequels better than the first? Most of the time, no. However this time, yep. Better. Far better.X2 has what X-Men did not, character development. despite being introduced to so many new mutants, we learn about them and their personality. We learn more about Wolverine who has a clue about his past that is more complicated than ever. Who is he? What happened? We meet another mew one in Pyro. He seems a little cocky and explains his unique power. Another(and personal favorite)is Nightcrawler. He nearly assassinated the president and has no idea why he attempted something like that. The fights at the white house were spectacular to behold. The visuals alone will no doubt keep you entertained.We still don't know much about Mystique but she does show a little character and is used much better here. The turn of events in the movie force the X-Men to unite with the Brotherhood to stop a problem that is calculating and cold.Enter William Stryker. A mystery himself. Played by Brian Cox, expect a good performance no doubt. He is rather sadistic and has a purpose and will do anything to fulfill that agenda. Anything.The only drawbacks here is that Cyclops is M.I.A. though a lot of the movie, and Lady Deathstrike. Well casted by Kelly Hu is naturally awesome, but has no dialog at all. No story. Monster disappointment.X2 is certainly better than X-Men. The battles here are far superior than the first. the special FX are awesome, and character development is here! The Last Word: X2 is awesome. What the first movie lacked, this one gave us that and then some. The only thing keeping this from a ten is the lack of development for Cyclops and Lady Deathstrike.(especially Deathstrike) Although not perfect(but damn close), X2 rocked! Recommended.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","peter-c-odlaug","1 May 2003","There will be some spoilers so be warned. After watching the movie I have to say that I was greatly impressed by the entire movie.  The special effects, the additional mutant schoolchildren, the story line and acting are all on a par high above the first X-Men movie. Not to say the first movie wasn't great but with the world of the movie already set up, X2 is able to launch itself into action more quickly.The special effects and make-up are extremely well done and there are a lot more than the first X-Men movie most likely due to the fact that it is a ""sequel"" but they still don't overshadow the story-line and the actors.Speaking of the actors, Sir Ian McKellen outshines the entire cast, obviously revelling in his role of Magneto.  His costume is improved as is the design of his helmet and he gets to show off more of his power than he did in the first X-Men movie.   Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Cyclops once again have a strained friendship due to both of their affections for Jean Grey but they manage to get over it at the end, as they are made to by circumstances beyond their control.Halle Berry's Storm is improved from the first movie as well, given more of a role to play and Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler/Kurt Wagner is outstanding. The teleportation effect is extremly well done which adds to his character.And of course there is Brian Cox's character William Striker.  Although a slightly sad character due to his past with his wife and son, Striker is an evil and very manipulative man and wants something to be done for him by Prof. Xavier but I won't say what.X2 is a very worthy ""sequel"" to add to the X-Men mantle and is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the comics, the first movie or someone who is just is search of an entertaining, extreamly well done superhero movie.","

Despite an exciting opening featuring a mysterious assailant in The White House, the movie soon becomes a tired, plodding affair with little to engage the viewer, despite some impressive visuals.The film fails to create any genuine excitement and the high calibre cast is wasted in this big budget offering from Bryan Singer.The appeal of this movie is simply lost on me.6 out of 10. A few big bangs and an ""A List"" cast is simply not enough to warrant over two hours of screen time. Absolutely average at best - if I'd paid money to watch this at the cinema, I'd have been even more critical.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","0w0","3 August 2020","This movie has a couple of plot-holes, but the biggest of which is that Mercury (the element), is completely non-magnetic AND mercury can be detected by a metal detector. If the movie avoided those 2 plot-holes and took them into consideration instead, then this film would have been quite different. The fact that they allowed these two plot-holes is a sign that they either didn't care about being scientifically correct, or that they simply were too lazy to avoid plot-holes like this and just took the easy way out when they were writing the plot of the movie.Anyway, besides those issues, the film is OK. It could easily have been an 8/10 film if they took these plot-holes into consideration or if they actually cared about the canon of the X-Men franchise, but instead it results in an OK 7/10 rating.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","bimetale","10 July 2003","So many rave reviews that I just have to add my bit, cause frankly : I *didn't* like it. Okay, so Matrix was not adapted from a comic book. Still, it is clearly a comic-book film : exact same style, approach, feel and substance. It *could have been a comic*, and a good one at that! Another thing : I never was a fan of the original X-Men comic. Then again, ol' Supes or Batman never gave me shivers either, and still I loved the first Superman and Batman movies, so that don't mean a thing. So : what's so wrong with this movie? Well, basically, I think it's just... DUMB. Yeah, that's the word : dumb! The scenario, and everybody in it is just so dumb it makes you cry. Hell, with prof. X's supapowers and Cerebro, I'd have fixed the Magneto problem in no time! Being Magneto and having co-designed the thing, I would have killed all those pesky norms in a sec too (which it is clearly able to do according to the film)! And then the army guy... with an asset like Mastermind, couldn't he really think of a more, well, intelligent way of fighting the mutants? Well of course, he *is* an army dude so maybe that's asking too much. And then the regular guys, like in the scene where Pyro blows up a load of cop cars, ""You heard about those big bad mutants guys?""-style : being one of the soldiers, I would go like, ""**BANG** - Yeah, I heard. I also heard most of you guys aren't BULLET PROOF!!!"". That's one more thing : haven't they invented the gun yet in the X-Men universe? Most of the mutants are not power-protected in  any way from bullets (except when Magneto's around of course), still none of them ever seems to think of wearing some Kevlar, let alone a *gun*. So, okay, I know it might have been a problem in the comic because of CCA regulations, but still, couldn't they have changed that for the movie just to make it less dumb? It would change the whole dynamic of the thing. So, are there qualities redeeming the lack of basic intelligence throughout the movie? Not many... most of Wolverine's dry humor is gone, and Wolverine as a character seems less interesting than in the first X (though this does not seem to be a problem with the acting - see below). The fight scenes are just boring, sometimes even offensively so (Deathstryke could have killed Wolverine a thousand times in that fight, and still she lost it in the lamest manner imaginable - what a bummer). The other action scenes don't get a lot better (that plane chase for instance - there were a thousand ways they could have made that one tons more exciting than by just using YASP, Yet Another SuperPower). The acting is very good for some, awful for others. Ian McKellen shines, as always : I bet he could even make a Coca Cola ad look exciting.  Patrick Stewart also does a very good job at it - he really CAN do something more than Trek, and I really look forward to seeing him in better fares than this. And Hugh Jackman is still a good Wolverine, though he didn't get half the chances to show it that he got in the first movie. Even Romijn-Stamos did a pretty good job, a lot better than in the previous film. The rest of the acting though ranged from the simply lame to the excruciatingly bad. Nightcrawler made me crawl up the walls, but not in the funny way it was clearly intended. And finally, there is  the whole soap-factor : who isn't having an affair with whom in this movie? I remember this being one of the things that hit my crap-o-meter in the comics too - but just because it's crap that's in the comic, that don't mean you have to keep that crap for the movie! All in all, I feel like this movie could have been a lot better, which is a pity. I had a negative feeling about the first X movie as well, but the more I thought about it and the more I saw it, the better it became. In the end, it finished about side-by-side with the original Matrix movie. X2 started out as just boring in my book, however : it only got worse each time I thought back about it, and the second sitting of it was just torture. This movie will be a must for lovers of the X-Men comic as it quite faithfully reproduces its feel, all of the crap in the original books included. For those who do not fall into that category however, go see Reloaded, or if you have already, go see it a second time : you will be the better for it.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","war_cat2","12 May 2003","First and foremost, I thought the first X-Men was an average to dull movie and it in no way merited a sequel.  Hollywood of course has different agendas.  This sequel is horrible.  The first 30 mins of the movie move along rather well and have some nice special effects, but that is where the fun stops.  The last hour is so drawn out and boring that I and my co-watcher were nodding off at times.  The plot is bad, and the script is poorly written.  Can anyone answer me these 2 questions?  (1) Why is it ok to kill off goverment soldiers, but it is not Ok to kill police officers? For some reason no police officers were hurt during the filming of this movie, there faces however were covered in soot from exploding cars 1ft from them.  Meanwhile army special ops soldiers were gutted left and right with no limbs spared.  (2) Why can this band of mutants accomplish incredible feats time & time again without fail, but when faced of the task of trying to avoid a wall of water closing in on there location with 30 mins to act the best solution they can come up with is to sit in a broken down state of the art 'mutant' jet (which for some reason has no ejection seats) and look dumbfounded? WTF? And people are raving about this pile of junk.  The damn teleportin' crawler could have teleported them all 1 by 1 to a nearby mountain top in 5 secs. Nice script writing.  I can not believe this movie is going to inherit yet another sequel. Tragedy at it's finest.  There was two awesome things about the movie though that I forgot. The preview for 28 Days Later, and the preview for Matrix 2.  I'm out.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","StuHolmwood","6 May 2003","Women loved this film. I am not a woman, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. As I watched the film, however, I did remark a large step foreward in the role of the female super hero, and I think this is perhaps why women liked this film (besides that I'm told Wolverine is hot).Traditionally, as with the Sorceress in ""Heman"", female superheros have power not because of physical strength, but because of some abstract or arcane power. This, symbolically, says that men are stronger than women, and women need to use some intangible power (be it intellect or sex appeal) to garner power.The fight scene with Wolverine and the evil assistant in the adimantium laboratory changes all this. Wolverine, the macho man of the X-men, is severely beaten by a woman in a purely physical contest. There are no spin kicks, no spells, no potions, and no cleavage distractions. This is a fair contest with equal weapons, and it was well done to boot. Granted, he wins in the end, but he bleeds buckets.Marvel comics, thus, has attracted women to a genre which is stigmatized as being male dominated. The boys with their kung fu grip Skeletor no longer reign in the comic book movie industry - way to go girls.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","kylehodgdon","11 November 2009","This X-Men movie is great from beginning to end. The story was great, the fights were perfect, the characters were interesting, everything had a purpose, and it left you wanting more. This being a sequel definitely had an advantage over the first in the series due to the fact that the characters did not have to be introduced. Instead, the main arc of the story could take off right from the get go. Nightcrawler looks great and they did a wonderful job with the CGI of his teleportation ability. One of the only problems with this movie is that there are so many characters for a two hour film that all could not be included. Instead of having something going on, Cyclops had to spend most of the movie knocked out somewhere. I know I'm in the minority here, but personally I could have watched a four hour movie with a grandiose story which included all characters containing sub-stories for each to be occupied with. But I definitely know that most people have no desire to watch an extra long X-Men movie like that.I did enjoy ""The Last Stand"" a bit more than ""X2"", but that is by a very small margin. Both movies are terrific and worth seeing.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","theclash_classicrock","27 June 2005","I love comic books. Ever since I was a little kid I would watch the TV cartoons with my brother, and read his old comic books. X-Men has always been my favorite, and, of course, Wolverine was always my favorite character. I understand there were a few things ""wrong"" with this movie. For example, Lady Deathstrike's background was not explained at all. But, overall I think they handled this movie wonderfully. I adored the first X-Men, but I absolutely LOVED this one. I think X-Men is probably a more difficult comic book movie to tackle because of all the characters. One must try and develop several heroes as apposed to just one or two. I think, for the most part, they did a wonderful job with this. A lot of people complain that too much time is spent on Wolverine, and not the other characters. However, this is the correct way to go. Wolverine is, by far, the most popular of all the X-Men, so in order to appeal to the masses they must focus on him. He also has a more complicated and interesting past than most of the others. He is probably the closest one can get to a ""main"" character in X-Men. Wolverine, is probably going to get his own Spin-off movie, so this might help. I think Hugh Jackman (apart from his height) is the perfect Wolverine. Anyone who thinks he overacts this part obviously knows nothing about Wolverine or the X-Men series.I would, however, like to see more time spent on Storm. I would also like to see Rogue get the rest of her kick-ass powers so she can start kicking people's asses, as she is supposed to do. Personally, I would like to do away with Iceman, Jean Gray, and Cyclops altogether, but I have never been a fan of theirs. But, I know that isn't possible. :P To be fair, they did a great job portraying their characters, and I know the story wouldn't be near as interesting without them. (I was pleased to find out that Cyclops will probably be getting a smaller role in X3 because the actor is also filming Superman around the same time. *wink*) Everyone else, I am pretty satisfied with. I have been happy to hear that Halle Berry will probably not be seen in the next installment (personally, I think this ""I'm too good for you"" Oscar brat needs to get out of this picture). Unfortunately, Alan will not be returning either, and neither will Nightcrawler (at least that is what I have heard). However much I like Nightcrawler he is not really a primary character, so maybe this move will be okay. I would really like to see Gambit and Beast in X3! I think that covers the good guys. :)As for the bad guys, I can never argue with Ian McKellen. He is the perfect Magneto, and I was pleased to hear that they will be doing a spin-off on Magneto as well. He is my second favorite character. I find him very fascinating as well, and I think he deserves a film about him as a young man. Mystique, was great as well. I like how they started to intertwine her feelings for Logan. I think Pyro was sufficiently evil, and he will be a joy to watch in the next movie. Stryker was also great and he built a lot of tension to Wolverine's story. I saw recently that the girl who played Lady Death Strike has signed on for X3, which makes me believe that they may explore her past and who she is in relation to Wolverine. Exciting!I can't wait for X3! I think the X-Men series has been the greatest of any comic book movie series, but then again, I am partial. Still, it is worth seeing! :)","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","PassPopcorn","23 May 2014","The first X-Men movie was, in a way, a revolutionary movie. It was, more or less, considered a low budget movie and nevertheless it managed to earn a ton of money, making way for future movies. Not only did the movie turn out to be a huge financial success, but it was also quite a decent superhero movie which managed to perfectly combine action and drama. After the first movie's financial boom and positive critical reception, a sequel was bound to happen. 'X2â² was a much bigger movie then its predecessor â it had a bigger budget ($110 million), it earned more money (over $400 million) and was overall a better movie.The movie opens with a mutant, later identified as the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempting to assassinate the President of the USA. This failed assassination triggers a harsh human response against the mutants, and the Presidents goes with the plan of one William Stryker (Brian Cox), an army colonel who wants to storm Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for Gifted Youngsters. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) wants to learn more about his past, and Magneto (Ian McKellen) is still in his plastic prison, but Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) has her own plans for busting him out.'X2â² is the ideal example of a sequel done right. The movie contains everything which made the first one good (the social commentary, the acting, the memorable characters), and it upgrades some things that didn't really work in the first one (some of the dialogue, Halle Berry has a significantly smaller role), but still has a voice of its own. There are several newcomers to the franchise who are properly introduced and developed throughout the movie, but the one who stands out the most is Brian Cox as the movie's villain, William Stryker. Cox, aided by two other veteran actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen), makes for one impressive triumvirate of actors. This movie is worth seeing because of acting alone, but when you add to that the great fighting sequences, the amazing set pieces and strong writing â you get one really remarkable superhero movie.'X2â² is not only better and bigger than its predecessor, but it's also 30 minutes longer, which may be its biggest problem. Not that the movie is boring, but there are so many subplots in the movie that 'X2â² sometimes feels like two movies crammed in one, thus being somewhat overcrowded (especially in its third act). Nonetheless, 'X2â² is still an impressive entry in the genre of superhero movie and the whole X-men franchise. Unfortunately, right after this movie, things went south for the X-men franchise.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/","

Everyone shines as the story becomes the star of the movie from the opening scene. Watch how the writers keep some characters a question. For instance, what was Nightcrawler's motivation for attacking the president? Loved the oepning scene, by the way.The movie is beautifully shot. Magneto's escape. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike and I particularly love Mystique's agility when she takes out those military men in a heartbeat.Anna Paquin is very attractive as Rogue, she is one woman who I can say does not have fabricated beauty. The pacing might falter at times but I love how the writers get to show each character's superpower and incorporate it with the action in the story.John Ottman's score sucked though.A-","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","spunky-22","4 May 2003","I just got back to my apartment after seeing this movie, and I'm still on a high from it.  I think this sequel gets that rare distinction of being better than the first.  Everything was right on target with this movie. Since there were fewer character introductions, the audience is treated with a much faster paced movie with more action and even more impressive special effects.  I don't want to go into detail so as not to ruin anything for those who haven't seen the movie.  On that note, I must say the trailers of this movie were excellent by virtue of the fact that there was plenty to see in the movie that was not in the trailers.  Anyway, back to the actual movie...  If you're a fan of the comics, you will really enjoy this movie. It has plenty of plot turns that remind you of why you love the comics so much.  I'd like to keep this vague since one of my favorite things about X2 is that I had (purposely) known very little about it prior to seeing it.  So go see it now.  I mean it...NOW!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Chiron1987","5 May 2003","X2: X-Men United is Bryan Singer's franchise's The Empire Strikes Back. It actually and successfully builds upon and surpasses its 2000 predecessor, and that is a feat in of itself.X2 picks up right where the previous X-Men film leaves off, and never stops for a second.  It contains all of the elements of a hard sci-fi film, action-adventure, and poignant drama, and somehow, pulls it all off.Hugh Jackman returns as the stalwart Logan, AKA Wolverine, still on the search for his past.  This collides with the appearance of Nazi-esque military scientist Colonel William Stryker, portrayed delectably by Brian Cox, who wants to infiltrate the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, and rend mutantkind asunder.  All of our previous players have returned, yet in beefed up, fleshed-out roles.  And somehow, Singer and Co. have been enable to inject further characters, such as Aaron Stamford's manic and morose Pyro and Shawn Ashmore's earnest Iceman.  The true stand-out is Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, alias Nightcrawler, a young man who is committed to his Christian faith but is cursed to live life looking like a blue demon. Kurt's pain, but upbeat attitude towards forgiveness, makes him an incredibly realistic character.  Cumming's scenes with Halle Berry's redeemed Storm are terrific and heartfelt.And let us not forget our villains.  Along with the aforementioned Col. Stryker, Sir Ian McKellen's Magneto returns, as does Rebecca Stamos' Mystique.  McKellen chews up the scenery and naturally, delivers some of the best lines in the film, but Stamos' Mystique's part is extended and magnified, giving us a better picture at this deadly, although conflicited, femme fatale.It was a shear pleasure to see the introduction of one of my favorite X-Men, the long lamented Colossus, played here with enormous physicality by newcomer Daniel Cudmore.  Colossus is not seen much, but when he is, the audience is transfixed by his awesome metallic form.  Here's hoping we hear and see more from the armored X-Man-in-training in the future.Patrick Stewart wears the Professor X role much like his immaculate suits: perfectly.  The role was his to take and he it has enveloped him nearly as well as his previous Capt. Picard role from Star Trek: The Next Generation and its subsequent feature films.  Professor X comes off as the loving instructor and mentor, but his mind-manipulation ability appears frightening in the context of X2.  We truly learn that Charles Xaxier is the Earth's most powerful mutant...and perhaps, man.Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen shine, as always, as Wolverine and Jean Grey. Jackman owns the role of Logan, and we even get well-received glimpses of Wolverine's ""berzerker"" behavior.  Janssen, and this is SPOILER MATERIAL, is the biggest surprise of X2.  Her revelation of the emerging ability to manipulate the star-wide Phoenix Force, is a great surprise for the long-time comic book fans.  However, her self-sacrifice and apparent ""death"" were huge shocks.  Yet, as the film ends, we glimpse through Professor Xavier's mind's eye, and see that Jean will return, but most likely, will never be the same.James Marsden's Cyclops is a delight, as always, but unfortunately, and this is my only gripe, is in the film very little.  However, his short scenes are so densely packed with drama and emotion, fans of Scott Summers will be forgiving.  And besides, if there is an X-Men 3, and God willing, there will be, with Jean Grey's likely return, Cyclops must take a central role in a possible ""Phoneix/Dark Phoneix"" storyline.You cannot see X2 once.  There is too much on screen to be viewed, and potentially missed.  For comics fans, there are plenty of Easter Eggs and little hidden secrets, and unless you're a mutant, you cannot catch them all.  So, see it again if you can, and take along a loved one.  X2 is one film you must not miss.Marvel Comics' cinematic triumphs continue to build and amaze.  If Warner Bros. had learned long ago that in order to make successful, well-received films featuring their trademark D.C. Comics superhero characters you must employ the best talent who treat the characters honestly and with reverence, we might not have had a glut of terrible Superman and Batman movies.  And while the Marvel train chugs along, Warner Bros. mires itself in self-doubt and second-guessing, leaving the fans out there with the question of whether we'll ever see another GOOD Superman or Batman film ever again.Highest recommendation!","

From the get go, there's plenty of action, suspense and excitement (with a few twists to boot). Although the characters started in comic books, this has more the feel of a graphic novel (definitely not for children). There were many new characters introduced - all extremely well done, some left you wanting to see more of them. I can't wait for a third installment of this series.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","TxMike","14 March 2004","Even though I was not a reader of X-Men comics, I grew up reading action comics in the 1950s, and I enjoy most any comic-book inspired movie. Like the first X-Men movie, or Batman, Superman, Spiderman, and Shadow movies. This one, 'X2', is no exception. From the opening sequence, threatening the President of the USA, to the final scenes, the action, sound, and special effects are highly entertaining. Just simple escapism entertainment. I own the DVD, and will view it more than once.SPOILERS follow, don't read any further, OK!?  The premise here is that an evil scientist is out to destroy all mutants, and to do that he gains mind control of some which allows him to have plans stolen for the chamber where Dr X can use his mind to track down people. Since this threatens both the good and the bad mutants, they band together to defeat this plot. All the mutants get to show off their unique powers.","

To blame for the deed are a teleporting mutant Nightcrawler(Alan Cummings)and a band of Ninja-like commandos. Trying to locate the dastardly Nightcrawler becomes a problem for Xavier(Patrick Stewart), so he is forced to seek enlightenment from his foe Magneto(Ian McKellan), who is still imprisoned in his glass/heavy plastic cell. Meanwhile, Wolverine is 'babysitting' for some young mutant students when the mansion is overrun with unfriendly visitors. The X-Men finding the Nightcrawler may just lead them to the cause of this chaos, William Stryker(Brian Cox), a villainous governmental figure that seams to be the menace of every mutant and possibly all of mankind. Nothing like a big job for a group of superheroes...the X-Men.Just as special as the original.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","view_and_review","31 January 2007","""X2"" was considerably better than the first. I believe that it being better had more to do with a bigger budget than anything else. They obviously put more into the CGI and special effects to show off the X-Men abilities (I mean why else are we watching it?). After the opening scene I knew I was in for a fantastic treat. The movie starts with an awesome display of Nightcrawler's abilities. The camera perfectly captured Nightcrawler teleporting from point to point to just absolutely dismantle the secret service. It was a supreme use of CGI and stunts to make a spine tingling good scene. The story in X2 was good as well, it stayed true to the comic book and the constant battle between homo-sapiens and homo-superior (humans and mutants). We got to see more mutants and a better display of their skills. X2 did not disappoint and it even offered a little teaser at the end with Jean.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Shadow007","10 May 2003","X-Men was a good movie, but not a great one. It had a number of deficiencies. The most crucial of these IMO was the story itself. It never really engaged the viewer all that much. X2 OTOH has a much better story line. It is perhaps a little too obvious for the viewer but it is nonetheless more interesting.X2 contains many action sequences laden with special effects. The movie hasn't been bogged down too much by all this and most of them are fairly original and well done.The movie also continues the attempts at characterisation, especially of Wolverine, and for the most part seems to try too hard. The ""chemistry"" between Wolverine and Dr Jean Gray seems too forced. It would also be nice to see Rogue given more of a job than simply being an ornament, but a rather nice one at that :) Perhaps if there is an X-Men 3 she'll get to do more.The comedic elements of the movie are once again well done with Jackman delivering some great dead-pan one-liners.Overall, X2 is a fun and enjoyable movie but it must be remembered that it really isn't trying to be anything other than an action movie. It's perhaps a little long also.7/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","preppy-3","11 May 2003","Picks up right where the first one left off. The plot is way too convoluted to get into--there's enough plot for three movies here, and that's the main problem. More than once the movie has to come to a screeching halt for exposition and it really bogs things down. Also there were too many characters--that was a problem with the first film. This time they compound it by adding MORE characters! Also Cyclops and Professor X were horribly underused. There were also a few nagging questions left unanswered--PLEASE SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Where does Collosus take the mutant children when the school is under attack? And why is Wolverine's past STILL a mystery at the end?Still, the movie did a lot of good things. They did get rid of two of the stupider villains (Sabretooth and Toad). They added Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who gets a lot of screen time and beefed up the roles of Iceman, Pyro and Rogue. Also, Collosus has a few scenes. As with the first movie, Wolverine is center stage again (this is a good thing) and Halle Berry seems much more comfortable as Storm the second time around. The younger cast members seem very comfortable with their roles (especially Paquin) and Ian McKellan is great again as Magneto. Also Mystique has much more screen time and the sequences with her were just great.Also the acting is good, the special effects terrific and it was very touching at the end.So, aside from a few dead spots, this is a very good super hero movie.","

Not long afterward however, Stryker uses his new-found authority to torture ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellan), who is still imprisoned in his plastic prison cell, in order to gather enough information to launch an attack upon the school founded by ""Professor Charles Xavier"" (Patrick Stewart). Now, rather than disclose Stryker's ultimate agenda and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a decent sequel to the original ""X-Men"" movie. I liked the acting of Alan Cumming and I certainly didn't mind the presence of Halle Berry (as ""Storm""), Famke Janssen (""Jean Grey"") or Kelly Hu (""Lady Deathstrike""). However, I didn't care for the ending or the fact that there were probably too many characters and not enough film to cover them all. On the whole then I rate this movie as slightly above average.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ligross","2 May 2003","The first scene with Nightcrawler attacking the White House while Mozart's Requiem: Dies Irae plays is one of the greatest combinations of film and music I've ever seen!  I've loved this piece for years for its intensity, the way it combines fear, wonder, terror, amazement, despair, etc. . . Everything I've always felt about it was summed up in Singer's opening montage:  the action, the violence, the awe - it's all there.  I've never seen classical music used to greater effect.  I nearly pulled my friend's arm off when I knew what I was listening to while some mysterious creature was ravaging the President's guards I was so excited.  She thought I was a complete dork.  But really, in this scene Nightcrawler IS an angry god, punishing the insensitivity and intolerance of humanity, raining blue lighting from above.

Over Sentimentalism. Tv soap opera level romanctic scenes. Criminal lack of action. Criminal lack of excitment in the missions and a criminally bad score.But still, with an even better Hugh Jackman, an entertainig and overall good villain and villainous plot, and an improvement in the quality of the action plus a way better ending and overall more coherent and more entertaining third act, it ends up being average or mediocre.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","neil-476","23 March 2011","Bryan Singer follows up the somewhat exploratory X-Men with a sequel which goes forwards with further developments in the 3-way conflict between humans, mutants, and militant mutants. He also goes backwards in tracing part of Wolverine's back story. Plus he introduces more characters to the ensemble and raises the stakes (both narrative and cinematically) by an appreciable percentage.Once more he orchestrates his ensemble masterfully. Everything which made the original film successful is here again, only there is more of it - but Singer never goes into overkill.The main unexpected joy of this film - to this ageing fanboy, at any rate - was how exactly right they got Nightcrawler. Alan Cumming was perfect casting, the makeup works perfectly, the opening sequence shows perfectly how Nightcrawler's action in the comics translates into ""real life"", and they found the perfect sound for ""Bamf!""

Singer knows exactly what he's doing and I can't imagine anyone else at the helm for the third one.  He at least has to write it, that's for sure.  Even if you've never seen the first one, X2 cleverly gives you all the info you need without beating you over the head AND makes you want to see the first one again.This even beats The Crow as my favourite comic film.

In fact, it is actually very moving... And I don't want to ruin your pleasure talking about the ending...The new characters (especially The NightCrawler) are great and looks wonderful on the screen. The directing of Director Bryan Singer is the same as the first one and the actions sequences are even better because it has much energy and punch... Don't miss the combat between Logan and DeathStrike!The movie has also a very interesting message under all the blockbuster and entertainment with reminiscences about politics, socials and war. It can contents all the stuff to fulfill any kind of audience.For my pleasure, the great composer John Ottman takes the place of Michael Kamen for this sequel and writes a FAN-TA-STIC score... With a large orchestra, chorals and his magnificent direction the music of X2 is both martial and emotionnal... And i don't tell anything about the use of classical music in certain sequences.

The whole digit following a letter thing looked lame when it proceeded The Mighty Ducks sequels, and it does X-Men no justice either. A military officer involved in Wolverine's past is committed to rid mutants from the planet. Magneto is imprisoned in a plastic cell, and the wheelchair bound leader played by Patrick Stewart is kidnapped. Other characters include Nightcrawler who has the ability to deteriorate. Mystique has the ability to conform the likeness of others. Exhilarating action throughout with a more satisfactory conclusion. Directed by Bryan Singer who successfully creates a film that surpasses the first film. He is backed with fine casting including Hugh Jackman as Woverine who is involved in much action yet still an appealing character. Patrick Stewart learns that the military officer's son is a mutant. Ian McKellen as Magneto is locked away but still proves dangerous when underestimated. Alan Cumming plays the ominous Nightcrawler who came from evil but descends into good. Rebecca Ronijn plays shape shifter Mystique who can take the appearance of anyone. The visual effects and makeup are colourful, united with a much better screenplay. Score: 8 / 10","

Otherwise I do find the film not as good as the first, mainly because the plot, while good, is not so tight as in the first, and the acting is bad. In the first film the good actors (Xavier, Magneto, and Wolverine) were given larger parts which helped disguise the poor acting from other members of the cast.

X-2 was extremely boring; the last half hour stretched on forever.  on top of all this, the film came off as preachy.  i got the whole 'mutants are oppressed' thing in the first movie.  no need to beat me over the head with it.
juvenile, bland, contrived and unimaginative, i didn't enjoy x-2 at all. i went to see it on opening day...i'm not predisposed to disliking such a film; in fact, this is the kind of film to which i most look forward.  i love blockbusters and special effects.  i love action and superheroes. this one just didn't do it.  it didn't work.  this one was aimed at 14 year old boys, not at me.  i remember myself at 14 and i can assure you i wouldn't have enjoyed x-2 at that age, either.  it's crap.  it's garbage.  it is a coloring book filled with the wrong colors by a retarded infant.","

Freed from the constraints of telling an origin story (and infused with a bigger budget), ""X-Men United"" gets down to the business of throwing more characters at us, widening the scope and delivering great comic book movie spectacle - all while deepening the gay rights symbolism (you can widen this to civil rights in general if you so choose, but it's pretty on-the-nose here). Ian McKellen owns, once again, but Brian Cox is a great addition, as well as Alan Cumming (he made a great Nightcrawler).Even if this movie was lacking, you still have to admit that that opening - Nightcrawler's balletic attack on the White House - was pretty damn cool. Fortunately, this movie surges right along and lets the property live and breathe. In retrospect, the one downside is that Singer wasn't around for the third movie.

It's incredibly entertaining because it features visceral action and compelling character depth in equal measure. It's consistently enjoyable, but maintains a layered narrative approach that set its predecessor apart from others in the genre (which was still young at this point). This time, Singer really lets loose with the action sequences and provides some memorable, well-choreographed and genuinely tense scenes far improved from the first.

It is crammed with character arcs, underlying messages, and tells the main plot thread of mutants uniting in the face of a common enemy.There are a number of scenes that express a lot about the film's themes about diversity and marginalised society. Where the original focussed on the divisive rhetoric of leaders, this one looks at actual attempts at subjugation, the mutant response, and the preludes to a possible conflict. There are scenes such as the mutant 'coming out', and Professor Xavier's final speech that embodies the themes particularly well.The are some compelling arcs for the likes of Jean, Logan, Bobby, and William Stryker. Characters finding out about their past, dealing with rejection, and realising their potential are examples of formula that usually never fails to entertain.As a comic book movie it contains plenty of superhero spectacle and powers used for practical reasons as opposed to just look cool. This film presents everything on a larger and more impressive scale than its predecessor. Characters like Kurt Wagner, Eric Lehnsherr, Mystique, and Jean have numerous impressive moments.Generally the visuals are excellent and hold up very well 18 years later in the saturated market of superhero movies.For me the standout performers are Hugh Jackman, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, and Ian McKellen. Patrick Stewart is predictably excellent in the few scenes he is in.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","thesar-2","13 May 2010","As great the original X-Men was, X2 topped it, much like Spider-Man 2 over Spider-Man. They certainly up'd the ante on action, story and character development. And none of that was easy with the increased character/mutant list. Director Singer should be incredibly proud on pulling off what 98% of Comic Book sequels fail at: adding more and yet keeping the perfect balance all the while improving on the original. (Perfect examples are the recent Iron Man 2 and the original sequels to the original Batman.) There are multiple story lines here, but the majority wrap around the increasing war between Humans (and Politicians) and the Mutants. Profession Xavier (Stewart) is juggling a lot on his wheelchair-bound lap: Wolverine's (Jackman) background, Grey's (Janssen) future, Magneto's (McKellen) present, all while running a school, bartering for equality and helping even the guilty/used mutants.Most times, I have problems with multistory lines in movies, especially comic book and definitely comic book sequels (SEE: Iron Man 2 and Spider-Man 3) but here, everything was used to both further the story along and to enhance it by once again using everyone's different personalities and powers efficiently. Every scene was extremely well crafted, there was enough plot and character development for you to root for both the good and the bad.The battles were well crafted, the characters flushed out perfectly and the action intense, even when nothing was happening. In a lot of movies, the actors simply rely on the director to command everything with full trust. Here, it paid off, in dividends, and they seemed to be having a good time while portraying a good story. As a sequel, it was a great pay-off. On its own, it's a great movie. No one should miss this great adventure.I haven't given too much away â one of my Kryptonite weaknesses, so just sit back, enjoy. If the actual premise or the fact you liked part one is your fancy, you will love this feature.","

Logan, Jean & Storm are some of the standouts in this movie & I particularly love the Phoenix scenes throughout the film ( too bad they don't carry this over to the next movie. The storyline is great and I love how it manages to balance numerous villains, all in all a great movie and always fun to rewatch!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","StevePulaski","7 May 2014","X2: X-Men United plays, feels, and consistently moves with the grace and charm of a comic book, and that's about the highest compliment one could pay to a film of the superhero genre. Riddled with sublime special effects, some characters we can further invest in, and drama and subtext that is further elaborated to provide for a viewing that requires us to keep our brains on, if you catch my drift.The story reacquaints us to Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his team of loyal X-Men, who fight for the idea that humans and mutants, those with extraordinary, life-altering powers, can live harmoniously together. However, there has been a great deal of anti-mutant ideology being peddled by Congress and the general public, specifically lead by Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox). Stryker pushes for a mutant genocide, believing that humans shouldn't have to share their planet with mutants in any way.Of course this calls for some form of combat, which is where our uncanny X-Men come in. The clawed-Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the easily-underestimated Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and the shy but imitable Rogue (Anna Paquin) attempt to lay to rest these ideas, and also, once again, stop Magneto (Iran McKellen) from yet another bout of attempting to have mutants control the universe Much of X2's success is attributable to the talent of director Bryan Singer, who pulls most of the same punches he used to get the first film off the ground. The only difference is with X2 is that he does things a little bit bigger in size and scope, with larger action setpieces, new characters to meet, and the characters we already met being further expanded for stronger character depth.The special effects, for me, are what stood out more in this second installment. Singer never missed a beat when it came to filming large, grandscale action in the original X-Men and never does he misstep here. Singer's action, combined with the strong editing work of John Ottman and Elliot Graham, possesses a rare fluency to it, where action exists as something to look forward to and utilize in addition to character development, plot, and thematic resonance. Too often is it utilized and exploited in place of those things rather than working harmoniously with the additional devices - like humans and mutants should.It also helps that the look of the film is crisp and clean thanks to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. Sigel captures everything Singer wants to include in X2 with a beautiful look and style, effectively mirroring the camaraderie on screen with the aesthetic, appeal, and kinetic movement of a comic book. The film doesn't go for the similar, more blatant style of comic book mimicking as seen in Ang Lee's Hulk, which would release theatrically about a month later than X2, which attempted to create the feel by using the picture-in-picture method. Yet, both films find ways to succeed using their own style, with Singer and Sigel's route to a comic book providing for consistent fun and enjoyment.On a film note, one cannot neglect the performances at hand here. Jackman, once again, works well at playing a character we find it difficult to have sympathy for at times, while at others, being effortlessly fun and likable. Paquin still nails the subtle facial and body communications of Rogue, while Berry and Janssen continue to fit well in their assigned roles. Throw in Ian McKellen for good measure and you have a complete package for X2 After watching the first two installments of the X-Men franchise, the sole word I can conjure up is ""impressive."" Who would've thought that two films concerning mutants, bearing a heavy emphasis on special effects but not neglecting the human element of the story nor the thematic ideas of discrimination, would live up even after a decade? The fact that the first two X-Men films possess more elements than incredible, bombastic special effects ensures a longer lifespan than your average blockbuster, many of which have a hard time bringing much else besides their looks to the table.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Alan Cumming, Brian Cox, and Bruce Davison. Directed by: Bryan Singer.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","=G=","26 November 2003","""X2"" tells another tale about our favorite mutants and a few new ones too but it's not likely anyone is really going to care about the story. What the film has to offer is solid effects, heavy on the CGI, with babes, kids who kick butt, lots of cool special powers, and action and stunts up the wazoo. In other words, it's a good flick for younger audiences, comic book freaks, and the like. Personally, I grew utterly bored with it and gave up about 10 minutes before the end. Nonetheless, it's a respectable effort and probably better than ""X1"" (X-Men) in most respects. (B-)","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","hpippen3","5 May 2003","Okay. . .the first X-Men was a little slow. But it was necessary. For those unitiated in the X-Men universe, there was the necessary character development and slow-moving storyline. X2 picks up where X-Men left off -- there's little, if any, deep character development but it gives X-Fans what they want -- action, action and more action. It reminded me of the first Star Trek movie. If you remember, it was kind of slow -- bringing everyone back up to speed on Star Trek and where are they now. Now, that was settled -- they unleashed ""Wrath of Kahn"" which absolutely kicked butt and took names. X2 is the same deal -- building on the foundation established by the first X-Men, X2 cranks up the volume. It is definitely a must see!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","paul2001sw-1","12 November 2006","The basic idea of the 'X-Men' series of films is a good one: humans seek to exterminate a race of highly evolved mutants, who themselves plot to take over the world. Meanwhile, a second group of mutants attempt to broker a compromise. Although there are obvious villains, the fact that compromise might not be possible, and the understandable motivation of the warring parties, add some interest to the scenario: Ian Mackellan's evil Magneto, for example, is a far more complex character than his Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'. The films are still based on a comic book, which means, in a film, lots of special effects and extended action sequences that can grow tedious; but if anything, this sequel is superior to the original, because there's less need for exposition and the role of Magneto is more ambiguous: as a self-contained story, it works better than the second parts of 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Matrix', or 'Star Wars', to give three examples from other trilogies Ultimatelty, it's all hokum; but mostly entertaining, and far from brain dead.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","30 May 2003","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI actually watched this on Wednesday,but,on leaving the cinema,I was a little unsure on what I thought of it,to be honest.Over the past two days,I've had some time to give it some consideration.And I've managed to get over a few of the misgivings I might have had about it.Coming from Bryan Singer,who helmed the original,it stood a chance in my mind anyway of matching that film's dark,gothic feel and sense of creativity.Then again,the sequel to Men in Black was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld,who directed that film's original,and that was easily the worst film of last year.Then again,this film was made a lot sooner than the other one,and is ,at the very least,more relevant.One of the driving forces behind it's existence was obviously to make lots of money by capitalizing on the success of the original,but then aren't these films always?But,compared to a lot of the other no brainer drudge fests that have occupied our screens of late,X2 certainly respects your intelligence at least.Speaking of the direction,Singer guides a stern,thoughtful script along evenly,and wisely adds touches of flair and humour in at appropriate interludes,meaning the affair never becomes too heavy handed.On the performances front,as the two older members of the central cast,Ian McKellen and good ol' Patrick Stewart craft some marvellous,engaging chemistry between themselves as the intermittent good friends/deadliest adversaries and can pretty much play each other off like chess players.Sure,a fair bit of the dialogue they are given to work with is pretty tired and cliched,but it's that undeniably infectuous sense of commaradere that engages the audience's emotions so well.It's also a good examination of how,indeed,the best of friends can be the most powerful of enemies.Brian Cox is convincingly twisted as the main villain here,whilst Hugh Jackman remains fun in the leading role and male testosterone levels can reach mammoth heights at the sight of Halle Berry in a long leather coat.And Alan Cumming makes an above average but below fantastic debut as 'the Nightcrawler'.Some may argue it's overlong.Others may argue it's providing a greater level of character development and enforcing it's social message more.Some may argue it's just an inevitable but fun and slick Summer blockbuster,that isn't in T2 leagues of greatness,but certainly not a bad night out at the pics and easily one of the best sequels in a long time.***","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","mistoppi","5 May 2016","I remember the times when I was so into X-men and I basically followed everyone else's opinion on the movies. People said (because of the comic books) X2 is one of the best movies because it built the Phoenix Saga and all that, and X-Men: The Last Stand was horrible and so on. But I have to admit, I'd rather watch The Last Stand. Mostly because that movie simply looks better, and also because I want to watch a movie and not just judge it based on the comics I haven't even read.The dialogue in X2 is annoyingly clumsy, and the writing isn't too special in other ways neither. I get that superhero movies aren't usually very original, but the plot structure of X2 is so basic it's annoying. The most intriguing thing about this film is the metaphor of mutants and the moral dilemmas, but compared to the first X-men movie or The Last Stand there's really no way to choose a side in this film. Superhero movies are usually extremely black-and-white: you know who the good guys are, you know who the bad guys are. Magneto sometimes brings the moral grey areas into the mix, but because he isn't the main antagonist of X2, the movie doesn't offer that anymore. Everyone watching X2 knows Stryker is horrible, it's not even up to debate. X2 is an alright superhero action movie, but doesn't offer anything interesting to the viewer, but were you expecting anything other than the usual stuff superhero movies throw our ways?","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","KillerLord","9 June 2009","I was not at all happy with the slowness and dullness of the first installment of the X-Men. And I had compared it with Superman Returns and concluded that perhaps slow was how Singer did his work. At least, to me. I had argued that one does not need to make a story too strong if he can give some breathtaking sequences that leave us spell-bound which too were quite absent in the first installment. It is almost as if Brian Singer was aware of these and decided to correct them in the second installment.As far as the story is concerned, there is still no significant change. The story has not much of a higher dimension but I never felt the absence of this since the action was just too well done in the movie. There are some really amazing and breathtaking sequences throughout the movie. The action unfolds very smoothly and the places and action are so believable in the sense that there is no cartoon-like touch to it. A very strong job done by the CGI people.The movie is filled with newer kinds of X-Men with better and unique abilities setting the stage for some fantastic battles. And the best part is that we have some shades in the characters now that make us identify with them. The character of Wolverine is better developed and makes us wonder about him. Xavier wins our respect with his silent and spiritual way of looking at the world. Surprise! The presence of mutual respect between Magneto and Xavier also wins us over! It is just too well exhibited. Overall, there are shades of emotions in the character that make them involving.Overall, this movie is a much better package than its predecessor which was quite devoid of proper emotions, character stress and development and for that matter - stunning action. This movie takes the standards way ahead and is just a good package.","

The first movie was good but this sequel is so much better. This has a well crafted story and has way more action sequences that the first movie lacked. In fact not only is there more action in this there is more creative use of powers and the fight sequences are so much more entertaining to watch. This is a superheroes movie done right in almost every way, it's not a perfect movie but it's hands down a great one. That fans of these types of genre should most definitely not miss out on. This time around the X-Men and the brotherhood of mutants team up to battle. Everything is done very well to the point that it seemed like the first movie was sort of like a build up for this movie.8.2/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","CinemaClown","9 May 2014","Bigger, stronger & arguably better than its predecessor, X2 is a terrific follow-up to the first X- Men film which moves the story of X-Men universe forward while also expanding it in a controlled manner. The story here puts the X-Men & Brotherhood against a military scientist who's planning to annihilate the entire mutant species by manipulating Professor Charles Xavier & his mutant-tracking computer, Cerebro.Opening with an explosive sequence set in the White House & accompanied by Mozart's Requiem music in the background, director Bryan Singer expertly sets the pace of this second instalment which never really slows down by much till the very end. The writing is also good with enough time devoted for the introduction of new characters as well as for its own story to uncover. VFX look dated today but that's expected yet the basic elements of the film work spectacularly well.Coming to the performances, the recurring cast make a solid contribution to the film while the new characters are interesting, gradually developed & definitely not wasted away. The most impressive amongst all turned out to be Mystique once again plus it also reveals a little backstory of Wolverine character. Cinematography is sharp, editing is tight & music does a better job here than it did in the previous film.On an overall scale, X2 (also promoted as X2: X-Men United or simply X-Men 2) is a rare sequel that meets the expectations raised by the success of the original. And even though its story may not have the same quality as its predecessor, the action & other elements still end up making a pretty satisfying, enjoyable & very entertaining cinematic experience. Recommendation? If you liked the first film, you'll most probably end up loving this sequel.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","bowmanblue","3 February 2015","I was never that much of a fan of the original X-men movie, not that I'm a die-hard comic book fan of the source material; I just thought it could have been better. Luckily, X-men 2 (or 'X2' as it's sometimes known) is that rarest of breeds â a sequel that actually surpasses its predecessor.For the few of you that don't know, the X-men are a bunch of superheroes (or 'mutants' as is the term here), naturally each having his or her own superpower. And, whereas the nice of our mutated friends hang out at 'Professor X's' 'school for the gifted,' those less keen on helping mankind are part of Magneto's 'Brotherhood.' Naturally, the two groups have a tendency to square off from time to time and anyone like me, i.e. not a superpower to my name, does tend to get caught in the middle.Therefore the President of America isn't too keen on his voters being fried to a crisp with some sort of mutant 'mind-ray' and enlists the help of one slightly psychotic general (Stryker) to come up with a plan to get rid of all mutants â good or bad. This, in turn, means that the X-men have to team up with the Brotherhood in order to save their collective skins. So, you have a nicely uneasy alliance formed (which you basically know won't last, but it's still fun to watch).And it's generally a great adventure to watch. If you're generally into superhero movies then you've probably seen the 'Marvel' films. It's worth noting that X-men does have a flavour of its own and, despite being taken from the same comic universe, feels different enough to make it stand out in its own right. Its tone is overall darker than the films of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but, unlike Marvel's heroes, the X-men has to concentrate on more characters at once.It's an 'ensemble' cast, with many famous faces playing the leads. Therefore not all the X-men really get as much screen time as the probably deserve. Yes, there are a few 'lesser' mutants who don't really matter, but equally most of the cast would probably be able to carry an entire film of their own (not just Wolverine, the fans' favourite who spawned an entire franchise of his own). Yes, (the many) fans of Wolverine will be happiest, as he's clearly the star, but Sir Ian McKellen gets a decent crack of the whip as the leader of the Brotherhood.One misfire was 'Nightcrawler.' I do actually remember him from the comics as a creepy-looking good guy who basically looked like a monster/vampire. I always pictured him a dark and hulking presence, brooding silently and basically playing the part of the anti-hero. However, he's sort of more the 'comic relief' of the film, always jabbering on like a blue-faced Jar Jar Binks. Luckily, like many of the lesser mutants, he's not in it that much, but he could have been so much cooler than he is (my opinion!).So, all in all, if you like your superhero movies and enjoy them with a darker flavour than your average Marvel epic, give this one a go. If you're well into your X-men comics, it might be worth checking the cast list to see how much your favourite character is in it â even a big film like X2 can't cater for every mutant!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","the_silent_man","2 May 2003","Liked the first movie ?YouÂ´ll love X2. In my opinion, itÂ´s the best ""comic-book adaptation"" ever made (with X coming in second place).Almost everything about this movie is superb: thank God the US$ 120 million were well spent. The plot is very good (based upon the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"" bu Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson) and the subplots develop swiftly, joining with the main plot at the exact time. The visual effects are this movieÂ´s ace feature. TheyÂ´re just spectacular! The Nightcrawler and Mystique shots prove that. The actings are also good (especially Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine)as well as the diection by Bryan Singer.Well.... whatever, you guys wonÂ´t care about what IÂ´m writing anyway.... But really, if you like good action/adventure flicks, go ahead and watch X2. You wonÂ´t be disappointed.  But if your favourite movie of the last year was Maid In Manhattan, donÂ´t even bother going to your local cinema.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Robert_duder","27 May 2006","X-men 2 is what most sequels end up being...most good sequels anyways. It relies heavily on opening up the story set by the original, plays heavily on the best characters from the original and adds in some new ones for good measure. Bryan Singer returns to the helm for the second installment and continues treating the series like his baby and meticulously lays everything out. Everyone from the original cast returns and they even come up with a well done, and interesting new storyline that forces the two mutant sides who were enemies in the original, to now work together. The action sequences in the film are quite intense or plentiful as they were in the original and some of the great characters get a bit of a toned down story in this one which is unfortunate.The entire main cast returns and they are still one of the best cast group in film history...especially Superhero films. Hugh Jackman is still basically the star and he's as good, if not even better than he was in the original. He doesn't do as much fighting but more of his story is explored. Everyone else in the film takes a rather toned down, back seat to Wolverine's story. In some ways this is a good thing and unfortunate in other ways. Whereas James Marsden's Cyclops seemed to be a terrific character with witty one liners and a great screen presence in the original, he's almost wrote right out of the second installment. He gets a couple of emotional scenes involving his love interest (the still very wooden Famke Janssen as Jean Grey) but his lack of tough leadership makes the emotional scenes seem out of place. The addition of some new characters are very welcomed and well done. Alan Cumming is brilliant and a great character as Nightcrawler. Seemingly a bad guy he turns out to be an amazing hero. Cumming's performance is great and I hope he returns in the future. The slightly increased role of Iceman played by Shawn Ashmore is decent and not overused thankfully. I think his young character could be easily an annoyance to the big action scenes. Brian Cox as the newest bad guy, William Stryker is good, although I don't know if he's good enough in the sense that he takes on some powerful adversaries including Magneto played brilliantly by Ian McKellen and Wolverine (Jackman.) X2 relies heavily on it's story and it's purpose is likely to bring together the original installment and the supposed final installment currently in theaters. As a story driven Superhero film it really works but after the non-stop intense battles and action scenes from the original you definitely feel the absence of the really big battles. Still that's not to deter you from an amazing series with a deeply rich character driven story. This is one series that is worth seeing absolutely, even if you're not familiar with the X-men of comics. You'll become familiar with them, Singer has done an incredible job thus far. 8/10","

This time however we are introduced to Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler a blue-skinned creature who can tele-port anywhere he wants to go. We first see him at the Presidents house as we later meet our new villain Skyler(Brian Cox) who gate-crashes into Professor Charles Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) mutant school and also happens to know Wolverine(Hugh Jackman)and he wants to defeat all the mutants and get to use his son as an experiment to enter Professor Charles head to get the mutants and defeat them. So can the X-Men team defeat Skyler and save Professor Charles while teaming up with former baddies Mystique(Rebecca Romijn)and Magneto(Ian McKellan)?Bottom line is X Men is a great Comic Book movie and this sequel is a lot better than the first installment as we get to see more of the charcthers, as the first outing focuses way too much on Wolverine and Rogue(who are still in this film BTW). The cast is fantastic,especially Hugh Jackman. This guy is multi-talented at what he does and every charcther he has played so far(in some of the films I have seen him in) he always acts different in every film. For example he can be the dashing prince charming like charcther in Kate & Leopold,a bad ass in X- Men,a magician in The Prestige the list goes on. James Marsden was great too but I feel like he never gets enough screen time as like I said before Hugh Jackman is the star of X-Men and I have no idea who is gonna replace him in the next 20 odd years or less.Like I said I loved X Men 2 and if you never seen it I highly recommend it. And this is coming from a 24 year old single straight woman who grew up with X-Men and Spiderman.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ThomasDrufke","20 February 2017","The first X-Men is a fine film but it follows a similar formula than plenty of other comic-book adventures. It felt original and fresh at the time, but it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings as X- Men 2/X2/X2: X-Men United does. In fact, X2 gets better every time I watch it. Exceptionally directed by Bryan Singer with just the right amount of action and timely emotion, X2 is one of the best X-Men films to date.I'll always contend that the X-Men films are best when Magneto and Professor X aren't necessarily on opposite ends. Magneto has never been a cut and dry villain. There's always a grey area to him, and I think X2 nails that as well as any other X-Men film. Just like in Days of Future Past, he doesn't have an agenda until he's brought back into chaos. This time, the chaos is brought on by none other than William Stryker. Stryker is in charge of the facility which keeps Magneto captive, and is also the one who holds the answers to Wolverine's past. That in itself boasts some fascinating prospects for the film.But what's more impressive is how well this film once again balances all of its story fighting the ""bad guy"" while also having the ultimate antagonist (humans) feature so prominently in the story. It's not to the extent that the original deals with it (registration act), but at its core you know this film is about humans vs mutants. The two butting heads has always and will always be the way to take the X-Men's story.We get introduced to a few new mutants, and an extended look at Pyro and Iceman, but it's Nightcrawler that makes the biggest impression. The opening sequence at The White House is known as one of the best comic-book scenes to date, and rightfully so. It's terrifying and thrilling, which doesn't really describe his presence throughout the rest of the film, but it's quite the opening. Iceman is used more as a love interest for Rogue than anything else, but Shawn Ashmore is charismatic enough to verify his presence. Pyro, however, feels like the prototypical kid who was inevitably going to turn on his friends. You never truly believe that he's going to stick it out on the good side.With much higher stakes than the first film as the human race is at risk, it's no wonder the runtime is significantly longer than 2000's X-Men. There is rarely a second wasted, but having the entire last hour of the film take place at Alkaline Lake was risky. With so many mutants running around, it's easy to find someone to take up screen time, but that's a long time to spend at one particular location. So I can see where it may feel a little long and dragged on by the time we leave the place.The important thing here is that Singer keeps us on track with the story he wants to tell. It has more action, characters, and surprisingly more heart than I expected. X2 is a triumph on almost every front and set the franchise up for limitless possibilities and adventures. Unfortunately, we all know what happens in X-Men 3.+Balanced+Magneto blurring the lines+Emotionally resonant+Higher stakes-Could have done without Pyro9.0/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","MLDinTN","11 May 2003","but I still think the best comic book film is Spiderman.  Mainly because Spiderman was funny and I thought had a better villain.X-men 2 is way better than the first. The best parts were the beginning with Nightcrawler teleporting everywhere and the part where Magneto escapes because it is just so unique.  The fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike was really cool also as they slash each other time and time again. And I really liked how Mystique had a bigger role this time. She does some amazing stuff.  And Hugh Jackman looks really hot in his wife beater as he took on the army guys at the school.  Plus the music is better this time around.My one complaint is I wish it had some funny one liners. Plus, that dead Senator is back, of course as Mystique. But, how could that be possible because wouldn't he have to make a lot of public appearances, so that would mean Mystique would have to be him all the time.  Just something that made me say mmm...Now, I want to know more about how Wolverine came to be. I hope they make a movie based on Wolverine's past.FINAL VERDICT:  A must see. The best movie of the year so far.  Very entertaining with a lot of cool fights.","

The addition of Brian Cox as a villain to the cast certainly made things interesting.Overall, this is a great movie that has a good story, great acting, and great special effects. I rate this film 10/10.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Floated2","3 December 2017","X2 is an all around bigger and more explosive version of its processor the original X-Men. First, X2 is longer and includes more characters (such as Nightcrawler- who steals his scenes and Pyro- used for some comic relief) which gives them more screen time and is able to create more chemistry and more dimensions for the other mutants. The cast is also more familiar and the bonds are great. The action and overall plot is more enjoyable and entertaining, including more emotion and suspense throughout. We see more details brought in and more explanations about Wolverine's DNA and origin about his claws and genetics. Also Rogue (Anna Paquin) is less of a focus which works better and her acting has improved.Left with an ending that was an another clear cut sequel ending, the studios and everyone involved had knew this film would become a hit safe keeping a sequel (which was 2006's The Last Stand). Another thing which is an improvement in X2 is the overall character of Wolverine, he's still there talking but now we see more action scenes from him (this time around using his claws more in action and actually killing enemies). Less campy scenes and one liner dialogues including for comedic relief as well. X2 is overall a well directed, acted and thoroughly entertaining film which delivers what is was supposed to do. As a rewatch on 01/28/23' opinions remain same. X2 is the best X-Men film of the original trilogy and an overall entertaining watch. It holds up greatly nearly 20 years later and there were key little details have not completely noticed on the rewatch.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","The-Sarkologist","27 January 2012","This movie sort of begins where the previous one ended. Magneto has been defeated and is currently in a plastic prison, while Wolverine has returned to Northern Canada to check out an abandoned military facility that Xavier has discovered. Where the first film was merely an introduction to the X-men (and sort of focused on Rouge, as she was the first character we meet), this film has more of a focus on Wolverine, however we learn a little about his past, and also meet Colonel William Stryker, however at the end of the film his memories have not returned.The movie opens with an attack upon the president by a mutant known as Nightcrawler (I reckon Nightcrawler is cool). His power is the power to teleport short distances, and while he can teleport through walls, he prefers not to as he could materialise inside the wall. He is can also climb walls and ceilings, as well as having a tail that acts as a third arm. While Nightcrawler attacked the president, it quickly becomes evident that he did so against his will.William Stryker is a long time nemesis of Wolverine (not that Wolverine realises it) and has gained control of Magneto's prison. He uses Magneto not only to test his mind control drug, but also obtains detailed information on Carebro, Xavier's super computer. A quite mention of Carebro is that it is a computer that can only be operated by a telepath, and in the films enables the user to make a telephathic link with anybody in the world. It can also locate anybody in the world, but was made to enable Xavier to locate mutants. However, in the comics it is actually substantially more powerful in that it enables Xavier (and Jean Grey) the ability to astrally project, that is to travel anywhere in the world without actually leaving the room.This film, to me, is much better than the first as there are more twists to the plot, and it is not simply a Magneto vs X-men, as was the case in the first and last films. In this film, Striker is the antagonist, and Magneto actually attempts to assist the X-men, though for his own special purposes. Xavier is kidnapped, and a powerful telepath is used to send him into a fantasy world so as to trick him into using Cerebro to pretty much kill all mutants. Adding a further twist is that the telepath (Jason 143) is Stryker's son whom he has attempted to lobotomise due to his power, though this eventually failed.This is probably my favourite of the X-men films (excluding the prequel Wolverine), and it is not the last time we will see Stryker. I cannot say much about continuity in this film, particularly since it appears that the events relating to Jason and Stryker's dealings with Professor Xavier occur between the prequel Wolverine and this film. We do get glimpses of Wolverine's past, particularly when he enters in room where it is believed his skeleton was coated with Adamantium. However it is unclear in this film whether he lost his memory in the process or not (I believe that he did not, though this becomes much clearer in the prequel).","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","andrewnmiller","5 December 2017","Having already seen the first X-men movie and loved it, I couldn't wait to watch the follow-up, X-Men 2 and it didn't let me down. From it's themes and action scenes to the acting and direction, X-men 2 is a superior sequel to the first one in almost every possible way.The movie begins with a indoctrinated mutant named Nightcrawler breaking into the White House and tries to kill the president but is unable to and flees. In the meantime, Wolverine journeys to an old army base in Canada to find evidence about his past but discovers nothing. Professor X locates Nightcrawler and sends Jean Gray and Strom to find him, while William Stryker gets permission from the president to examine the X Mansion for it's mutant ties. Stryker's forces than attack the mansion and abduct several students while Wolverine and a few other mutants are able to escape while Professor X and Cyclops are also captured. Now, the remaining X-men and Magneto must unite to save the professor and stop Stryker from executing his plans of destroying all of mutant kind.With sequels, remakes and reboots being the main summer blockbusters these days, it's becoming harder and harder to find an action movie that has the capability to grasp your mind and engage your concentration so rigidly and doesn't let go until the film ends, X-Men 2 is one such movie. Usually, there are only a handful of movies where the follow-up is able to take all the previous elements from the first movie, effectively toss out anything that doesn't work and goes on to not only smash people's doubts or any kind of excitement for the movie but also utterly revalues and enhances the genre's credibility like The Dark Knight or Terminator 2. Given how the X-men feel more political and emotional than most other superheroes, the main aspects of the story lie with the characters and their battles for acceptance, their thoughts on how the world sees them, their relationships with each other, and how they all play a part in the story at hand while at the films core lies something a lot of modern action movies lack: heart.But it's also thanks to director Brian Singer's obviously endless capabilities to accurately portray the authentic essence of the comics in a way that only a few directors have been able to do. Singly, wither they be hero, villain or as a team, Brian has managed to touch upon the emotional center of the comics and bring all these heroes and villains together in a movie that has no need for epic battles or witty dialog, but instead focuses on the lost arts of character development and interaction. Now, that's not saying that Singer follows the comics note for note as he does change things, but doesn't destroy it like what Josh Trank did to Fant4stic and while Brian's version of the X-men allows the viewer to appreciate that any changes made to the team are for the better like how skillfully Singer handles the character of Jean Gray and her hidden abilities as he reinterprets this variation by still bestowing her this power but using it to develop Jean as a character and allows the viewer to see the abilities she has and at the same time, Singer treats her along with the viewing audience and the fans with the utmost admiration while another fine case in Singer's abilities of character analysis is taking a villain like William Stryker who was a religious fanatic in the comics and turning him into a more dangerous bigot who still retrains some of his original holier-than-thou attitude but making Stryker a military man makes him even more ruthless and evil allowing Singer to give us a more complex and developed villain with a clear-cut plan and by adding in important sub-plots and characters that are used effectively make the movie what it is.The movie's screenplay is able to juggle it's vast amount of characters without feeling too rushed as it gives each hero and villain a decent amount of development as well as has a change to have their moment without the movie feeling too cumbersome while there are plenty of Easter eggs for fans of the comics that don't endanger the course of the story. The movie also has a lot more smooth action scenes than the first one including Nightcrawler's spectacular attack on the White House and Wolverine slicing and dicing Stryker's men during the attack on the X mansion while John Ottman gives us some incredible and catchy themes that complement the movie while the editing and cinematography are to a high level.Of course, the movie would be nothing without it's cast and it delivers that on a silver platter. Ian McKellan continues to show his acting credibility as Magneto and he doesn't hold back when it comes to the malice and warmongering, yet brings a level of class to the character as does Patrick Stewart as Professor X by conveying a relaxed grace as well as all the characteristics of a father figure and leader while Halle Berry brings the usual believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Anna Paquin is back as Rouge and gives a fantastic performance as does James Marsden as Cyclops, even if he's given little to do, Rebecca Romjin once again brings a dangerous edge to Mystique. Shawn Ashmore is believable as Iceman, showing great emotional range while being very likable. Aaron Stanford is great as Pyro, Famkie Jensen is again fantastic as Jean Grey and is given quite a lot of development which makes her all the more relatable. Allan Cummings is fantastic as Nightcrawler while Brian Cox plays a wonderfully menacing William Stryker. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine and has completely made the role his own from the action scenes to the emotional moments.Go watch this movie, it's truly awesome.","

With an amazing story & plot, X2 takes the superhero series into a whole new level.Wolverine, Cyclops & Storm are back with Prof. Xavier. The past is dug up & minds played with. Everything is deep, the screenplay induces pure entertainment, X-Men style.The CGI is brilliant but I felt it is sidelined by the plot. Most superhero films have clichÃ©d elements, where X2 stands out. The villain is so vindictive, he gets personal. The music is good, as well.BOTTOM LINE: Not much can I talk about this, but X2 is definitely better than its prequel. Highly Recommended!","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","sscsgh","25 November 2003","I saw this film in the summer and was really underwhelmed. I quite liked the first film, for style and tone if not the afterthought plot, so I was expecting good things from this film as the introductions had been done in the first film and we could crack on with a really good story.Maybe I need to see this film again but I don't see where on earth all these great reviews came from. I could see how people might think it was okay, or diverting and entertaining but no more. I left the cinema pretty cold. More characters were introduced, more background needed filling in and Bryan Singer seemed to not know how to handle it. Maybe it was the story/script at fault, maybe the editing went astray but I thought this was a lesson in how not to handle an ensemble film that an X-Men film is always going to be. He lost control of all the stories, especially near the end, it seemed like we were jumping between plotlines in a quite unplanned way.
As in the first film I didn't rate the main storyline much either. I hope that when X-Men 3 (or X3, or XXX or whatever it's going to be called) comes that the less is more approach is taken and we get a more structured narrative round the interesting characters, new characters are limited, and we get a good central storyline that is is more than a subplot for the ongoing humans versus mutants story. I think this franchise has potential from what we've seen but has been let down so far by weak story and weak characters.","

Considering Logan/Wolverine did not kill anyone in the first movie, he racks up quite the body count here.I remember liking this more than the first movie, when I first watched it. Watching them so close together, I do not think it is on par with the first movie.X-Men 2 grossed $214 million at the domestic box office, to be the 6th grossing movie of 2003.","

Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are as awesome as you'd expect, Rebecca Romijn and Famke Jannsen both deserve special mention too, as does Alan Cumming. But once again the star of the show is Hugh Jackman. He has a natural charm, that few movie stars have. He is a good looking man with a great physique and he has charisma in spades.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Dr_Coulardeau","21 October 2008","This second opus is bringing the war inside the human camp because one military scientist who had had the chance, though not to his taste, of having a mutant son and who had manipulated him so much that he had managed to take complete control of him, is provoking, or at least trying to, an open war of total destruction against the mutants. This time bad and good mutants unite to defeat that man though the bad mutants take over the game of the bad human and redirect the weapon from total destruction of mutants to total destruction of human beings. This drastic situation is saved in due time and just in time by the good mutants though the bad ones manage to escape and the good ones must sacrifice one of themselves to assure the escape. That will be essential later and it builds a promise because the death of a hero is always compensated by his or her resurrection, generally in that type of literature with an inverted personality. But the film is well built, the special effects are interesting, rich and at times funny. The dramatic tension is perfect and the President of the USA who was going to declare the state of emergency to take control of the mutants is informed by the good mutants about the actions of his mad scientist, and also head of some kind of national security, and we understand this President of the USA changes his ideas and convictions and moves towards a compromise with the mutants. But of course we know it can't last since the President was more or less forced to act that way and the bad mutants are still out there somewhere plotting evil.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","davidmvining","13 April 2021","Actually finding a way to anchor this sequel's story in a single main character's journey was a smart move. The first film was weighed down by a certain directionlessness that made it feel like a random series of events before pulling most of it together for a decent climax. The sequel, not needing to explain nearly as much to its audience or characters, is able to find surer footing from which to tell its story. It's definitely a step up in storytelling with the spectacle gaining an appreciable budget increase as well, which was nice of Fox to provide.Some time after the events of the first film, the mutant problem has gotten more tense. Magneto may be under lock and key in his custom plastic prison, but the effort to spark the war between human and mutant still lives. This starts with the first scene, an absolutely bravura sequence of the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attacking the White House set to the ""Deis Irae"" from Mozart's Requiem. The use of stunts, special effects, and editing makes this a great opening to the film, establishing the conflict and fear of the overall situation far better than Senator Kelly explaining that there's a girl who can walk through walls in the first film. This is the difference between exposition and using the tools of cinema to tell a story, and this is far more effective.Essentially, Colonel William Stryker is using the mutant situation to spark the war in a similar way as Magneto has always been expecting. Stryker is the ideal antagonist for this film. He's written as having direct ties to two main characters (Wolverine and Professor X), his plan is integrated in the base philosophy of the previous film's main antagonist, and he's played by Brian Cox. Cox, a Shakespearean trained English actor who has worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, brings the exact right kind of presence to Stryker. He's maniacal, intelligent, driven, and vicious all at once. His manipulation of his own son for his own ideological gains is precise and focused in a way that sells the idea that Xavier killed his son in his mind, justifying the actions he takes. He's a well-written antagonist to begin with, but hiring an actor of Cox's caliber just made it better.However, the movie does still suffer from a certain directionlessness to a lesser degree that holds it back. There's a standout scene near the middle of the movie. Stryker has attacked Xavier's mansion (another very good action scene, by the way), driven out Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro who decide to go to Iceman's parents' house outside of Boston. There, Iceman has to come out to his parents that he's not just going to a gifted kid's school, but he's a mutant. It's an entertaining little scene, gets turned into a police standoff by his younger brother's call to emergency services for reasons that are unclear (probably prejudice), they all get away, and then, well, Iceman largely disappears from the movie. Oh, he's there in the jet as the group flies to the third act, but he does virtually nothing for the rest of the film. The scene does have something to do with the central theme of finding a home, but because Iceman gets pushed so far for the rest of the movie and that scene was so specific to him, it ends up feeling like a weird extra scene rather than something integral. Nothing about the scene is particularly bad, but it just ends up feeling like it doesn't fit.Another thing that doesn't fit is the romance between Wolverine and Jean Grey. I've read that during filming of a key scene between the two the director, Bryan Singer, realized that it wasn't working so he had Wolverine just kiss Jean. I think the problem really is Wolverine himself. He's not wrong, but his sudden affection for a single woman feels out of character considering what's come before. The Wolverine who, until a few weeks before, was a loner wandering the wilds of Northwestern Canada refusing any kind of personal connection is suddenly completely smitten by Jean Grey for reasons. It just doesn't really work.Those are really the extent of my complaints, though. Centering the film so fully on Wolverine seems to retroactively justify his central presence in the first one to a degree. His past, enshrouded in mystery, gets answered to a certain amount through the plot mechanics involving Stryker. Stryker, who feels that mutation is a disease and is mad at Professor X for not saving his son from mutation, plans on using Professor X's mental abilities, enhanced by the large room Cerebro, to kill all the mutants on the planet. This is the kind of threat that brings together the old enemies of the past, uniting the X-Men with Magneto, but Magneto also has his own plan to turn the situation to his own advantage. This is all well laid out and executed stuff.What really makes it work, though, is Wolverine. He is our main window into this world, and his discovery is ours. Tying the whole plot to his emotional arc was smart. We are digging into his past, finding out that its filled with dark secrets and that he's a new man with the ability to move on. Stryker is a key to that past. The action takes place at the old location where Wolverine lost his past, but it also works as the kind of place that Stryker would take his off the books operation. It all fits together just so well.So, it's an imperfect film that delivers on its main promise while feeling oddly incomplete and unmerited in other, smaller ways. Perfectly well acted by everyone, in particular Brian Cox as Stryker, it's a fun adventure movie with a strong central throughline to hang most of the movie off of. A smaller cast of characters might have helped regain some focus in the middle section, though.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","johnnyboyz","7 October 2010","Was the title ""X-Men 2"" really so long that we needed it abbreviated to form ""X2""? As it happens, Bryan Singer's 2003 follow up to the reasonably pleasing a film from 2000 entitled X-Men is a little longer and a little baggier in its biting off more for us to chew on. Wheter it pulls off everything it decides to take on is one matter, whether it does it at all well another; the fact remaining right the way through to its closing credits that some of the more ordinary stuff on show is explored and granted much more time than some of the other content which may have been interesting. Sure, it has its shocks and its twists but it has its tendencies to conform and that's the most frustrating thing. Regardless, from its dramatic opening sequence of a mutant and his attempted 'hit' on the life of a fictitious American president, to the closing allegorical monologue from said man about mutants with clear allusions to the item of terrorism as we're told to 'acknowledge' this new phenomenon, X2 is an enjoyable if draggy experience which hits enough notes.The bigger picture and generally wider spectrum of both character and narrative Singer was quite clearly setting up in the first film is here granted the room to flex its muscles. X2 sees an expansion in stakes and general atmosphere, a spreading out of its wings so as to encompass an all out war between human-beings and mutants when tempers fray between the species, corrupt government officials manipulate the circumstances around them and hardened relations between those within the fractions become greater. The film hops about all over the place in attempting to cover and develop each of the little sub-stories it's got going on, and it does a decent job of it overall. The strand running central, to all of Wolverine's (Jackman) journey of discovery as he tries to uncover how he became what he is; the love he has for Jean Grey (Janssen) but the love she has for Cyclops (Marsden) as well as Rouge's (Paquin) romance with Iceman (Ashmore) which interestingly runs on an idea revolving around how great harm will come to both of them if they kiss or attempt to express their love for one-another at such an age, is the captivity of chief Mutant villain Magneto (McKellen).Regardless of what people think, the film channels The Silence of the Lambs and the imprisonment of Hannibal Lecter in Magneto's clothing; cell and demeanour. It's nice of the asylum staff to play him classical music seemingly on cue, and while it isn't The Goldberg Variations by Bach, it might as well be. The consistent presence of Brian Cox, whom actually portrayed Lecter in an earlier novel incarnation, adds further mirth to proceedings when there really ought not be any. Magneto's being held by a top American military official named William Stryker (Cox), whom wants nothing more than to stoke the fire between the two species. For Stryker, it's less-so business in his feuding with the mutants and more-so personal; his son, Jason, once a subject of Xavier's mutant school only to come home thoroughly less than well off and grossly affect the family situation as a result. We're told to conclude that Stryker is more evil than at first when it transpires he keeps a bunch of kidnapped infant mutants in a grim little cell within a secluded Arctic-like base much later on.Like X-Men; the mutant's apparent superiority over the human's is presented, not by way of the imperious lead of the first in Wolverine as he wins bare knuckle boxing match after bare knuckle boxing match in an unruly part of town, but by way of new German mutant Nightcrawler (Cumming) and the aforementioned attempt on the American President's life. We sense trouble is unavoidably afoot after digesting such a sequence following on from an opening voice-over from the anchor character of the films so far in Professor Xavier (Stewart) while skirmishes out in the public eye do nothing to help. The sole surviving aide to Magneto from the first film arrives in the many forms of Mystique (Romijn), the earlier film going some way to paint freakish and disfigured portraits of Magneto's other aides with Xavier's then-and-now subjects much more handsome and more beautiful in their appearance. Here, all mutants are briefly aligned and the film has fun in its retaining of the one bodily 'scarred' character from the first, whom just happens to be able to change form as temporary new identities and allies themselves are forged. Singer has additional fun in constructing suspenseful sequences in which Mystique must infiltrate government zones and we have to remind ourselves that we want her to get away with it.Alas, each and every one of the strands X2 takes on seems to overwhelm the next; the film hints at some bigger, brasher and more interesting things when one younger mutant is discussing the correlation between his mutant persona and human-being persona with the all powerful Magneto. The inference being that it's probably better to be 'Pyro' than 'John Allerdyce'. The film is a flabby actioner, its meshing of content for all ages ranging from the adolescent with the more adult to the fact veteran actors Patrick Stewart; Ian McKellen and Brian Cox all feature prominently making for an odd experience of action orientated frills and more mature issues. Its formulaic finale and gradually more and more conformist to spectacle attitude is one of its more chief faults, but there is edible entertainment to be had out of X2; a digestible comic book adaptation from a director we feel relaxed to be in the hands of.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","poe426","1 August 2014","THIS is why it's so important for producers to pick the right director. In the hands of a less competent filmmaker, this one could've been laughable. (Not that a filmmaker suited to ONE franchise will be suited to all- SUPERMAN RETURNS being a prime example, in this case.) ""Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute,"" Professor X tells us in the opening voice-over. We're soon introduced to the sleazebag William Stryker (Brian Cox), who manipulates the weak-willed Nightcrawler into a one-man assault on The White House. This sets in motion a ""reprisal"" raid, in which Stryker is able to capture a sampling of teenage mutants to experiment on (his son, it turns out, is a mutant and Stryker has been experimenting on him): he wants to turn the world's mutants into ""normals."" Magneto, meanwhile, plans to reverse the effects of Stryker's machine (Cerebro II, patterned after Professor X's Cerbro, which allows him to telepathically contact every mutant on the planet at the same time). My one gripe about X-MEN II is the almost incidental part played by Cyclops- my favorite mutant from the early days of the comics (patterned after The Comet, no doubt, an early comic book hero who could fire bursts of energy from his eyes; the only real difference between the two being that The Comet could fly).

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ChrisTreborn","16 March 2005","I watched this movie, first time it was excellent, for the second time it was good, for the third it was O.K and for the rest it went awful! It miss something from the original, sorry I don't know why.X2: X-Men United (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 2000 original movie,""X2"" is the highly anticipated installment from Bryan Singer who forges ahead with his work, this time creating more complexities on the franchise. Based on the popular Marvel comic book series this second exposure was from the minds of Zak Penn, David Hayter and Singer himself.After Magneto was closed in the plastic prison Professor Charles Xavier was quiet busy in teaching his gifted students. The problems against mutant still existing, gets even worse when the President was attacked by a vaporizing mutant (Nightcrawler). The President now take firm look at the mutant issue, this time from the assistance of former U.S. military leader turned anti-mutant radical William Stryker. After seeing the aerial photograph of an unidentified aircraft (X-Jet) from Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, President gives permission to Stryker for trace down the whole area minus any blood shed. For that he meets Magneto, under some nostrum he was forced to give information about Xavier's mansion resulting a secret military operation at the mutant school for catching mutant students. Some are taken prisoner and others become fugitives, along with members of the school's elite team, the X-Men.What will they do next, will that be the beginning of War against Mutants, What will Xavier do to save mutant race from human and in return? Scripted by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter tells the continuing story of favorite mutants in a large canvas. They tried to give their best in this 2nd chance by adding few favorite mutants to the plot like Nightcrawler, Deathstrike, Colossus and the very little unrecognized ""Beast"" aka Dr. Hank McCoy. But the major problem in the movie was its plot, it got no strength, no intention, no drift it's Only got a great STORYBOARD. Producers plan was : Filling Weak plot adding essential cast from the original chapter, also by mixing new ones with the cut down of some previous mutants, then summing them with the trendy special FX. Mission accomplished, X2 was born.I don't know what the hell was respected Helly Barry thinking while reading this script. She was wasted completely, she got nothing to do with this movie, I can't remember a single scene of Storm from it, may be she liked to wear her new wig! Same thing happened to Scott Summers aka James Marsden, he was blown out of the map in this story, but hey he has some memorable scene which he performed nicely.Also some of the previous characters were removed from this version making a great miss at Ray Park's Todd, not like the original comic book smart character but still my favorite Tyler Mane's Sabertooth. The great miss was the removal of the musical genius Michael Kamen, resulting a non-thematically score in X2 from the unskillful replacement John Ottman. The original X-men soul was created enormously by the hands of veteran Michael Kamen giving a defined signature depth to the X-Men universe, but Singer's buddy John Ottman did noting to go beyond that level. His score was pliable when it comes to romantic themes as well as in action scenes where he failed miserable on Jean Grey's romantic triangle and Logan's uncovered past.An only thing stand along in the movie was Logan's storyline, plus the character developments in Jean Grey. Famke Janssen did a clear work in portraying the confused lover, where Jackman add few pounds to his acting styles. In the first movie I was unhappy to see Jackman's Logan minus muscles, X2 break that law, he is now so similar to Marvel comics Sean Chen's Wolverine. But his casual outfits sucked, he seemed scrawny like a chicken kid in the opening Canadian outdoors and hair looked dead. Kelly Hu as Logan's new killing enemy Yuriko Oyama was the only one so Accurate to the comic book character, besides Patrick's Xavier. Also Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler Rocked, decreasing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's Mystique screen value.All in all it's a movie we can bear with if it is not seen twice or more. This lame chapter features the drastic debut of Nightcrawler and the farthest final of Jean Grey so, Just See it for once.X2: X-Men United = Weak Plot: meant to United.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","fernandoschiavi","30 September 2016","With the huge amount of praise and good reception at the box office of the film which introduced Marvel's mutant heroes in theaters, it is only natural that a sequel was provided by 20th Century Fox. Again, Bryan Singer was invited to take the director's chair. Scripted by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter, based on the story of Zak Penn, David Hayter and Bryan Singer, this second adventure of the X-Men is based on the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", which introduces the X- Men and their enemies, the Brotherhood of Mutants, against genocidal Colonel William Stryker. This leads an assault on Professor Xavier school to build their own mutant screening version, the brain, in order to destroy all of Earth's mutants.Without the need for an introductory film to the universe of characters, Bryan Singer was able to give more grandeur and gravity will all plot, can better develop the characters, but this time, knowing give a final finish much higher in the action scenes, which, moreover, they are present in a greater amount. The director also keeps the debate on the acceptance of differences open in the first film. Interestingly the sequence in which Bobby Drake, the Iceman, tells his parents that is a mutant is, for example, is a parallel to a teenager interesting that reveals a homosexual family. Racism, religious beliefs, prejudice, changes of puberty and intolerance are mirrored in the problems faced by younger pupils Xavier.Seeking to correct errors of the first film, Singer managed to make a film superior to the first in several respects. First, he knew very well deal with a huge amount of characters in the scene. As for the new characters, the biggest news is on account of Kurt Wagner, or as it is known in the comics, Nightcrawler, played by Allan Cumming. The character is revealed the most realistic aspect of the film, with its religious devotion being well studied and turning it into the most human facet of the film. Lady Deathstrike and William Stryker also sound other highlights. huge success in the previous film, the main mutant, Wolverine continues highlighting. The love triangle between Jean, Wolverine and Cyclops also deepens. Mystique and Magneto are still more mingled and yield good scenes of comedy and sarcasm. Some characters that had appeared, more gain some prominence. Pyro (Aaron Stanford - the mutant who controls the fire), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), though still as students, already in the first team and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart ) and Syrin (Shauna Kain) also appear using his powers.The script is deeper and turns, thus maintaining the inserts of humor and the darker mood of well-balanced narrative in its various sub- plots (Stryker and his mutant son, the past of Wolverine, the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey, the revelation of the Iceman to be a mutant to his family and how she deals with it; the escape of Magneto's prison, the Stryker plan to eliminate mutants etc). Proof that there is more story to tell with almost a half-hour in length than its predecessor and present a more ominous story than the last. Unlike the first film, where the focus was greater in the development of the characters, especially Wolverine and Rogue, besides the obvious concern in presenting the world of X-Men to the public, this sequel surpasses the previous film in all aspects. Singer may be more to the point without worrying so much in this presentation of the universe of human and how mutants are inserted in it.In action scenes, Singer stands for performing one of the best opening sequences in movies based on comic books. Night can invade the White House, fight and win easily at least a dozen highly trained security staff to get the President of the United States. Another scene worth mentioning is the invasion of Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. A well-orchestrated invasion carried out in the dead of night, in which it sought surprise mutants that there studied and lived. And of course, all the conclusion of the story where the heroes seek to prevent the use of the brain to annihilation initially the X-Men. Overall, Bryan Singer increased violence, but made the most compelling fights (which happens between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is sensational from start to finish).Singer can make a film that delivers what it promises discuss. It goes deep to the issue of intolerance ""mutant phenomenon"" and the impact it would have on government and society. In addition, it raised the level of the action scenes and showed us how intense it could be a superhero movie. To close the pack, we still had a great hook to the ""Saga of the Dark Phoenix"" for future productions in an unexpected and poignant end. Action, emotion, humor, grand effects and an elaborate plot are present to the public and fans of the X- Men universe.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","TheMovieDiorama","5 December 2018","Bigger, better, bolder and quite simply brilliant. Not only is this the best 'X-Men' instalment, and yes I'm controversially including 'Logan' as well, but one of the best superhero films of all time. Now that the foundations have been built from its predecessor, Singer is able to build upon the relationships within the mutant world to create an infrastructure that boasts impeccably executed action and dark twists. A genocidal colonel leads an assault on Xavier's school so that he can build his own version of Cerebro, capable of destroying every mutant on the planet. What really makes this film claw its way above the rest, is its various storylines. The primary plot being the prevention of Stryker's Cerebro, one that allows Cox to be an enigmatic and memorable villain. Enabling the X-Men to unite and develop their relationships even further without being detrimental to the main story. This includes Jean Grey's uncontrollable powers, Rogue and Iceman's romance, Pyro's hatred for humans (although slightly underdeveloped) and Nightcrawler's Catholicism. Lesser subplots that give life to these characters, preventing them from being wooden superheroes. Singer's balance between each subplot was near perfect, with the focus still being on Wolverine and his attempts at finding solace. This ensemble cast contains an array of captivating performances, particularly Jackman, Stewart, McKellen and Cox, that allow their characters to be investing. The action sequences limit the amount of visual effects and create some well choreographed scenes, especially when Wolverine battles Lady Deathstrike. I do take issue with the underwhelming ending, forcing a sacrifice upon a character just to quantify a sequel (to which they easily could've survived). This then results in the concluding ten minutes losing that sharp pacing. Oh, and Paquin still can't act. Still, this sequel achieves that rare feat by bettering its predecessor by a substantial margin. Just a shame that the franchise peaks on the second film...","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","SSJAniFan","28 July 2003","X-2 is the biggest disappointment this summer.  No, Reloaded and Hulk didn't disapoint me:  I was right about both films sucking.  But X-2!  This was supposed to be the film that took the original hit to an extreme level!  It would revolutionize the comic book film genre again, just as the prequel did three years ago.  Sadly, this is not the case.  We have a horrible b-movie in place of what should have been a classic.What really makes the movie fall apart is the characters.  Remember how they seemed to feel realistic, and how we felt like we could relate to them? Well, the writers decided to toss that feeling out the window for part 2. These characters are extremely superficial, playing to their old, 2-d, flat comic selves, making it impossible for us to feel that they're real-life representations of the characters we knew so well.  Granted, some characters have moments in the spotlight more than before:  Ie., Iceman and Mystique(who actually has more than one line this time!), but many of the characters, with the possible exception of Wolvie, have had their roles largely diminished, most notably Cyclops.BOTTOM LINE:  The best comic book movie currently out on DVD is X-Men 1. This is a much better choice than wasting your time on this black sheep.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Movie_Muse_Reviews","11 February 2009","Before ""X2: X-Men United,"" there was always this dreaded fear of sequels. Finally we see how follow-up films can really outdo the original.There was nothing that wrong with ""X-Men,"" in fact it was a great imagining of the comic by Bryan Singer and it brought our attention to the importance of character development in a film with so many to follow. ""X2,"" however is more explosive, has slightly more characters and the plot blows the first film out of the water. The reason is story.The first film was a pathetic plot to turn world leaders into mutants by X-Men nemesis Magneto, (Ian McKellen) who believes in mutant supremacy. This installment is a brilliantly conceived plot that successfully interweaves various story lines like Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) mysterious past and Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) suddenly irritable powers into the main plot. While some of the subplots--not unlike the first movie--are under-developed, the ones that matter the most work fluidly.In ""X2,"" the president of the United States is attacked by a teleporting mutant, later to be revealed as famed comic character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). From the first scene you can tell the special effects budget is going to yield a film more visually awesome than the first. Nightcrawler evaporates into puffs of purple smoke and reappears to stylishly kick butt. First film shape-shifter baddie Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) also gets more CGI attention as does flame-thrower Pyro (Aaron Stanford). The attack puts the country on high alert and the president authorizes a man by the name of William Stryker (Brian Cox) to raid the X-Men Academy. Of course Stryker is a little more intimately tied to the mutant controversy than anyone realizes, soon forcing both evil mutants and good mutants to team up to defeat him. It would be shameful to spoil any more of Stryker's plan, but it's brilliantly drawn up by the writing team that includes director Bryan Singer.Singer brings the same style to this film as he did the first and the bigger budget just gives him more room to deliver great action in addition to character-driven story. He's really a great director for the franchise--not too over-the-top but capable of filming in that action movie style.Another great choice by Singer and story writers Zak Penn and David Hayter was not to go overboard with new mutants. Nightcrawler is the only substantial addition to the X-Men and Pyro and Iceman (Sean Ashmore), who made appearances in the first film, get further development. On the villain side, Magneto has no cronies other than Mystique, to account for Stryker and his deadly assistant Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama). This basically allows the script to dig further into the existing characters, even if some of them (Halle Berry's Storm and James Marsden's Cyclops) still get glazed over.""X2"" is just more exciting and clever than its predecessor. Knowing that ""X-Men"" was a hit but not a critical success, it seems the producers decided to be careful even with the film getting fasttracked by the studio. It definitely paid off.","

It was solid and serious and went much deeper into character development and the social issues which made the books stand out than I would have expected.  It stood out because it was NOT just a comic book movie.X2 is not a comic book movie either.  Unfortunately in its case, rather than rising above the genre, it falls beneath it.  Its really just another standard Hollywood action flick.  Undeveloped characters, quick but thoughtless action, standard plot, and a host of convenient coincidences and stupid decisions by the characters weigh it down.No better than a time waster.  Maybe even worse.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Anonymous_Maxine","7 May 2003","The original X-Men was a cool action movie with great special effects, excellent characters, awesome fight scenes, and, my personal favorite, some highly effective comic relief. Consider, for example, some of the stuff in the first film, such as the scene where Wolverine proves to Cyclops that he's really himself and not Mystique disguising herself as him, or when he tells Cyclops that someone else is in the room with them and to `keep his eye open.' Classic stuff, and as was the case in the original movie, the comic relief in the follow-up is great, and most of it comes from Wolverine.It's interesting to consider the fact that the movie tends to try to satisfy both its evolutionist audience as well as its creationist audience (the latter of which obviously makes up a considerably smaller portion of the audience). Nightcrawler is a great character, although after the opening fight scene (arguably the best scene in the entire film) he changes into a completely different character almost immediately. I was looking forward to seeing him as a wonderfully effective villain (at this point I'd like to remind you that I am not familiar with the X-Men comics and so don't know a lot about the characters beyond what's in the movies). I even loved the sound effects that were made when he would disappear and reappear somewhere else. It was strange that he kicked so much ass in the opening scene and then turned out to be completely timid.Besides being an interesting character, Nightcrawler is the one in which the majority of the faith-based content of the movie is concentrated. It is well known that evolution is based entirely on observable facts and is totally open to change when new revelations and discoveries are made, while creationism is based entirely on faith (and, it might as well be noted, on ignoring observable facts). It's interesting to watch as the movie tends to switch back and forth between the two, seeming at first to be almost a fight for screen time by screenwriters of different ideologies but turning out to be a revelation that faith and evolution are not opposites, but can work together. Evolution is a fact, we KNOW that it is true, and X-Men takes the formula and uses it to make a great action movie. The dangerous line that it walks is that is provides creationists, people who are notorious for taking evolutionary theory and mutilating and distorting it completely beyond recognition in a desperate attempt to make it look ridiculous. It is not going to be any surprise to see hordes of creationists who will latch on to something like X-Men and accuse evolutionists of thinking that X-Men is some sort of documentary-style, non-fiction account of the generally accepted current state of human `evolution.' I would like to take this opportunity to laugh in advance. It should be obvious that this is a movie made for entertainment purposes, even if only by the fact that not all of the `mutants' are, in fact, mutants. Wolverine, for example, was created by a human (not a God, by the way), as was his worthy adversary near the end of the film. But as far as taking enormous liberties with evolutionary theory, it should be noted that the movie also makes extensive efforts to clarify the way that evolution really works, although it leaves out the small detail that the X-Men are a massive exaggeration.In comparison with the original movie, X2 was a hugely entertaining and well-made action film, just like X1, but it is the story that has evolved more than anything else. I loved the introduction of a new bad guy who forced the X-Men to come together, although the movie did tend to trip over itself at some points, such as with the paper-thin content of the meaning and need for the little boy with the freaky tongue. (spoilers) I was disappointed with the fate of Jean Grey, even if only because her `death' was so avoidable. It was never explained very clearly why she didn't stay on the jet and use all of her energy to lift the jet itself out of the path of the oncoming water instead of getting off and trying to levitate the jet while stopping the water at the same time. Even if exiting the jet was absolutely necessary, there is really no fathomable reason why, given the fact that she held the water back that long and was ultimately able to stop her efforts at lifting the jet, she could not let the water gradually come to her and slowly engulf her so that she could swim and wait for the jet to come back and pick her up.At any rate, if her death was necessary for furthering the story or for preparing for the next film (the creation of a third X-Men is an absolute certainty, after all), then I suppose I can understand it, but making Jean's death necessary and making it believable are two of the weakest parts of the film. On the positive side, however, Hugh Jackman was given the opportunity to prove his effectiveness in performing emotionally charged scenes while playing a comic book character (which is certainly a daunting task).Speaking of weak parts of the film, by the way, there is also Magneto's escape. Not only does Mystique inject a massive amount of `iron' into the body of one of Magneto's prison guards without killing him (there are VERY few things that can be injected directly into the blood stream in that quantity without resulting in almost immediate death, and iron in ANY form is NOT one of them), but Magneto also manages to latch on to all of that iron and pull it out of the guard's body, using the nice little ball-bearings that he gets out of him to escape. However, even the most basically educated members of the audience, who realize that the iron in your blood is not exactly metal, will probably appreciate the way this was pulled off (that is, of course, if they were able to see the screen enough while repeatedly slapping their foreheads in disbelief).
I have never been into comic books, I don't think I've ever even seen a copy of an X-Men comic, but even coming into the films completely new like that I enjoyed both of them and I think they were both remarkably well-made. It is a sign of deserving respect when a movie or series of movies based on comics books or cartoons or old TV shows or something can entertain an audience that is not familiar with the original material (this is not true for example, according to Roger Ebert, of the recent Scooby-Doo film, which I have yet to see or develop any interest in seeing). With that in mind, I think it would be appropriate to end by emphasizing the sheer broadness of the target audience. Kids will love the characters and the fighting and special effects, high school and college age kids will appreciate the same things as well as the intricacy of the story (adults will more than likely appreciate this as well), and, as was the case with the first film, just about every male in the audience of any age and sexual orientation will appreciate the astronomical hotness of Mystique, which translated from the first film to this one quite well. I don't have much to say in defense of the little stunt that Magneto pulled in pulling the `iron' out of the guard's blood in order to escape, although even that was convincingly done. As with all movies, X2 has its faults, but it is definitely a worthy follow-up to the original, which was something of a tough act to follow.","

The characters are great as always & there's some great effects to be had here which do improve upon the first film a bit.The film does drag somewhat & is 2 hours long exactly. It didn't have bad pacing, but it did begin to drag in the last 30 odd minutes. There is plenty of action to be had, so while it does drag a little & is a bit long, there's always action to be had here in this 120 minute flick, so you won't be too disappointed.Overall, it's above average, compared to the first which was pretty good, this is a slight step down, but not by much.

Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is continuing his fight to get mutants equally accepted into a society that fears them. Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still locked up in his plastic prison. Surprisingly, Magneto is not the primary villain this time, now it's William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who seeks to eradicate mutants once and for all, with the help of Yuriko Oyama a.k.a.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ebiros2","4 October 2005","I think people have already agreed on the fact that this is the best comic to movie translation ever done (perhaps until X3), so I won't get into that.What makes this movie so good when I total the tally can be squarely put on one director: Bryan Singer (And no, I'm not a friend of his or being compensated by him in any ways). What makes this movie better than other Marvel translations into the big screen is the following: First of all, casting is perfect (or direction is good enough to mask any flaws in casting). They're not selecting the actors based on their previous work but is an uniquely original mix of talent that when brought together, works. The cinematography is also excellent with special effects, props, lighting, background, color and mood is perfectly integrated on each scene. Plot and subplots all enhance the interesting quality of each superhero and villain, and it's not just a blurr of characters showing their super powers one after another.The movie shows that you can be respectful to the original plot of the comic and yet tell a meaningful story in 2 hours. Unlike some other movies that are just superficial translation of character's name, costume, and powers. How deep the script writing, and screen play went into digging into the interesting aspects of the original comic is evident in this movie, and bringing them into life in the big screen shows the true genius of people who've worked on it.I just wished that all other movie rendition of Marvel superheros are as good as this one. But for now, I'll be satisfied that at least one director's got it right.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","miredita","4 May 2003","***WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT***              ***WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT***There are some great moments in this film, the beginning sequence of course, but others as well: cameos by Colossus and Kitty Pryde; the touching and dramatic scenes at Bobby Drake's parents' house; the nice but all-too brief scene with Storm and Nightcrawler discussing religious faith and the struggle to survive; the siege on X-Mansion and Wolverine doing a ""Weapon X""-like counterattack on the intruders; the escape of Magneto; well I could go on and on -- this movie has a lot of moments but ultimately I think it fails to gel as a whole picture. The many new characters were a welcome addition and the movie clocked in at a healthy 2 1/4 hours, which should've been enough to do justice to all the storylines. At times though I felt the movie sacrificed character focus and dramatic build-up for plot efficiency and needless ""show"" scenes. What follows is a mix of cheers and jeers.Certain moments could've been left out entirely (and I know many will disagree with me on this) - to begin, the Lady Deathstrike/Wolverine encounter at the end was a disappointment. You knew it was coming the entire time (from the previews, mainly) and it was too short and served no real purpose other to show-off some cool effects. In my opinion this whole sequence could have been edited out since it added nothing and didn't deliver even as a side-item. In contrast the Sabretooth/Wolverine final conflict in the first movie was more effective because the personal animosity between them had been established early on. I think bringing in the fact that Wolverine and Sabretooth once worked together as allies with Stryker (again going back to the books) would have been a very effective and suitable subplot. I guess Tyler Mane wasn't interested in an encore.The ending was very reminiscent of ""Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan"" and the death of Spock and his eventual return, and yes, I understood the Phoenix reference from the comic storyline. However, I think that was a misplaced concept -- did anyone noticed that noone even bothered to find Jean's body? It's not like it was incinerated (like in the original Phoenix story), this is a flood! I guess they don't believe in ""leaving no man behind."" Or am I missing something here? If they weren't able to find it, that's one thing, but they didn't even bother to look for it (for Scott and Logan's sake if nothing else). In addition, this was supposed to be the unexpected dramatic high point of the movie, but there wasn't any dramatic build-up to it -- it just happened (in contrast, consider the ending of STII which was alluded to in various ways through the entire movie, thus creating a dramatic build-up and a more satisfying result).Professor X again gets incapacitated here, though he isn't taken out most of the movie as in the first one. Patrick Stewart is an incredible actor, and sad to say but he made many of the other actors look simply boring. I would like to have seen Jason survive the ordeal with Xavier, after all, wouldn't a mutant capable of controlling Professor X be worth having as a possible ally? Especially when his greatest enemy (his father) is now (presumably) dead. As with Jean, though, they left him behind to get crushed by the collapsing Cerebro.As far as characters go, my biggest problem here is with Storm: when she was discovered (in the comic series) she was an African queen using her weather powers to (benevolently) rule over her people, very dramatic personality. This personal history would create a more intense personality-type for anyone. However, for the first movie and this one she is simply another somewhat introverted and angry mutant. I don't know whether it's by design or not, but I think Halle Berry *IS CAPABLE* of playing a character with a showy personality. I mean if you could control the weather and used to be a queen, wouldn't you have a more extroverted personality? I don't understand the reasoning behind this. She's always been one of my favorite characters in the books BECAUSE of this rich mix of personality and powers.Wolverine didn't take center stage like in the first movie, but once again he was one of the bright spots. The casting choice was and remains perfect. I would've preferred a return of Sabretooth (thus continuing the drama from the first movie) over the brief and wasted introduction/demise of Lady Deathstrike (who was never even named in this movie).The Stryker character was effective, especially the scene where he was describing how his wife took a power drill to her temple in an attempt to release the illusions that her son was planting in her mind. I think Stryker's relationship with Wolverine was one of the better developed subplots.And how could I leave out Mystique, who was definitely the eye-pleaser of the movie (for us guys that is). It would be nice to have Storm's personality developed along those same lines as a counterweight. Every scene she was in was worth the price of admission. Great action, wonderfully mischievous and sneaky character. Another perfect casting choice! Loved the Mystique/Wolverine seduction scene (and who was that blond she appeared as in the bar?)And like Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan is a wonder to behold, I actually enjoyed him more in this one as a sort of Hannibal Lecter-type. The brief interplay between him and Pyro was great, definitely a good choice for a protege. Again a perfect casting choice.Pyro (John) was a wonderful addition here as the mutant with an attitude. Great personality, at the same time sympathetic, the kind of bad kid you definitely want on your side. That whole scene at Bobby Drake's folks' house (including the few tender moments Bobby and Rogue spent together) was excellent. Very memorable, very dramatic. I should add that Rogue and Bobby had great chemistry here both and Rogue's brief appearances were NOT wasted (after all she ""persuaded"" Pyro to stand down from his fiery assault on the cops).The best new addition was, hands-down, Nightcrawler, played to perfection here......using CORRECT German, I might add (even when he was praying). I really wanted to see more of him, he sort of took a back seat for the second half of the movie. Maybe some flashbacks of his past as a circus freak would've been a nice touch. The introduction of a significant religious element here is a nice touch. And the involved make-up could not be improved upon.Jean's personality came out more in this movie (she was rather flat in the first one), and her scenes with Wolverine were great. I think her unfocused condition and ultimate ""demise"" should have been developed more throughout to give the ending more a reason-to-be. Maybe in the next one her return as Phoenix (though I still fail to see how a flood will cause this -- being consumed by fire and rising from the ashes, that is what a Phoenix is) will create a much more forceful personality for Jean (and maybe force Storm to come out of her shell as well). I wouldn't mind seeing more personal histories overall in the next one as well (as we have gotten nothing so far about Scott and Jean's past).Overall I recommend this movie: it has a more substantial plot and many improvements over the first installment. But I think it could have spent more time developing the quieter moments to give the dramatic moments greater impact. Some of these worked (Bobby's folks, Nightcrawler in the church) but the more crucial ones didn't (Jean's self-sacrifice). It would have made the movie longer to do so, but, hey if it works, who cares? Maybe some of these will show up on the DVD as deleted scenes or (better) a restored director's cut. Still, lessons learned for the next installment - maybe the third time's the charm.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","DeadlyHedley007","14 November 2004","I enjoyed X-Men very much but X-2 excelled in all parts but particularly Hugh Jackman. This multi talented actor can bring all the action, pathos, anxiety, happiness and sorrow to a character of fantasy just imagine what he can do in the real world.The film held my attention completely to the end. All the characters had moved on from the 1st film particularly Wolverine who is now the top character in the series.The action scenes were outstanding - I bet there were quite a few cuts and bruises before the climax of the film and make up and wardrobe really made their mark, But the commitment and hard work of the cast, back stage and the fore sight of Brian Singer really made this a film far more worthy in the ratings that we gave it. Everyone worked together to make it work and the all got on very well - what more can I sayThere is room for another X-men film particularly the many unanswered questions in respect of Logan/Wolverine. He convinced me that although he could not remember what had happened to him or why, that behind this lay a very profound and misused good guy - even though he was told 'he was a wolf and only had the claws added' but then the bad guys do try to destroy good men. Interesting concept as to where it would go and how. Needs far more imagination that I can produce -bet there is a hell of a story yet to come either in the X-Men 3 and/or plus a spin off of Wolverine. I could not imagine X-Men 3 without Wolverine it would not work. Although I would not like to Hugh Jackman stuck in a rut he is capable of so much more and I am sure he would want to do much. He has it to offer and deliver. So come on you top directors don't get in a rut get the multi talented Mr Jackman before you miss him. He has more than proved himself on the stage - there is no reason without a good director and particularly an excellent script an Oscar would be on the way to him and a very rewarding film for all with awards to all concerned. He has more than earned the chance - even his small roles always have good things to say about his performances.Deadly Hedley","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","generationofswine","20 November 2016","X-Men 2, X2, it's really not the right title is it? At least not for comic book fans. It should have been Weapon X, that is really the story-arc that they were depicting and, honestly, it worked just as well on film as it did in the comics.Although, I would consider it one of the best X-Men movies, it does have more of a comic book feel that seems a little less serious and more fantasy than then reboots...and that is not necessarily a bad thing.In other words, not matter how serious the first Singer films get, there is still an element of fun that is hard to really capture in a franchise that is lately trying way too hard to bank on dark and often times failing.The focus in this is Wolverine.Was it Steve Jobs that said ""Find out what the people want and then give it to them?"" In any case, that is exactly what they did with X2, just like in the comics, the audience wanted more Wolverine and they gave him to us in X2, an entire plot that revolved as much around him as it did the rest of the team with the promise at the end of more Wolverine to come.It brings us to the heart of the Weapon X program with a plot that hinted, if vaguely, at the 1990s tumultuous story arc that brought about the Age of Apocalypse and instead promised to continue the franchise with the Dark Phoenix Saga from the 80s.The movie was great, it was honestly a ton of fun and remains one of the best of X-Men franchise, the set up for the continuation was perfect...unfortunately they switched Captains after X2 and almost killed it entirely.Now it remains a shining example of what could have been. Even then, this remains that one, if you are only going to see one X-Men movie, make sure it's X2, it sits at the top of the franchise.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","funnycommentor","1 August 2022","The plot of the sequel was interesting, but it wasn't as good as the original. The storyline was kinda well-written, but it was boring. The characters were well-developed and very interesting. It wasn't as intense as the first movie and there weren't many fight scenes. In my opinion, the first movie was way better than the second movie. The duration of the movie was way higher than the first movie, which was kinda unnecessary. The casting was kinda the same and the acting was as good as the first movie. The graphics and the effects were really cool. The ending scene was unexpected. I hope the third movie is gonna be better...! Last but not least, I hope we will have the chance to get to know more about the mutant's powers on the next few movies.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","noralee","10 May 2003","I'll call it ""X Men 2: X Men United,"" but I don't remember seeing the subtitle in the credits; I more remember the key letter in Fox network constantly turning into ""X Men"" during the barrage of ads on the TV.
Turns out I should have re-viewed the prequel ""X Men"" because this picks up exactly where the last one left off and there's many references to previous happenings (hmm, what was that about those scars?) -- but then I was the oldest person at the morning showing.Director/story writer Bryan Singer has learned the lesson of successful comic book/super heroes' movies that it's the relationships stupid, though the kids in the audience do get restless during the scenes and dialogue that appealed to me (like the mutants looking longingly at warm family photographs with one who is about to ""come out"" to his parents) more than the predictable special effects (after all, what were we supposed to think would happen to a super secret hideaway built under a huge concrete dam?).
There are a lot of good actors slumming here (Brian Cox's and Hugh Jackman's accents slip at the start but get stronger), giving the sidelong glances, sexual temptations, and repartee more gravitas than they were written with. Jackman also committed a lot of time to a trainer and nutritionist to develop that non-CGI body that fills the screen quite charismatically -- and aids the joke when he sardonically explains his teaching role at the school for the gifted.While the women get crucial plot points, the actresses don't have a lot to do; not much Famke Janssen can do with her telekinetic Phoenix power but scowl or Halle Berry cloud over her eyes as the weather gets Storm-ized. I'm sure these women would have had more ideas about mutant foreplay to respond to the ongoing guy-to-guy running query to Iceman on how he and Rogue (of the lifeforce squeezing power) manage their budding romance than ""We're working on it.""Alan Cummings leaving everyone in the blue dust of his teleporting mutant is fun and cool (and I enjoyed his repetition of his origins that reminded me of a running gag in ""Due South."" )I did find a couple of plot points confusing, but could connect my own dots.
The music never stops pounding, but then it was written by the editor.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","rogerdarlington","13 May 2003","Rule One of successful sequels: reprise the main characters.  The noble Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his friend Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the sinister Magneto (Ian McKellan) and his aide Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and most of the other mutants from the original movie are back with their varied gifts. Rule Two: introduce some new characters. So this time we have Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox), a human who is as nefarious as any mutant, and some new mutants, including blue-skinned, German-speaking (really!) Kurt Wagner (Alan Cumming) and metal-taloned Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu).
Rule Three: better the effects. While some of the scenery looks obviously artificial, generally the effects are extremely well-done with some great form-changing sequences.Rule Four: develop the narrative. Ah, there's the rub ..
The pacing of the sequel is better than the original, because we don't have all that scene-setting, but instead more sustained action. But the storyline is weak, when it isn't confused. And the script - with the rare good line (""You are a god among insects"") - is banal. Where the X-men franchise scores over super-heroes such as Spiderman or Daredevil is that there are so many special powers to display. The down-side though is that the multitude of players allows no space for character exploration or development. So, the film is fun, furious but ultimately froth. I expected a lot of the original and was a rather disappointed but, this time, I knew what to expect and it delivered on that limited level.","

X2 is similar to the first film, but it's enhanced with a darker streak in it. It takes our favourite characters and shows off what they can do with their abilities. It adds to the love story of Jean Gray and Wolverine. And it digs deeper into the story of the characters, revealing new secrets.I really loved everything about the movie. If you are a fan of the first film, then I strongly recommend this one. It has the original cast that we fell in love with and adds new characters with new abilities, that enhance the story. Its a serious and intense plot that takes the viewer on a fun ride. Cleverly written and well acted out.","

The story begins with an unforeseen force attacking and killing the mutants and Professor Xavier is trying to get to the bottom of it.

This leads Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to discovers the identity of his creator as well as the secret of his past. The high technology of this one is even flashier and greater than the first and the characters are sexier and pumped up for action. Rebecca De Mornay shines more in her role this time around.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","jldmp1","23 June 2006","Accepting the homosexuality of others is, to my way of thinking, an enriching virtue...I have people in my life close to me who happen to be gay, and I'm about as straight and happily married as anyone can imagine.So what are we to make of Singer's self-referential narratives of dealing with homophobia (it's less blatant in the first ""X-Men"")? Well, for starters we don't have much of a movie vision here, with the exception of the opening attack on the Oval Office. Plainly, a different production team was in charge of delivering a knock out first punch. The rest of this is just a flat morality play, the sort of thing that aims for a target containing ""Spartacus"" and ""La Cage.../The Birdcage"", while using big, colorful characters.Shamefully, Singer approaches this from the angle of Bush-bashing (forgetting or ignoring that VP Cheney's daughter is openly and unapologetically gay - a fact that cost Bush some support from the Movement Right) and blaming the evil Republicans for all the woes of those ""who are different""...a mother asks her son if he'd tried 'not being a mutant'...a father reprograms his 'deviant' son -- by the way, he's named Stryker after Julius Streicher, the infamous Jew-baiter and Nazi war criminal -- to suggest the US government supports this is deeply offensive.Singer is a person who is granted the extraordinary power of directing a series about people who are granted extraordinary powers...and sadly, all he can offer us here is cheap, hackneyed moralizing.Let's see Singer use some real power to take on the 'People's Republic' of China, where gays are routinely incarcerated in mental asylums. Or follow the example of John Maynard Keynes, a gay man who changed the way the world thinks about economics (whether you agree with Keynes or not), and direct his powers at things other than preening and profiteering.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","19 September 2017","In the 1980s and 1990s, Marvel wasn't the company it has become today: the company teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and they had to auction off the film-rights of its characters ranging from Spiderman, Captain America, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men to film companies that included Sony, Fox, Paramount, Universal and New Line Cinema (oddly Disney didn't have the rights for ANY Marvel characters before buying the company outright in 2009, for $4 billion). Does this film honor its source material? Yes it does.X-Men 2 is easily one of the finer fruits coming from Marvel's circumstantial deal-brokering and near-bankruptcy in the 80s and 90s. Hugh Jackson, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are the stars of the show here, and they're in a much higher-stakes adventure than the original X-Men. Humans and mutants are on the brink of all-out war with each other (as they always are in these movies), and the X-Men are the arbiters of justice stopping all that chaos from hitting the world.While the film has become slightly dated with its effects, it's still a good Marvel-yarn and respectable take on everyone's favourite mutants.","

Magneto is still up to no good and a new enemy surfaces, Stryker, who seems to have a past with Wolverine. Wolverine tries to find answers to his past through this mysterious man who wants to kidnap mutants. X2 opens with a bang and is one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. We are introduced to a popular x-men character, who is visualized perfectly and is one of the best character adaptations the films have ever done and the sequence itself is entertaining. So much that it immediately grabs you and tells you that this film is a sequel that outshines the original and it does. Bryan Singer took the flaws of the original and fixed them here, he makes a sequel that is not only bigger, but better. Many times sequels fall under it's own need to do things on a grander scale, but here it works. We are introduced to some new characters, such as Nightcrawler, Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. All three of these characters shine in this film and elevate it to making this sequel the best in the series. Deathstrike has a brutal and violent fight scene with Wolverine, it seems he has finally me his match this time around. Styker is played by Brian Cox, he is deliciously evil and a nice face to see against the x-men then just having it be Magneto again. The action sequences are better here, more rough and tough. They are choreographed to make it not only more real, but more entertaining. They fit the comic book form a little more here than in the previous installment. The risk in this film seems a bit greater as well, the stakes are risen in the sequel and it makes us care more about the characters and the outcome then what one would initially think.Halle Berry and her role as Storm is still one of the weakest parts of the series. Her lines fall flat and her sincerity doesn't seem genuine. Her bits with Nightcrawler seem forced and she somehow manages to take one of the coolest characters from the comics and make her quite lame here. James Marsden improves here as Cyclops, he has more emotional baggage to carry here than last time. It's always hard to act when your eyes are covered, I give him credit despite having less screen time.This film is darker, not everyone makes it out alive. It sets up one of the best story lines the comics have ever introduced, the Dark Phoenix Saga. The script is tighter as is the acting. Rogue is still an annoying teen, but she has matured a bit since last time. The special effects are improved and the direction is more polished. If I were to point anyone into the direction of an x-men film, this is the one I'd tell them to watch.","

It takes all the good parts of the original X- Men movie and makes them better, while virtually eliminating the flaws. It comfortably sits on the top tier of super-hero movies, with Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight. It's no coincidence that all three of those movies had fairly strong bases to build on, and kept the directors from the previous film.This time around, the Brotherhood and the X-Men are tentatively united against a massive threat to all mutant-kind. The movie begins brilliantly, with one of the most impressive, memorable, and complex scenes ever seen in a movie of this kind...and surprisingly, that level of quality is kept for the entire rest of X2. From the brutal fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, to the rather perfect ending, this is the definitive X-Men movie that we all wanted.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","brando647","24 September 2007","Wow. Just...wow. This movie turned out to be everything I had hoped the first X-Men film would be. Plenty of action, plenty of story, and terrific performances from the cast. I had a couple of complaints about the introduction to one of my favorite Marvel franchises, but all of those complaints are gone with the newest installment. The movie begins with strength (a great scene of Nightcrawler attacking the White House) and doesn't slow down until the end credits roll.Of course, one of the best things to look forward to when a new X-Men film is being released is ""What new characters are they bringing in this time?"" and once again, Singer brings nothing but the best. The sequel introduces Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming does an awesome job with one of my favorite X-Men), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu). As for Brian Cox, I enjoy watching him in just about any role, and he brings a perfect restrained hatred to the character of William Stryker, the military scientist whose plans bring the X-Men and Brotherhood to work together. I was also happy to see that Bobby Drake (Iceman) was given a larger role; seeing as how in the comics, Iceman was one of the first X-Men, I thought they severely underused him in the first film.Since a majority of the characters were introduced already, Singer didn't have to slow things down this time around so the audience could get to know everyone. Where I thought the first film had a handful of moments that dragged, this one has none. Despite that this movie times at just over 2 hours, it feels like it flies by. Even better, the action in this movie is more brutal, showing more of what Wolverine is capable of (he IS the best at what he does, after all...). We even get a better glimpse at the mutants' powers in action with special effects that are even better than last time.The one and only problem with the film was pretty much unavoidable. In a movie with a cast this large, some characters are bound to be underused. I thought Deathstrike was a great addition to the roster, but she is only given ONE line and ONE fight scene (granted, it's a freakin' awesome fight). The character of Colossus was brought in (FINALLY!) but only made a brief appearance. But, I do understand the limits when trying to include so many people in a single movie and I don't let it get to me.This movie is yet another example that a sequel can surpass the original. I couldn't be happier with the latest in the franchise and this movie is going to rank high as my favorite movies for years to come.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","ametaphysicalshark","23 March 2009","I'm definitely not a fan of Bryan Singer. Not in the slightest. The man manages to consistently annoy me with his mediocrity as director, and while his work is not staggeringly bad to the point that ""X2"" doesn't work, it does prevent the film from reaching its massive potential. I don't think I'm a fan of the X-Men universe either, the concepts, the themes, the characters, at all, and it is testament to the quality of ""X2"" as a standalone story that I found ""X2"" overall to be one of the better blockbusters of the decade, though Singer single-handedly keeps it from being on par with the few great comic book-based films.It helps, of course, that Hugh Jackman's wonderful Wolverine, easily the most interesting and likable character in these films, is perhaps the main emotional focus of the film, or maybe it's just that I was most drawn to his story. To my surprise and excitement the rest of the film this time around is as good as Wolverine is (well, not really, but good regardless). The concepts presented in the first film and the obvious metaphoric significance of the mutants and the way society treats them are not merely presented as in the first film but expanded on and are actually overall quite interesting and well-handled. Of course the film is not intellectual and remains a summer blockbuster, but it's not as dumb as I expected it to be.Overall as a total outsider whose only familiarity with the X-Men universe and characters I found ""X2"" a surprisingly rewarding film after being slightly disappointed by the decent but underwhelming ""X-Men"". This film is richer, bigger, smarter, and features better storytelling than the first film, as well as more convincing characterizations. Bryan Singer is not the worst director around and I'm sure Brett Ratner messed things up far more, but I still found Singer's work to be uninspired and disappointing. This film could've been an absolute knockout, but I found too much of it visually bland or occasionally downright annoying for me to really fall in love with the movie. I expected ""X2"" to disappoint after its excellent opening scene, but it was consistently entertaining and even emotionally involving at times.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","raysond","13 May 2003","Let's see. It has been three years since the last installment of the series based on the characters from Marvel Comics,but lets just say that this one has live up to its reputation. The second installment to the series,""X2:X-Men United"" is going to really satisfy its fans from the first one,including zealous devotees of the comic books that spawned the flicks. With this new installment,director Bryan Singer is able to leap into the foray without the cumbersome character and situation setups needed for the initial film,so with this one,""X2"" rips along at a faster pace,pulsing with wilder action sequences and more dazzling visual effects than ever before. Also added to the new mix and a new batch of characters mixed in with some of their most deadliest rivals,but in this one unlike the first,it sees the two rival mutant factions(led by Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellan's Magneto) join forces over a governmental society that wants to get rid of mutants and here is where the action really flies off the ground,and it doesn't disappoint. Also,this one is more darker and longer than the first one(over two hours long)and it also explores into each one of mutants capablities. Call this one a installment worth waiting for,and it shows as one of the first post-September 11th blockbusters of the summer. Rating: ****1/2 out of ***** stars.","

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","PatrynXX","16 May 2003","(spoilers??)It's as though they attempted to overplot the movie.  I sometimes complain about poor plots.  This movie is over plotted.  They tried to shove to much story into the 2 hours they had.  In some instances, it created utter confusion.  It certainly wasn't as fun as the first.  The first movie had a comic book feel to it.  The second one is taking itself too seriously.  The score is somehow different and not as inventive.  Some of the special effects really suck, but in other cases it's amazing.Then there's the obvious spoiler.  Throughout the movie they hint at something going on with Jean Grey.  So when you think she's buried under all that ice, was that really what happened.  So I had to ask an x men fan about that.  I guess most of them are laughing at those who think she's dead.  Oh well. ;)Another gripe, the first movie was more open to outsiders.  You know, people who arn't X-Men fans.  X2 as they now call it (which will be really stupid if they call it X3 later....  Vin Diesel's gonna get some nasty one's on that.)  is not open to outsiders.  There's alot of need to know beforehand that you indeed need to know before watching the movie.  Frankly outsiders like myself will get utterly lost. So here's my bit, outsiders, get some education in the land of X-Men.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","newfiesailor","28 April 2006","A polished comic book adaptation, darker and grittier than the first in the series. I think it lacks the fun factor the original had, mainly due to the content. Still, it is hard not to admire Singer's faithfulness to the comic.This time around we have Nightcrawler, Iceman and Pyro joining the crew as well as cameos by Hank McCoy (aka Beast), Siryn, Jubilee, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (aka Shadowcat). Lady Deathstryke is deadly as the evil counterpart to Wolverine; their one on one battle, one of the highlights of the film. Still, Alan Cummings steals this movie as the shy and sensitive Nightcrawler whose make up gets the first star. The opening scene as he invades the White House is sheer popcorn fun.The nemesis this time around is William Stryker, played gleefully sinister and corrupt by the always marvelous, Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lecter). Stryker has it in for the mutants and his presence lends some insight into the creation of Wolverine. Magneto is back, the fuel for the fire of his hatred against humans rekindled by Stryker's actions. His aide, Mystique, played by the delicious Rebecca Romijn, is given a larger role as the deceiver and spy which adds more fun factor to the film. Plus she is easy on the eyes.I really didn't enjoy the subplot of Professor X and Stryker's son, Jason. I found it too dark to really get swept away in the film. The rest of the film is pure Saturday matinÃ©e enjoyment. I cannot wait to see the outcome of Jean Grey's metamorphosis into Dark Phoenix, insinuated at the end of this film. All in all, a good romp, well worth a rental or buy of the DVD and promises a great chapter to come in X3.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","RNMorton","24 September 2004","Unique - a special effects extravaganza SEQUEL with fascinating, well-played characters and a truly scary plot. Professor X, the X-Men, their arch-enemy Magneto and his cronies find themselves sort of on the same team against absolutely evil mutant killer. McKellen and Stewart really fit and play off each other as well as any two actors in movies today. I was disappointed by underwritten Paquin role while Jackman continues to grow as a lead, they almost have too many good characters to spread enough around. *Spoiler* Docked two entire points (the biggest penalty ever!) for two major killings late in the movie - they occurred in the film's two hokiest sequences and proved absolutely nothing. If they felt like they had to kill the characters off they could have picked a more poignant reason and scenario than they did. There's a lot to work with here if they can just keep themselves under control. 8 of 10 (after assessment of the penalty)",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","I've often held that the sequel of a superhero film is better than the original. Most superhero film franchises start out with an origin story, so by the time the second film comes around, all the ""exposition"" is out of the way and the heroes can really take on some powerful villains. However, since X-Men (2000) didn't have much of an origin story, its sequel, X2 is almost relegated to the fate of a ""flashback"" sequel. Still, the darker tone does help set it apart from its predecessor, which is nice.Granted, the choice of exploring Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) past was a good one, considering the strength of the character. Heck, he got two more movies outside the main X-Men saga, so clearly he's a fan favorite. What's nice about the superhero sequel is that most comic book story arcs are short enough that they can be incorporated into a single film. In this way, X2 could almost stand by itself, much like its predecessor could. In fact, X2 almost follows the same formula as X-Men by not actually delving too deep into any single character's origin story. All the supporting characters are useful and relevant, which is important for a series that relies on the teamwork of a group of mutants.This film also mostly avoided the trope I like to identify as ""the trilogy conundrum"". Because it could stand alone as its own film, especially for those already familiar with the characters and premise, there isn't a need for it to be a cliffhanger to motivate people to see the third film in the trilogy. If you can ignore the glow in the water at the end of the film, it hardly has much of a connection to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) at all.Pretty good as far as first sequels go, I give X-Men 2 3.5 stars out of 5.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","pyrocitor","18 May 2008","The X-Men series has always demonstrated more promising opportunities for deeper poignancy than the typical superpowered slugfest, a trait which director Bryan Singer embraced for the first film adaptation of the timeless comic book series. And while the fear that the unique gravitas and social scope of the first film might be lost in a flurry of mindless action associated with the typical sequel, X2 exceeds any seemingly insurmountable expectations by exemplifying and even expanding upon every successful element of the first, making its mark as one of the few sequels to not only match but surpass the quality of its predecessor. What could have been simply played as an all out action film instead retains laudable cultural context, as returning director Singer tackles his source material with a slightly more fun, enjoyable tone without losing an ounce of the serious realism or societal commentary which permeated his first effort. As prejudice towards mutants becomes more pronounced and the rift between them and ""normal"" humans grows ever larger, morally ambiguous fields emerge and extremes are taken by both sides of the issue to eliminate the other, giving the film ample opportunity to touch upon issues of discrimination (Iceman's ""coming out"" scene to his parents draws explicitly poignant parallels to homosexual repression) or other issues of impressive complexity for a superhero blockbuster. As such, certain storyline similarities to the first do emerge, but these are hardly apparent and utterly insignificant in the face of such a uniformly superb work. The film's clever script balances its wide array of characters just so unlike the slightly rushed and chaotic feel of the third instalment, as each character shines given their appropriate moment without the film ever feeling cluttered or imbalanced. Similarly, many knowing winks of humour result from throwaway references for fans of the comics (watch for fleeting mentions of Gambit, Sebastian Shaw and Dr. Henry McCoy) without ever jeopardising the credibility of the film. The film similarly boasts more streamlined action setpieces than its predecessor (Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House is a breathless, superbly gripping piece of work), as computer animation is seamlessly melded with practical effects and makeup, culminating in a laudably realistic depiction of superpowered beings in a frighteningly real world. The quality cast inhabit the potentially daunting material with a passionate urgency, fusing potentially laughable subject matter into an affecting and exhilarating work. Reprising his defining role, Hugh Jackman once again effortlessly essays the animalistic charm of the savage Wolverine, his roguish charisma remaining pitch perfect for the role. The calm dignity of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan provide dramatic backbone as opposing mutant figureheads, the peace seeking Professor Charles Xavier and ruthless war mongering Magneto, bringing class and distinction to the film and helping to sell many of the less realistic moments while also both demonstrating surprising vulnerability during respective captivity sequences. Returning cast members Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and James Marsden continue to impress, expanding upon their previous incarnations of their roles, and Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore contribute a surprisingly feasible youthful existentialism subplot. Despite minimally written roles, Rebecca Romijn and Kelly Hu provide suitable menace instead of simply statuesque forms as the shapeshifting Mystique and ominous villainous Deathstrike respectively.Yet most commendable are the new cast members, as Brian Cox chews scenery with the utmost of bottled fury as military extremist William Stryker and Aaron Stanford inhabits simmering defiance like a second skin as the unpredictable Pyro. Yet the film's most resonant and ultimately affecting performance without question is provided by Alan Cumming as outcast teleporter Nightcrawler. His soulful interior poignantly counterbalancing his demonic exterior, Nightcrawler serves as a figurehead for humanity's close-minded discrimination, and Cumming's masterclass of a performance extracts every possible ounce of humanity and sympathy from the character - one of the most moving and fervently felt performances ever seen in a comic book adaptation. With exquisitely thrilling action to put most summer blockbusters to shame and an undercurrent of thought provoking profundity which could give most dramas a run for their money, X2 proves an almost faultless piece of quality film-making as well as easily one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever released. Even those usually put off by superhero films will have much to appreciate, and fans of such material will be hard pressed to find a film nearly as bombastically satisfying as X2. -9.5/10",NA

Many reviewers here have already told enough about the plot of this film so I wont add more to what they have said regarding that plot. I'm only going to write about how this film made me feel..and that was fantastic. This sequel took chances, had a strong message and didn't back down from you knowing who was 'good' and who was 'bad'..on both sides of the coin.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","geckorion","2 May 2003","One would think that when a trailer for a movie gets a minute-long ovation, the following movie is doomed to unmet expectation. However, in the case of X2, people forgot the impending Matrix sequel and found themselves engrossed in probably the best comic superhero movie ever made (yes that includes all the Batmans, Supermans, Spider-man, Punisher, etc.).What made this movie so special was not the special effects nor the high popularity of the X-men in print.  Rather it was the fact that the writing and consequently the acting in this movie far exceeded the first movie and most other action-genre films. How this franchise landed both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, I shall never know but I thank my lucky stars everyday that Singer got these two amazing actors, for it is Magneto and Professor X that all the other mutants get their strength (emotionally as well as physically).Anyway, I will not give away the plot as I sometimes do in my reviews, because I realize how disappointing it is to know the end without being surprised or figuring it out on your own. What surprised me most about this movie is how so many competing love storylines were going on and how well they were written.  In action movies, and all movies for that matter, love triangles become incredibly cliched and unoriginal.  However, this movie manages to pull off all the jealousies and lusts even before relying upon shape-shifting and illusion.Also may I say that I am glad that Jean Grey and Storm did something in this movie.  Cyclops still didn't, but he'll be gone by the next movie anyway (not a spoiler, just an opinion).  Grey and Storm were just really hot women in leather in the first movie, while Wolverine and Rogue commanded the entire story.  This movie had about three times as many characters and still managed to have many more deep, complex, inter-woven story paths to follow.Now on to the special effects.  The opening Nightcrawler sequence is one of the most thrilling action sequences in recent years, again probably due to the lifting of the bar by, you guessed it--The Matrix.  Nightcrawler's unique abilty of transporting, is visually and audibly (his popping in and out of thin air sounded really cool)incredible.My favorite improvement in this movement though has got to be the character of Mystique.  In the first movie she was one of the goons- a hot, shape-shifting goon- but completely lineless and characterless.In this movie she had depth (and lines) as well as way more impressive fight sequences. She was probably as important if not more than Magneto in this movie- I am not kidding.Anyway this is going on long enough so I will leave you with this:  If you like the X-men, or action movies, or Sci-fi/fantasy you will probably love this.  If not you can probably at least find a reason that it was worth your $8.50.",NA

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Victor Field","17 October 2004","Warning: This has a slight spoiler.If the ""Justice League of America"" pilot had been treated with the TLC that ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" got, the pilot would have not only sold but the series that would have resulted would still be running. One good movie from the concept would have been a blessing, but for ""X2"" to continue the tradition is... all sequels should be this good. Not good enough to top the first one, but good enough to be an equal.Like all good sequels, this expands on the previous movie rather than rehashes it (the basic story has good and bad mutants alike teaming up to combat a common threat, but there's obviously more to it than that); there's more emphasis on story than setting up the characters (though kudos to writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter for giving space to both), although with so many characters a few slip through the cracks - minor ones, like the girl who can walk through walls, are one thing (although I wanted to see a bit more of her), but it's a bit hard to keep track of all of them. Not that it ever degenerates into confusion, though; it often plays like a live action take on those superb WB cartoons. Yes, that's a compliment. As well as keeping up the interesting aspects of its story while not overdoing the bigotry angle of its premise (some have called the relationship between Storm and Nightcrawler a romance, but they seem to bond more on a friendly level than a lovey-dovey one), the movie also has plenty for the more shallow viewers Â the non-stop action and the special effects aside, the ladies are, I understand, best catered for with Hugh Jackman (far better here than as Van Helsing) and James Marsden, while the gentlemen get Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (whose Mystique gets more to do (and say) this time around, and even appears without the blue skin at one point) and Kelly Hu.

YES!)SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.Although three of them won't be back for 'X-Men 3' - Kelly's Deathstryke and Famke's Jean Grey both die (and this not being 'Star Trek' it's unlikely they'll come back to life), and while Storm is still around Halle Berry's turned down the opportunity to play her again. (Since Berry's performance is an improvement on last time, this is to be regretted. Then again, since Storm is more of a waste of space than Jean, maybe notÂ)END OF SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.The movie leaves some bits open, but doesn't feel like a cheat and certainly not like a setup for the third movie Â just like part of an ongoing story.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","doug_funnie","7 May 2003","What an amazing movie that is a perfect adaptation to the X-Men comics and cartoon. First I have to say that if you see this movie before the first one, you'll be confused and won't really understand why things happen the way they do. X2 isn't really a movie on its own, you need to have seen the first one. But everything about this movie, is so much bigger and better than the first, all of which equals to an enjoyable movie to watch many times. One of the best things about it, is that Rogue and Iceman have a much, much stronger role. As well as Pyro, making things interesting for an X3 (not to mention the hint of Phoenix in Jean). The characters are all amazing to watch on screen, all the main mutants are great on screen as they work together, and the effect of their powers make it better. Even the filming locations (Canada) look amazing on screen. The one negative comment I have, is that a few of the stunts and effects seemed a little un-realistic such as the X-Wing, but it's a small price to pay for such a good movie. Definitely a movie to watch if you're a fan and even if you're not, you'll still like it.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","phubbs","24 May 2014","So Toad and Sabretooth are dead and buried then it seems, guess they weren't that popular huh. Not surprising seeing as they were the worse characters from the last film. So after the unexpected smash of the original film we got this sequel adding more characters, more effects and a bit more much needed action.Moving on from the first film we discover now that Magneto has been tortured into giving up vital information about Xavier's school for mutants by the nasty new bad guy William Stryker. Stryker and his team capture Xavier and plan to create another Cerebro so they can brainwash Xavier into wiping out all the mutants of the world with his mental powers. Now is the time...the X-Men and Magneto's naughty mutants must join forces to save all mutant kind.Everything kicks off nicely with the cool introduction of new character Nightcrawler, who is performed with a likable heartfelt sincere persona by Alan Cumming. Its a good start to the film because not only do we get a slick sexy 'Matrix' style ass-kicking sequence courtesy of the Crawler, but this guy looks good, he's accurate to the source material and simply feels very fresh and original especially with that German accent. The one thing I don't get about this guy is the fact he can only teleport when he can see where's he's teleporting too. Surely when you teleport to anywhere you can't see where your going right? so what difference does it make?This film clearly tries for the 'Empire' tone by making everything quite dark with lots of pending doom and gloom. As we all know the film also ends on a downer with major character Jean Grey kicking the bucket, new boy Pyro switching to the dark side and Wolverine discovering some of his bleak past plus having to fight another similar mutant. In general the whole team are feeling like crap come the end of the day plus they no longer appear to be safe in their 'Wayne Manor-esque' home.But not only this we also get a much more violent film than the safe fast cut first flick. When Styker's men storm Xavier's mutant school armed to the teeth with automatic weapons we see Wolverine tear into some real hack n slash action as he rampages through the building slicing n dicing soldiers left right and centre (finally!). We also see a hint of mutant power from some younger students at the same time. Of course there is no blood or guts anywhere in the film but we do see Wolverine piling into bad guys impaling them pretty good with no cuts. This sequence to me shows another possible Nazi angle again as a community of 'different' people are invaded, rounded up and taken away from their home by armed soldiers, not even women and children are left.I liked how the story develops Pyro Iceman and Rogue together as they come to terms with their powers plus adolescence. The scene where Iceman outs himself to his parents is a cute scene with very real message which some folk will relate to. Some nice little touches of humour admittedly but its all very tame and easy going. The fact Iceman is obviously the good guy and Pyro is obviously the quick tempered bad guy feels a bit too simple, amazed one isn't wearing blue and the other red whilst fighting over Rogue. I didn't really like the inclusion of Lady Deathstrike though, she felt unnecessary and merely there just for a showdown with Wolverine at the end...which she ultimately was as she did nothing else the entire time. She's in and out quick, a sidekick that's killed off neatly, only there for the visuals and adding to the character roster. The fight was also completely lacking in any excitement because we know neither of these characters can be hurt, this being a problem with these films at times, invincible people fighting each other.Although I must admit I liked the concept of Stryker using his mutant son to control other mutants with a serum from his brain and the fact he induces Xavier into almost killing off everyone. OK sure the fact they managed to built another Cerebro seemed far fetched as I thought that was a special contraption that only Xavier and Magneto could devise but none the less it worked.I don't deny the film is dark but maybe it tries a little too hard? I'm not trying to nit pick but it does feel a bit forced especially when Grey didn't really have to die as far as I can tell. The jet wouldn't start due to a malfunction, so Grey goes outside and protects the jet from the tidal wave of water whilst using her powers to start up the jet. Why didn't she just start the jet up from inside or am I missing something here? I think I am missing something aren't I...??? Anyway it kinda felt odd that she dies in this way as if to try and create this iconic emotional death which I didn't really feel, it just seemed like a daft waste (and to kick start the Phoenix plot).Everything does feel a bit clockwork to be honest, there aren't any major surprises really (you can see things a mile off) but none the less it does hold your attention to the end. The visuals are on the whole much smoother and glossier than the first film, the actors are really getting into their respective roles, multiple characters are handled well by Singer and the film is also a highly positive encouraging shout out for gay people, teens, underachievers, outcasts, bullied people and any minorities on the whole. Although I still don't get how that highly advanced metal detector that scanned everything on and in the human body didn't pick up all that iron in the guards bloodstream, oh well.7/10",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","vip_ebriega","18 July 2008","My Take: Better than the original and the best in the series. Bryan Singer's big-budget sequel X2 (X-MEN UNITED) learns from the past to create a better, more streamlined comic book adventure that has a sharper script with just the same wallops of action and special effects. I enjoyed the original X-MEN film, but not for most parts as I should. While it had no further problem with visuals and action, the film is fatally flawed by weak writing. X2 is much better, continuing the legacy started by the first, and offering much more to it as well. The characters, not just Rouge (Anna Paquin), the evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), are taken into much deeper characteristics. The love-triangle subplot between Wolverine, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Cyclops (James Marsden), which were given much irregular treatment in the original, is given much better treatment here. The characters have so much more to do, and the plot is more complex, even if it isn't even borderline clever.During the great opening sequences (after an elaborate narration about mutants), a mutant poses an attack on the President of the United States, nearly killing him. The ever-benevolent X-men of Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) Mutant Academy believes Magneto could be behind it, but Xavier believes otherwise. Meanwhile, an obsessed scientist (Brian Cox) sees a chance to finally start a war against the mutant race, once he frames them as a threat to mankind. The X-men now must aid help from their own adversary Magneto (McKellen) and his sultry shape-shifting accomplice Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) to prevent a war that could destroy the world... and either race. The mutant gang also get a little help from a new batch of ""gifted"" beings including a self-transporting ""Incredible Nightcrawler"" (Alan Cumming), freeze-powered Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and fire-powered Pyro (Aaron Stanford).X2 is not free from its flaws, and while I never really gotten myself in the X-MEN fad, X2 is an agreeably enough thrill-machine on its own. Leave your brain to dry and let the pure 'X' quality flow right through you.Rating: **** out of 5.The DVD: A real treat on the big-screen, X2 will be much of the same delight on DVD. I suggest you get a hold of the 2-disc widescreen edition which features the film in a 2:40:1 Anamorphic widescreen format. The picture is not only clean, it rivals (if not outdoes) the quality featured on the big-screen. The sound is presented in a crisp Dolby Digital sound that's bound to blow you away, and don't you think it's safe to turn it down a little. If you're interested in the film's backstage drama, the DVD has a basket-load of special features, including an Audio-commentary with the director (Singer), cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, and another with the writers and producers. Disc 2 offers more, including a a making-of documentary called ""The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men"", as well as a series of informative featurettes and Multi-angle screen study of the famous Nightcrawler Attack prologue. Included as well, is an in-depth look on fight scene rehearsals. Finally, there's 11 deleted scenes and theatrical trailers. With English, Spanish and French subtitles/spoken languages.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","fciocca","12 April 2022","I think that X-Men 2 is quite an improvement over the first film. Bryan Singer managed to make a balanced movie that has the right amount of action, beautiful dialogues, meaningful messages, interesting and believable character development, while keeping the perfect runtime. The plot is more captivating, the acting is better: Anna Paquin, despite having little screen time, nailed her role. Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman here were astonishing. I have appreciated that the director took the time to deepen the tragic past of Wolverine. As always Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were the strongest elements of the cast. I honestly would not change a thing about this cine-comic. It is one of the few films of this kind that genuinely entertained me from start to finish. I personally suggest it to people that are not into this genre because it works well even as a standalone movie. No need to watch previous chapters in order to understand something. It is clear and straightforward.CGI, despite being a bit dated, definitely looks better than some prequel movies such as ""Apocalypse"". I wonder how the VFX department made effects that still hold pretty strongly after almost 20 years, while with the modern technologies they are not even able to do something that is somewhat decent. Maybe if Hollywood would not push so much to release productions in short spans of time, we would have better and more coherent films. For me ""X2"" is one of the highest peaks of this franchise.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","gbheron","8 July 2003","Years ago, when I first heard that X-Men was being brought to the screen I cringed. How could they translate the numbers and complexity of characters within a movie's short time span? Well, Mr. Singer did a good job of it, but had to spend much valuable screen time establishing his characters and their universe. Not so in the sequel, and the previous work pays dividends, allowing him to better develop the plot  and probe deeper into the character's personalities. Also, and this may be a result of having so many subjects to work with, Mr. Singer is not afraid to kill off his main characters, from any of the three conflicting camps. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies. The result is that X2 surpasses the original across the board.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","jon.h.ochiai","16 May 2003","Director Bryan Singer's ""X2: X-Men United"" has evolved past a great comic book movie into a great movie. Singer along with David Hayter have stayed true to the spirit of the comic book story lines (of which I was a fan years ago..), and at the same time told a tale of humanity, tolerance, and heroes. Singer has the benefit of ""X-Men"" under his belt which was itself a good movie, though very expository by nature of being the first movie. In X2 Singer amps up the action and the characters, focusing on Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Framke Janssen).Logan/ Wolverine starts unraveling his forgotten past with the introduction of human villain, William Stryker (Brian Cox), a paramilitary scientist with his own personal agenda of destroying all Mutants. Stryker has a grand plan. Jean Grey starts showing symptoms of awesome and yet uncontrollable power both as a telekinetic and a telepathic-- rivaling the prowess of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Like the comic this is an excellent foreshadowing of things to come-- in the next sequel. Jean also has romantic feelings for bad boy Logan (Jackman), though she is with Scott Sommers (James Marsden).Along the way, X2 creates great drama. Returning as Magneto is a very effective and strong Ian McKellan. Magneto and Charles Xavier (Stewart) form an unholy alliance against Stryker. This is a great touch. Magneto and Xavier possess the same goals, though opposed by ideology, sort of like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. This is a presumptuous analogy, and much like the comic book it is ambitious. And it is better to have something smart to say, rather than having nothing to say at all. Singer uses some of X2 (not all of it) to comment on the insanity of hatred against groups of people solely on the basis of being born a certain way. The true heroes of the world do their best to alter the listening of this kind of discrimination-- be it X-Men or humans-- into what is possible.Hugh Jackman really powers X2. He is a movie star. He has amazing charisma. As my friend, Jennifer, reminded me throughout the movie: ""He's hot!"" He is a also a very good and versatile actor. Whether he is bravely defending the children at the Xavier School from Stryker's troops or confronting Styker in the icy forest, he is powerful. Famke Janssen is up the challenge of the evolving Jean Grey. She is beautiful, smart, and conveys a sense of honor and sadness. Brian Cox as Stryker is essential, because he is a threatening presence throughout which is key to the drama unfolding. There is a quiet and justified evil that Cox brings to the character. X2 also has Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as beautiful and absolutely deadly villains.Bryan Singer and company have made a great movie--characters, action, and drama. Hopefully, Jackman and Singer will be back for X3.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","DarthBill","22 April 2004","Picking up where the first one left off, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) returns to the mansion after his search for answers into his past have proven fruitless and just as he shows up, everyone's running off in different directions following a mutant assassination attempt of the president. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) goes to the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan) for answers and gets gassed and captured along with Cyclops (James Marsden). Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) track down the would be mutant assassin, who turns out to be Night Crawler (Alan Cumming), who claims that he has no memory of what he was doing there or why. While watching the mansion, Wolverine and the students (Yes, the school actually does have students) are attacked by a bunch of commandos working for a mysterious mutant hater named William Stryker (Brian Cox). Some of the students escape - thanks to man of steel Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) - and some of them are captured, Wolverine kills some of them and escapes with a still wimpy Rogue (a still miscast Anna Paquin), her in movie only boyfriend Bobby Drake/Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore), and John/Pyro to be (Aaron Stanford, replacing whoever that was who was playing him in the first movie) to Bob's house, where his family finally learns he's a mutant and his little brother rats them out to the cops. Well, Magento escapes thanks to Mystique (Rebecca R-Stamos) and a reluctant alliance is formed between the X-Men and Magento to rescue Professor X from Styker, who's trying to use him to kill all the mutants on Earth and is then switched by Magneto to kill all the humans.
Faster, more action, more special effects, and more humor, this is all in all an improvement over the first. However, the climax in which Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself by using her telekinetic powers to hold back the water spilling out of the dam so as not to bury the X-jet and is herself engulfed by the waters and apparently destroyed, simply doesn't ring true. I mean, Storm and Ice Man were RIGHT THERE, why didn't they just get out and freeze the damn water? Oh right, because that would make sense, would be too easy and the writers were too lazy to think of a more convincing way for Jean to bite the dust. Of course, we all know that Jean will be back in an adaptation of the Phoenix saga...I would have liked to have seen less Night Crawler (despite Alan Cumming's snappy performance) and more Colossus, and there is still too much focus on Wolverine, but all in all, it's not a bad film. Watered down maybe, but not bad.Trivia note: in the comic books, Mystique is Night-Crawler's mother, but this is not mentioned in the film.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","wetmars","16 February 2020","Right from the exact start, the movie was absolutely epic! Even though the theme was only featured was only featured briefly at the start, it was enough to make you want to get up and join the mutant fight! Man, I feel like that. (( xd )) As it played while the credits were rolling, I feel nothing else to do besides swing around my imaginary Wolverine claws. Not only did it sound absolutely epic, but it made you feel awesome.And I loved Wolverine's rampage during the Mansion Raid. Running? Check! Screaming? Check! Slashing wildly? Check!

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","robert-300","30 April 2003","* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*What is it this year.No sooner has one sequel(Shanghai Knights) been and gone that was better than it's predecessor than we get another one.This time the movie happens to be the long awaited X-men 2,or X-2 as the film makers apear to have dubbed it.Having not liked the first movie which I fealt was a huge let down I was most pleasently surprised after watching this.Starting off where the first movie finished X-2 opens on an attack on the American president in the White house by an unknown assassin.The Presidents bodyguards attempt to defend the countries leader to the best of their ability but the assassin is no mere man.He is quite obviously a mutant and one who's appearance is more inhuman than most. The creature, a German named Kurt Wagner(Played by Scots actor Alan Comming)uses his incredible powers of speed, agility and teleportation to despatch the presidents guards and break in to the oval office where he pins the terrified world leader to a desk while brandishing a massive dagger.It seem a fore gone conclusion that Wagner is about to stab the President with the weapon when he is shot and wounded by one of the world leaders men who happend to still be conscious.Wagner teleports away,leaving behind the dagger embedded within the President's desk and a label upon it with the words 'Mutant Freedom emblazened upon it.This is more than enough to put the chills up the President and more than needed for the worlds media to seize upon as mutant hating propoganda.Meanwhile Logan(The amazing Hugh Jackman)or Wolverine as he is also known as,returns to the mutant training school owned by his friend Prof.Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart).Logan's search for the scientific millitary installation where he lost his memory has been less than fruitful.Reunited with Rogue(Anna Paquin)the teenage girl he helped in the first movie who has the power to sap the energy from any living being.Logan finds that she is now dating another mutant.A teenage boy called Bobby Drake who has the power to freeze virtually any object.Another teenager at the school is John Allerdyce who has the power of combustion.He can start fires with his mind.This young lad though has a more rebellious nature than his two friends,Rogue and Bobby and through out the movie we see this nature at it's very worse which will lead to a scary move on the part of the young man.Prof. Xavier meanwhile on learning of what transpired at the white house instructs two of his former pupils, Storm and Jean Grey(The beautiful actresses Halle Berry and Famke Janssen)to try and find the mutant who attacked the President and hope to discover and understand why he did what he did.As Storm and Jean make their way to find Nightcrawler, former soldier and scientist for the US army, Col.William Stryker(Brian Cox) is attepting to set a diabolical plot he has in motion.A hater of mutants, Stryker uses the powers invested upon him by the President to find out where the mutant training school is.The source of this information is none other than the meniachal Erik Lehnsherr(Ian McKellen), better known as the master of magnetism, Magneto.Stryker gained the information from a device he planted on Magneto's neck.It was this device that made the human despising mutant spill his guts to the colonel.With his mentally controlled mutant henchwoman Lady Deathstrike(Kelly Hu) in tow, Stryker begins to put his plans in to operation.The invasion of the mutant school and the erradication of every single mutant on the face of the planet.But unknown to Stryker.one of Magneto's lackey's, the cunning shapeshifter Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) is out there planning to free her master.It's this act that will lead the pair of human hating mutants in to an uneasy alliance with the X-men.This is an Excellent movie.Better than than the first movie deserved.Almost every one of the cast gives grade-A performaces.Once again Hugh Jackman is magnificent as possibly the best character in the movie.Who can't help but love that rugged smart ass that Wolverine is.Who can also forget the likes of brits Patrick Stewart,Ian Mckellen,Brian Cox and Alan Comming who are all first rate(Even though Cox's southern accent is a bit on the dodgy side).Kudos must go to James Marsden who thus far has not recieved mentioned as the X-mens team leader Scott Summers aka.Cyclops.His performance as the more buttoned down mutant to Wolverines rugged charmer deseves equal praise.Famke Janssen is also amazing.Not only is she an incredibly attractive woman but a talented actress as well.She brings just the right of courage to Jean Grey while managing to be convincingly scared of a fate that she knows is coming.Halle Berry however isn't so great.Her performance isn't terrible.It's actually quite good but she will never be anything more to me than an attractive woman with just a glimmer of acting ability. Credit however must go to the kids who all give great performances.Paquin,Stanford and Ashmore could possibly be three of the worlds biggest up and coming movie stars.As for Bryan Singers direction.It is as good as ever.He show's his versatility on this one once again.All you need do is compare this movie to the likes of his first major success, The Usual Suspects to see his flair as a maker of movies.The script too is brilliantly written.The characters are all richly textured.Being truely believable in a world of true fantasy.It's a testament to the writing talents of those involved.The pace is nicely kept and even holds your interest in the dialogue scenes which at times are quite funny.As for the special effects and the make up.They'll just blow you away.There is the odd little quibble.The final showdown between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike,although beautifully choreographed could have been a bit longer.The end could also have came a bit sooner as well.That said however, X-2 is first rate cinema entertainment at it's very best.When you get the chance I suggest you rush out and see it as soon as you can.Because blockbusters that are this good don't come around all that often and trust me, I know.I've seen enough of them to attest to it.Robs Rating:* * * * *",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","jace_the_film_guy","31 August 2022","X2 has moments of greatness, but it never felt like the stakes were raised. The film was continually hashing out the same problems as the first X-Men without much progression. A lack of direction and too many hands in the writing room kept me from being fully invested.That being said, the action was great (especially Wolverine), the team-up was legendary (who is the real bad guy) and Magneto's cage (the blood!) was easily the best scene of the film. X2 isn't bad but it isn't great, it's simply a mid-tier comic book movie. Compared to the rest of the X-Men Universe, this is higher up on the ranking but not when looking at modern cinema.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","stamper","26 May 2003","X2 (what people invent such a clever title?) was released here in the Netherlands on May the 1st, but I had to wait until today (May 25th) before I could finally watch it, because as a poor student I was a little short of cash (plus I'd planned to waste my last few bucks on seeing The Matrix Reloaded on the REALLY big screen and watch X2 in the village cinema which gets movies a few weeks weeks to three months later than any other cinema). Anyway I was pretty excited to see it and when it came to my notice that the film would be playing th the village cinema on the 25 of May (a mere 3 weeks after it's release) I immediately reserved me some tickets. A few hours before going to the theater though I came to realize that I hadn't seen a preview of X2 yet. No trailer, no teaser, nothing (or had I simply forgot about it due to the Matrix hype?). The only thing I new was that the mutants had to stand united for something. Now why was I going to watch a film, if I didn't know what it was about? Well I was going, because I had seen the first X - Men film, which in my mind (I don't know if that is a good method to measure by) was awesome. To make it even more plain and simple: I was going because this film roughly had the same cast and crew as the first X - Men film and because I trusted them to make a good sequel. I didn't need noisy trailers or samples of the special effects and action scenes that were to be seen in the film. Being responsible for making X - Men (with Spider-Man THE BEST Marvel comic adaption until now) is all the credit you need to get me to the big screen.
X2 kicks off with a very nice fighting, scene which certainly owed some of it's visual finesse to Andy and Larry (you know who you are and so do most movie buffs). After that shine and turbulent intro the film continues where X - Men had ended, namely with Wolverine's quest to find out what exactly had happened to him. From that point on, these two events become entangled into each other and a story unfolds which builds on quite well on the previous film, without neglecting new elements. The new elements in the story are mainly new characters or characters that get a bit more attention than in X - Men (Pyro, Nightcrawler, Colossus) who were all portrayed in an acceptable manner by the actors. The only exception to that was Nightcrawler, who was portrayed excellently by Alan Cumming. He was very believable and rather sweet as the faithful and shy mutant from Germany and he even managed to nail the parts in the film in which he spoke German (correct German without too much of an accent and none of that: 'Schiess den Glas' crap they pulled in Die Hard). The rest of the film pretty much built forth on the things that were established in the first film (so if you haven't seen it I can advise you too, it will make some things much clearer). The film does so in an excellent manner and I've really got no complaints to the film overall. The action and the story were good, there were some emotional elements and one or two laughs as well, without any big misstep's. But comparing the film to it's predecessor (something which one always does) I must say that the film could have been a bit more dramatic. Not just to add drama, but to give the film more depth. Yes that is the word. The film could have had a bit more depth. It could for instance have explored the relationship between Jason and Charles Xavier a bit more or there could have been a bit more focus on what Stryker had done to Jason, so we (the viewers) could have felt a bit more for that pitiful 'creature'. Now mind you that these are all minor pointers to the makers and it does not mean that the film was not good. It just means that it wasn't as good as the first one, it wasn't perfect. But is still was a very good sequel. I (yes I too answer the question that has held a lot of movie freaks in their grip for quite some time this year) even thought it was better than The Matrix Reloaded. But that does not mean much, simply because The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions are to be combined into a 5 hour long film and I've only seen half of it. I am as it were currently in the lobby of the cinema drinking and eating some refreshments, waiting for the break to finish.
Singer, cast and crew have once again managed to make a good film and I am truly grateful for it. I sure as hell hope that they'll make a third film in the series and I hope that next time they'll inject a bit more of that Marvel-dilemma into the story. But this time I cannot be quite so sure of a sequel. None of the actors had signed a contract for more than two films and to be honest I think that there could be some problems with getting the entire cast to return. Academy Award winner Halle Berry might be the biggest trouble, but I certainly hope there won't be a problem a bigger paycheck can't solve. I don't care how much money the actors ask, give it to them they've earned it (on performance AND profit).
If the X - Men return, so shall I.

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","djcallender","13 May 2003","I can appreciate comic books as much as the next guy (although I'm not a reader), and the X-Men, I have to admit, are probably the best team out there, if not the best superheroes, period. That said, the movie versions do not live up to mutant standards. Its okay, we can be honest, no one will hurt us here.I think the only thing making these flicks so popular is the fact that comic book fans get to actually see live action interpretations of what they had only previously been able to catch in 2-D rendering--and not the quality of the films themselves. Why the special treatment?I think all comic-to-screen attempts are hindered in one way--the filmmakers concentrate too much on the visuals and lose sight of the characters and the story. Those latter two qualities suffer as a result. There have been many movies that have done a good job of alleviating this obstracle (Superman and Spiderman, even Batman and Daredevil), but X-Men and X2 fail miserably. With as much criticism that the Star Wars prequels receive regarding their scripts and dialogue, you'd think more people would let the X-movies have it.Furthermore,  do they really do anything visually innovative? I like alot of what I saw in X2, but overall it was nothing on par with, say, The Matrix. I'm not asking for a Matrix ripoff by any means. What I am saying is that I would have liked to see the same level of quailty and commitment. Maybe it was just that the F/X were not effective because of the weak plot and character development; they were sort of wasted. Either way, they don't save the  film.Its not just me, the casual fan, that dislikes these films. I recently had an eye-opening discussion with my friend, the die-hard comic book geek. He confessed that he felt compelled to be a big X-Men movies fan because of its comic book roots. In actuality, however, he hated much of what they did to his beloved mutants, and was quite dissapointed in general.
So let all of us X-Men fans stand up, and speak our true feelings--the movies are not that good! There--no longer should we hide in disgrace. We are free, free at last!",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","tbills2","28 December 2012","X2 is a great action/adventure filled with interesting characters, good writing, a good story, and awesome visuals. The special effects and the action scenes are striking, and they can take you by storm, and they're kind of beast. The story in support is X-cellent. It has great pace, good dialogue. X-Men 2 is one of the very best comic book films, topping the first of the series making it one of cinema's great sequels.The cast is very good top to bottom, lead by the performances of Ian McKellan and Brian Cox. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, very solid. The characters shine and are the focal point throughout. The story isn't exactly complete but it is very good and it does a terrific job of holding the film together. The writing as well as the directing by Bryan Singer is very good. It's too bad for X-Men fans that Singer chose to abandon the franchise and go do Superman. X-Men 3 suffers for it. The action sequences of X2 unfold nicely and are very fun for the viewer to see with some great mutant battles. Though the film lacks great scope and can be somewhat one dimensional, it should be appreciated for its gorgeous visuals and awesome action. This is a movie that I really love, upping it from an 8, giving it a 9 out of 10. I'm a big fan of the X-Men and I look forward to hopefully many X-Men movies in future years.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","juliankennedy23","13 May 2005","X2: 6/10: X2 solves the biggest problem I had with the original X-men movie. I am no longer rooting for the wrong side. You see in the first film I quickly found myself agreeing with the bad guys led by Ian McKellen rather than the good guys led by Captain Picard himself Patrick Stewart. I simply felt the so-called bad guys were right and on top of that simply had a better plan. Since McKellen and Stewart are working together in this film (however temporarily) that point is mooted. The other improvement over the last film is more coherent and effective action sequences. Part of this is due to a bigger budget and better F/X technology, but director Bryan Singer also seems to have a better grip on the pacing and shooting of both the action sequences in particular and the entire film. A better grip on the characters on the other hand still seems the series weak point. Part of this is my fault.I am simply not familiar enough with the X-men universe and their powers. For example we have Stewart's character able to kill everyone on earth with his thoughts but unable to escape the mental influence of a little girl. The rest of the powers are often as sloppy. One great example is the groaner when Magneto draws the iron from blood to make bullets. Even the characters get confused as nobody remembers that there is an Iceman on the plane when the killer tidal wave approaches.Also, as in the first film, a chunk of time is spent on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character. He is cool and all but I still am not sure why he is considered a mutant? (If he has a metal skeleton surrounded by flesh and was built by humans I thinking cyborg) Throw in another dozen or so good and bad guys to keep track of and the confusion seems clear. As a result there is no real emotional attachment and a lot of confusion regarding the characters. Add on a clumsy coming out to your parents parable and a generally PC vibe of the good guys and I can't recommend the film. Also where exactly in McKellen's clear jail cell suspended from the ceiling is the bathroom?",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","Animany94","12 June 2019","I recently watched the first X-Men movie and enjoyed it a lot, but I had never expected this sequel to be as good as it was.Everything had been turned up to eleven, the story, the performances, the tension between humas and mutants. It just worked perfectly.The X-Men are forced to join forces with their enemy Magneto to battle a tremendous threat to them all when William Stryker and his son kidnaps Charles Xavier to fulfill his diabolical scheme against all mutants in the entire world. During the chase we learn more about the origin of Wolverine without solving it completely, leaving room for future installments which is also quite obvious with the ending.Some of these settings are actually very eerie and atmospheric helped on by the power of most performances. One in particular is Christopher Lee as the imprisoned Magneto after his capture in the first movie, he just gave me the chills. Another highlight is Brian Cox and Michael Reid MacKay as William Stryker and his son Jason respectively. Stryker is just diabolical and Jason, even though he never utters a word, is powerful in his own right.Many good action scenes and effective moments of suspense, because you don't want it to end in tragedy for anyone. Not predictable like many superhero movies can be, but neither disorganized or messy. Just an enjoyable treat and a rare example of a sequel improving upon its predecessor.",NA

"Mr. Bean's Holiday","gregsrants","5 November 2003","There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2. The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyone's favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villains are back for an encore also as Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) returns as the metal manipulator Magneto, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Introduced in X2 are Pryo, Deathstrike and Alan Cummings who steals the show as the blue faced teleporter named Nightcralwer. With a cast of characters as strong and diluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves with the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, a satisfying dose of that character will be administered. The story in X2 is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil Mr. Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to for the safety of humans.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor has been forced to locate and destroy all mutants through his unique ability to telepathically connect with those of unordinary powers. There are many subplots in X2:  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and requires anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, with top rate special effects and a body count (missing from the first movie) piling up fast. Wolverine again commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the mutant school and later with Deathstrike, is better than anything filmed in this year's earlier release Daredevil. X-Men comic book readers will have an advantage over the average movie screener.  I sat next to such a character that grinned with unprecedented glee with glimpses of Colosses and Kitty Pryde and the screen time given to the Blackbird jet, however, do not be dismayed, the movie is interesting and strong enough that a history of the characters and their origins before screening is not necessary. For the most part, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him. He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for the third installment.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  Both stories require a third segment to explain in whole. In today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters joining forces whenever evil threatens all.  Now, don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like X-Men 2 even more enjoyable.In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third",NA

The premise of the film sees an army colonel attack the X-Mansion which forces The X-Men to team up with Magneto & Mystique to take him down.Main Character
Hugh Jackman is back in his second time in the role and he maybe even better here then he was in the first film. He still has the charm and charisma, but in this film we see a more feral Wolverine and this is the first time we really get to see him in brutal and heavy action scenes. Also his character has a more personal arc here, his connection to the villain is well established and adds to the intrigue of the character of Wolverine.Supporting Characters
Sir Ian Mckellen is back as Magneto and he is superb here, he is brilliant in the role and seeing his dynamic with the rest of the cast is a highlight of the film. For such a legendary actor seeing him revelling in this role is truly fantastic and he is just an absolute treat to see here. Sir Patrick Stewart is also back as Charles Xavier and he is also great, his character is in the background a bit more here but he still gives a powerful performance and it works here. I gave Halle Berry some criticism as Storm in the first film, but she is so much better here and her character is really well done and she is given a chance to show more of her powers off which is great. Alan Cumming comes in as the mysterious Nightcrawler and he is the showstealer here, he delivers possibly the greatest opening scene in comic book history and has a really interesting character here. Famke Jenssen as Jean Grey is even better here then she was in the first film and Rebecca Romijn is even better as Mystique and along with Nightcrawler is a real standout here. Also Brian Cox is great as William Stryker and is a worthy antagonist here
Story
The story is really interesting, focusing on Wolverines past and a different human angle is great and provides a different experience from the first film. The individual team members get good character arcs and seeing Magneto and The X-Men team up is great to see. My few issues with the story is that Xavier & Cyclops really get pushed into the background here which is a disappointment, also the first act of the film is a bit choppy. It introduces so much that it is a little unfocused which means some characters have much more screen time then others.Script
The script here is great, similar to the first film there is a real great blend of humour and drama. The drama I felt was increased here and made this a much heavier movie then the first which really helped make this film better the n the first.Style
The film looks fantastic, the action scenes are so well done. It feels more intense and more action packed then the first film, there is a siege of The X-Mansion which is amazing and a fight scene between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike that is better then any action scene in the previous film.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic sequel, that pretty much improves on everything from the previous film. It is a truly great comic book movie and for me is one you must watch, after you have watched the first film.Rating - 9/10.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","lark40","30 December 2021","I think Stephen sommers has created a unique characters and a better film. So with all the hatred and mistrust brewing between humans and mutuans with an unprovoked attack on the US president gives general styrker his long awaited chance to wage all out war a war that would leave only one race victorious.Xavier, wolverine, storm and the other xmen unite with their old adversary magneto to prevent a devastating battle which would destroy everyone on earth. This film delivers state of the art special effects with one twist after another with Jean grey becoming her all powerful mutant enjoy.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","russem31","6 December 2005","This was a better sequel than the first film (which was also quite good) and kudos goes to director Bryan Singer for doing so. Again, the actors pulled in the right punches, with Patrick Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine) again in the spotlight. Not only that, the story is stronger than the first film and John Ottman gives the film a strong score than the late Michael Kamen (an equally adept composer for most other films = just look at his Die Hard scores but unfortunately not the first X-Men score). Not only that, the production design, cinematography, and visual effects are all top-notch and not over-the-top, servicing the story (NOT being the story). This film is a must see, a strong 8 out of 10.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","FilmOtaku","5 June 2003","I walked into this movie really hopeful that my appreciation for the first X-Men film wasn't a fluke.  While I am a self-admitted comic book geek from way back, I tend to not like the films derived from comic book or graphic novel origins.  There are a few exceptions: Ghost World, the first two Batman films, and for camp value, the first two Superman films Â but the bad far outweigh the good.  Having this opinion, I didn't expect much of anything out of X-Men three years ago but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.  I am delighted to say that I did walk out pleasantly surprised again this time, but because I actually liked the sequel better than its predecessor.  In X2, we once again have the same characters we left off with from the first film along with a few interesting additions Â most notably Nightcrawler, who was brilliantly portrayed by Alan Cumming.  I can't imagine that projecting feeling from behind pounds of blue makeup and prosthetics can be easy, but he absolutely made it work.  X2 had more thrills and back story than the first film as well as more of a compelling story line.  Fortunately, it isn't completely necessary to have seen X-Men before viewing this film; however the exposition used to transfer viewers from the first to second film was subtle enough to clue in first time viewers without irritating fans who know the background.  Without providing spoilers, I will commend the film for taking chances and for providing hints for readers of the comic book of things to come.  --Shelly",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","movies2u","17 June 2003","X2 was a very action packed movie. Each scene was loaded with action seriously. The story wasn't as great as the original, but it worked along with the movie. The acting was great with performances from Famke Janssen and others. This movie is recommended to action/scifi lovers! I give X2 a 7/10",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holiday","chera_khalid","29 September 2023","X2, oh boy, what a mutant rollercoaster! The actors really brought their A-game, giving life to the characters with a charisma that hooked me from the get-go. The film editing was like a mutant power in itself, seamlessly weaving together action sequences and emotional moments. The strength of X2 lies in its ability to balance the explosive mutant powers with the vulnerability of its characters, making them relatable despite their extraordinary abilities. The music was a mutant anthem, perfectly syncing with the pulse-pounding scenes. While it soared in many aspects, there were a few hiccups in pacing that kept it from reaching mutant perfection. Yet, the cinematography painted a visually stunning world of mutants, leaving me on the edge of my seat. X2 may not be flawless, but at 7/10, it's a mutant masterpiece that embraces the beauty within its quirks.",NA
