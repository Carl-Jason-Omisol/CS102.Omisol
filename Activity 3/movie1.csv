"BA_Harrison","18 September 2016","Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.Using his confined location-a packed intercity train-to maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.","

"3xHCCH","5 September 2016","This new Korean film ""Train to Busan"" is certainly earning a lot of positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.The central character is Seok-woo, a man stressed out with problems about his investments business and his divorce. His 9-year old daughter Su-an, feeling neglected, requests her father to bring her to Busan the next day to see her estranged mother. Seok-woo could not say no.On the same train to Busan as Seok-woo and Su-an, a lady passenger with a bite wound on her legs, collapses and turns into a zombie. As she bites another person, that next person would also turn into a zombie and so on. Panic ensues on the train, and as everyone eventually discover along the way that the same zombie frenzy was true for the rest of the country. The fight to survive is now on.This film was one exhilarating roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. The zombies and their attack scenes were very well-executed with a combination of practical and computer-generated effects. These monsters were very fast-moving and relentless in their quest for human flesh. We hear people around us gasp and shriek with shock as we see these zombies pile up in droves and hordes, crash out of windows and barrel through doors. We breathlessly hang on to the edge of our seats the whole ride.Of course, what Korean film does not have a good dose of melodrama? The father-daughter dynamic between Seok-woo and Su-an is front and center. But aside from them, we also meet a cast of supporting characters on the train whose fates we will be following for the rest of the film. These include a burly man with his pregnant wife, a teenager with his girlfriend and his baseball team, a haughty businessman, two elderly sisters and a homeless man, among others. We get just enough introduction about who they are for us to care about what happens to them.Gong Woo played the flawed lead character Seok-woo very well. He was able to convincingly portray the development of this uncaring apathetic guy into a hero we could all root for to get through this crisis alive. He was as good in the weepy dramatic scenes as he was in the swashbuckling action scenes. This actor has come a long way since his breakout role as lead star of the TV romantic comedy series ""The Coffee Prince"" back in 2007.Kim Su-an is only 10 years old but she had already been acting in films for five years now. She is the dramatic core of this film as the daughter desperately reaching out to her jaded father. As a child actress, she held her own impressively among this cast of veterans with her heartfelt portrayal. Who would have thought that the sad little song she wanted to sing for her father would resonate so much?Ma Dong-seok is charismatic as Sang-hwa, a devoted husband and selfless fighter. We see him first as some sort of comic relief only, which made the audience warm up to him. Later, we would discover how much more his character was able to do and give for others, and loved him more. His pregnant wife Seong-kyeong was played by acclaimed Korean indie film actress Jung Yu-mi, conveying strength in her delicate condition.Another actor of note is Kim Eui-sung, who was totally hateful in his role as the selfish Yong-suk. In total contrast to Sang-hwa, Yong- suk was a man only thought of himself alone, not caring that he actually put a lot of other characters directly into harm's way.Ahn So-hee (as Jin-hee) and Choi Woo-shik (as Young-guk) were in there to inject some teenage romantic angst into the film. They were relatively lightweight performers who were probably included just because they looked cool. That scene when Young-guk encounters his baseball teammates-turned-zombies was very well-conceived by the writers.People may dismiss as ""just"" being a zombie film, but it is the drama of human relationships and interactions that rises above the horrific and thrilling carnage. Director Yeon Sang-ho's first two feature- length films (""The King of Pigs"" and ""The Fake"") were both animated films exploring the bleak side of human nature. With his first live action directorial effort, Yeon has created a complete film masterpiece with ""Train to Busan."" Highly recommended! 10/10.","

"Troy_Campbell","12 August 2016","This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim – a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes – love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man – a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes ""infected"" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark.","

"claudio_carvalho","14 September 2016","The investment manager Seok Woo (Yoo Gong) is a divorced man that lives in Seoul, with his daughter a Soo-an (Soo-an Kim) and his mother. Seok Woo is a selfish man and neglects Soo-an that misses her mother that lives in Busan. On Soo-an's birthday, she asks to visit her mother and Seok Woo travels with her with the intention of returning after lunch. They board the fast train KTX and a sick woman also boards another wagon. During the journey, the woman attacks a train staff and soon all the passenger in the wagon are attacked turning into zombies. Soon Seok Woo realizes that there is a zombie outbreak in South Korea and together with the passenger Sang Hwa (Dong-seok Ma), who is traveling with his pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Yu-mi Jeong), they isolate the safe front wagons from the infected ones. Along their journey, the non-infected passengers have to fight the zombies and the selfishness of the human being. ""Busanhaeng"", a.k.a. ""Train to Busan"", is one of the best zombie films ever made. The story is original and there is deep character development, which is not usual in horror movies, showing the different behavior of the human being in a stressful situation depending on his or her character (or lack of). The direction is amazing and the action scenes are fantastic. The screenplay is melodramatic but also attractive; the beautiful cinematography and special effects and make-up are highlighted by perfect edition. The cast has good performance but the girl Soo-an Kim is impressive and steals the show. We hope Hollywood industry does not destroy this little gem with the usual remake. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available","

"ctowyi","4 August 2016","This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. Putting 80% of the action on a bullet train didn't constraint the wealth of inventive ideas one bit as the commuters escape the crazy zombies from car to car. The momentum is terrific and I kept marveling at all creative problem-solving; some I have never seen before. The character arc of the main actor from narcissistic anti-hero to titular hero is very potent and what injects the narrative with much forward power. Love the subtext of class and government hypocrisy, class division, vileness of human nature and the dreaded herd mentality. Ya ya ya, I know the movie never delves too deep into them. Because that would rob the movie of its relentless momentum. I think Paul Greengrass who made Jason Bourne needs to study the cinematography here. You don't need to do split-second cuts and shake the camera to make the audience feel in-the-moment. The action set-pieces are so well choreographed that I understand and see everything. Straits Times (my local papers) said the last act is disappointing with the train derailing, crashing into some cliché-obstacles and careening through melodramatic territory. Hello? This is Korean cinema - melodrama is expected and in this case welcomed with open arms. IMHO the first two acts are so explosively fun and rollicking thrilling that it practically earned its melodramatic ending. Heck! I was nearly tearing up. This is one of the most entertaining and unpretentious zombie movies I have seen in a while. This is one train you need to board.","

Another is me giving a film 10/10, it simply doesn't happen.Me and Korean cinema have always had a good relationship, I tend to enjoy their works and this right here is their coup de grace.Essentially a sequel to Seoul Station (2016) which was an acclaimed feature length zombie anime, Train To Busan tells the story of the passengers of a train from Seoul to Busan as the outbreak begins.Full of fantastic characters, great writing and several scenes that need to be seen to be believed Train To Busan shows how fresh the zombie sub genre can be in the right hands.The film looks incredible and flows perfectly all the way from the first victim to the incredible memorable finale.Train To Busan is nothing short of a masterpiece that I would recommend to everyone not just fans of the genre.I would love to see a sequel as this was near perfection.The Good:Brilliant characters/character developmentLooks outstandingHighly originalAction packedEmotionally charged and thought provokingThe Bad:Can't think of a thing","

"gregsrants","16 October 2016","No genre has suffered from volume overload as the zombie genre. Zombie television shows, zombie movies both theatrical and straight to video, city zombie walks.zombies are everywhere. Because of the glut of flesh eating walking dead, no genre has suffered so much with overkill. Zombies themselves are not particularly interesting beasts. They don't have any character. They just run (or slow walk) bite and run (or slow walk) again. You won't find many reviews on the thousands of zombie films that will go into detail about the complex layers of the zombie's inner mind.With what seems like an endless parade of zombie films each week being offered across various platforms it's a nice surprise when a film such as Train to Busan offers what feels like a fresh take on an exhausted premise.Train to Busan is a South Korean zombie film brought to us from writer/director Sang-ho Yeon. The idea is commonplace - a zombie apocalypse is underway - but the setting adds to the drama. The movie takes place almost exclusively on a train where the passengers are stuck in in a speeding bullet. And when an infected individual boards the train, the group's only safety will be in the various train cars free of the blood hungry hordes.The group of characters that face life and death to zombie situations are an eclectic band of heroes and villains including a father and daughter team, a pregnant woman and her husband, a young teenage baseball team and various train attendants. Their survival is hanging on the notion that if the train full of zombies can reach the Busan station where the military is lying in wait.Although there are plenty of been there/seen that moments in Train to Busan, the film still offers a fresh feel largely due to the claustrophobic setting. There are some fresh ideas - such as what happens to the zombies when the train enters into a tunnel - and these ideas coupled with zombies that run like Olympic qualifiers and above average special effects lead to a heart pounding rollicking good time.One could not fully review Train to Busan without discussing the ending. Starting with an unexpected train crash the final few reels are filled with one surprise after another. And the ending is almost heart-wrenching in its execution.Train to Busan is a thrill ride. A thrill ride that was a rousing crowd pleaser when it screened at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. But it is more than just a genre festival favorite. It is one of best zombie films every produced and might just be one of the best movies of any genre in 2016.","

"subxerogravity","31 July 2016","We're leaving (leaving) on that Zombie Train to Busan (leaving on the undead train).Use to seeing Korean horror films about ghost, but Zombies!? This was refreshing.So this neglectful dad tries to make amends with his daughter by riding with her on the train (which she wanted to go by herself) to take her back to his ex-wife. Lucky for both of them as a zombie outbreak happens while their on the train. Now, their only hope for survival is to make it to the Busan stop.You really can't go wrong with a Zombie movie. It's rare that I've have seen one that I did not like. Train to Busan is definitely a good one too. Its filled with interesting characters. Other than the father daughter team, the train is also occupied by a pregnant women and her Macho and humorous husband, a school girl and her baseball playing boyfriend and some homeless wonderer who saw the outbreak first hand, just to name a few. The social commentary speaks on what you are made of as an individual and as a society with the best and the worse coming out of everyone during this crisis.I loved how relentless and aggressive the Zombies were. More like 28 days later than Romero. The special effects do get a little cartoony with zombies that seem to come form nowhere piling over one another like poring cereal into a bowl or something, but it does give you that man, these guys are screwed feel. Train to Busan focus on the idea that the walking dead sense you through sight and sound. If they can not see you or hear you they have no way of knowing your living flesh is a foot away from their hunger. It made for some cleaver obstacles when a group of passengers have to maneuver through train cars filled with zombie passengers (Sounds like the next game in the Resident Evil franchise).Also found it interesting that no zombies were shot in this picture. I don't know how Korean gun control laws work, but I can assume it's strict enough that the story would make no sense if someone on the train just happen to have one for zombie killing (unlike an American movie in which the unborn child having a gun would be fine so long as it moved along the story). Definitely a rarity in a Zombie picture and it worked.It's Action packed, it's humorless, with incredible looking zombies and a cast of characters so lively you give a crap what happens to them in the end. http://cinemagardens.com/","

"davelowen","23 August 2016","The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!","

"falcondj","17 March 2020","This movie did what I have not seen many, if any, American or British-made zombie movies even try, and that's tell a believable, frightening, and tear-jerking story that will keep you interested all the way to the end. The only other zombie movie I enjoyed as much as this one is of a completely different genre, and that's Shaun of the Dead (a British comedy).This movie had characters you loved and hated. This movie had a situation that was believable under those circumstances. This movie had actually scary zombies and situations that did not rely on cheap jumpscares to frighten viewers. This movie also had emotion, enough to make a grown man need a box of tissues by the end, and no I'm not talking about for the hot cheerleader girl.Absolutely take a chance on this movie! The whole movie is Korean audio and English sub, which normally I don't enjoy, because I don't like to read my movies, but you will quickly forget you're reading subtitles after a short while because the story keeps you hooked.","

"tom_saint","22 August 2016","Hello,We can argue whether a zombies should be fast or not –In the movie, they are fast, deadly and merciless. It is more believable than those zombies can take over a city or a country within a day.The movie succeed where Fear The walking dead failed miserably, to explain how the pandemic starts and how it has been spread so fast.Most of the movie take place in a train, very claustrophobic place if you are chased by a herd of undead, but it worked for me, I felt the tension, the drama, the crazy survival instinct of ones and the resignation of the others.Walking dead made the zombie apocalypse almost cool, with guns and sex and love story, In train to busan nothing is cool, you do not have gun, your family and pretty much everyone you know are dead, there is no escape and nobody will come to save you ..I spent 2 marvelous hours watching a movie about zombies, I despite the fact I watched hundred movies about zombies, I have been surprised and scared.","

But it still manages to be very original. The morality tale is strong, and we see a transformation of corporate self centered father into a self sacrificing hero. The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending. Movie is fun, fresh and still manages to be a good zombie/outbreak movie showing end of the world of sorts, in a way much higher budget Hollywood crapies can only dream to achieve.

I don't remember having watched any movie that is so damn engaging, so easy to follow, and so exciting right from the first few minutes all the way to the end. All the exciting moments end with a climax that's fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for characters development. I don't understand why someone commented the last 30 minutes is not as good. I find each climax better in the next. If they make a sequel to show some happenings elsewhere with the same plot and concept, I will still watch it.","

"Leofwine_draca","1 March 2017","South Korea has made plenty of horror films over the last couple of decades, but very few of them have been zombie films; the country typically favours ghost or psycho tales like WHISPERING CORRIDORS or I SAW THE DEVIL. That changes with TRAIN TO BUSAN, a Hollywood-feel film that owes more than a debt of inspiration to WORLD WAR Z in its depiction of fast, feral zombies that amass into a CGI-animated crowd on occasion.This film is straightforward enough, with a simple premise: zombies on a train. And yet it also happens to be thoroughly gripping, exciting, and indeed excellent, thanks to the skill of director Yeon Sang-ho who is known for his animated features like KING OF PIGS. The reason this film succeeds where others fail is down to the characterisation, which is superb for a straight horror tale. The characters are realistic, well-drawn, and appealing, and there's plenty of sentiment while at the same time the film narrowly avoids falling into melodrama.This is a visceral journey that has the viewer on the edge of his or her train seat for much of the running time. It starts off eerie and foreboding and then builds a momentum that never flags right up until the end. The CGI effects are pretty good although occasionally weak, but that doesn't matter a jot when everything else is so well portrayed. The actors impress as always in Korea, putting tons of energy and heart into their performances, and as an action-horror film this is difficult to surpass. I enjoyed every moment.","

"stimpy_tr","3 September 2021","Train to Busan is an interesting zombie movie from a Korean director with completely a different approach. Unlike ""the Dead"" series of George Romero or ""Return of the Living Dead"" series, which are the two major series in the genre, this one does not involve comedy and in addition, the suspense is maintained all the time without digressions. The story is as simple as it can be, that is, a zombie assault breaks out in Korea and spreads quickly to cities and to a train traveling from Seoul to Busan. It has some emotional content and also some twists through the ending. The movie also has a realistic sense as to how people can be cruel against each other under high oppression.","

"JohnDeSando","7 October 2016","""I'll take you to mom no matter what."" Seok Woo (Yoo Gong)This workaholic father, Seok Woo, doesn't realize the ramifications of ""no matter what."" South Korean zombie thriller and box-office phenomenon Train to Busan speeds him and daughter, Soo-an (Soo-an Kim), from Seoul like the titular conveyance through cars and society in a way reminiscent of Snowpiercer. The conceit works well because it can give ample thrills and jump scares while taking a figurative run through society from one car to another.Train to Busan is much more than the sum of the frenetic zombie hordes that terrorize the train in scarily multiplying numbers. It is also about the community joining forces to combat crime, workers facing down management, commoners disdaining government in general, and distracted parents. Director/writer Sang-ho Yeon navigates between the terror and the commentary with effective timing, never letting the flaming story erase the sociological implications, which sometimes are heavy handed.While cinematographer Lee Hyung-deok does first-rate work on the mise en scene (from macro shots of the train and stampeding zombies to action in narrow on-board bathrooms), and editor Yang Jin-mo keeps the story moving and understandable, Train is also about relationships. Although several of the good characters do not make it to the station, those who do are representative of the hope humanity must have in its darkest times. Along the way we do have to experience the silly, cartoonish characterization of the cowardly bus-company executive Yong-Suk (Kim Eui-sung). He could have been a zombie.I can't be sure how much of the South Korean audience embraced the implications of capitalism lying underneath the speeding-train motif. What I know is that for a critic who usually avoids zombie films unless they are humorous satires, I enjoyed Train to Busan as a multi-layered entertainment to appeal to just about anyone who likes to be thrilled by first-rate cinematography, a wild-ass story, and some heady thoughts along the way.","

"Rendanlovell","9 December 2016","Zombie movies aren't quite dead yet. Over the past several years zombies have snuck their way into pop culture, overtaking almost every form of entertainment and putting themselves in the for front as the most beloved ""monster"". There's zombie survival guides, magazines, TV shows, and, of course, movies. 'Train to Busan' is one of those movies. But, as of late, zombies are seeming to wane in popularity. It would seem that the zombie's novelty has started to wear down due to its incredible over-saturation. That being said, when they are done right they remain a rather fun gimmick. Unfortunately, this film is really nothing more than that.It's a fun gimmicky movie that doesn't do too much else. But while it lasts, it's a blast. The film almost immediately gets started showing the slow beginnings of the outbreak. A couple burning buildings, some emergency vehicles darting around, and the occasional convulsing person. This type of first act isn't new or different by any means but it's the fact that we get into the action within ten minutes that makes this movie instantly enjoyable.Despite the dumb family dynamic that the film introduces the opening forty-ish minutes is probably the most visceral action in a movie so far this year. This is largely thanks to the actual filmmaking. The camera-work is all extremely fluid and interesting. There is rarely a moment when I saw a shot and thought it looked bad. The director uses the camera to help build tension instead of just throwing in loud sounds and music.It also helps when the makeup effects and performances are as well done as they are. Obviously, there is a fair amount of blood in this here movie and it's used sparring enough to help heighten a scene, instead just being the scene. And the actors that get the nice close ups as the zombies all do a wonderful job selling it. There are multiple wonderful moments when the zombies fling themselves down thrashing wildly.The best moment is definitely when an army man throws himself off the train and breaks his arm. It just dangles behind his head as he gets up and takes off running. It's these wonderful little touches that make this film enjoyable over a 'World War Z' type of movie. But not everything works in this movie. The script is particularly messy. This feels far closer to a big budget Hollywood movie, except without the budget.The most noticeable bad aspect of the film is the visual effects. Even though the majority of the film takes place on the actual train, there are plenty of times when we move off of said train and the run down world comes into focus. What we get are mostly unconvincing effects that hinder more than help. Fortunately, they are used sparring enough to not be a huge issue.But, like I said earlier, this film's script is specifically poor. This mainly stems from the emotional manipulation that it has. It tries to offer characters that you like but it doesn't develop on them. They are people that have families and the film expects you to just like them for no reason. And since you are supposed to like them for no reason it tries hard to have tear jerking moments.Every time it does, they are horribly predictable and nothing more than manipulative. It pauses the film to have the sappy music and the zoom ins as the characters pretend have emotional moments. Every time this happened, and it does far to often, I just wanted to punch the movie in face and yell, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" If you want to have these moments in your movie, that's fine, but you need to have well- written characters. Or just go non-stop balls to the wall action.And that's where this movie fails. It tries desperately hard to be both action packed and emotional. When you try this hard to strike a balance, one aspect or another will suffer at any given time. Every time the film slows down to have characters talk, I just wanted to die. It affects the pacing in the worst way possible by making this a boring yet fun movie. It's definitely enjoyable to watch and it has a lot of great elements. If you like zombie movies or action oriented movies, you'll probably like this one, but for anyone else watch 'Dawn of the Dead' again.","

"kanyeezy-28832","23 July 2016","Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombiesThese are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies.","

"SnoopyStyle","9 August 2017","It's the start of the zombie apocalypse. The population is caught unaware. An injured girl scrambles onto a train leaving Seoul for Busan. She had been bitten by an infected and soon becomes an infected herself. The infection spreads and the survivors find safety in a few cars. Among the survivors are a girl and her often-absent fund manager father, a strong man and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a baseball team and one cheerleader, and a selfish businessman.This is solid zombie fare. The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters. The action is thrilling and scary both small and large scale. There is good tension throughout. There is one climatic scene that is trying too hard emotionally but that's a small flaw in an otherwise flawless action film.","

Not cause of the Z topic itself but its ability to paint a gruesome and apocalyptical picture. Esp in our current global situation it raised interesting questions about human values and believes. The cluster of Z's trying - under all circumstances - to hijack the railway engine might stick w me for a while. Special shout out to Su-an Kim, the little girl who gave (in my opinion) the best performance by a child actor in a long time.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","15 January 2017","Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.The plot:Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex- wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his daughter. Just before the train departs,a convulsing women jumps on the train.Noticing a large bite mark,Seok-Woo,Su-an soon find their destination to change from Busan to a zombie apocalypse.View on the film:Spending (most) of a two hour running time on a train,writer/director Sang-ho Yeon turns down a comfy seat to lay the track for a white-knuckle ride. Drawn away from Anima for his live action debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of the undead. Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the zombie train on track.","

"paul_haakonsen","7 October 2016","Oh yeah! South Korea is back on the zombie map once again with another overly impressive feature. This time it is ""Train to Busan"" (aka ""Busanhaeng""). And I dare say that with this 2016 movie then director Sang-ho Yeon really solidly places South Korea on the zombie world map definitively.And although most of the entire movie takes place on a train from Seoul bound for Busan, then that is not really a hindrance to the enjoyment of the movie, because there is so much action and thrills to be had along the way that you forget that it only takes place on a train. But having the movie taking place on a train does also add some sense of claustrophobia and limiting the options of the protagonists.The story told in ""Train to Busan"" is about Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) a fairly neglectful father whom is traveling to Busan with his daughter Soo-an (played by Soo-an Kim). A deadly outbreak of infection spreads on the train, turning people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh, trapping the people aboard the train with nowhere to run.There is not really a dull moment throughout the course of this movie, and it does kick up into a high gear early on, and the movie keeps that pace all the way to the end. And that is really an accomplishment for director Sang-ho Yeon.The acting in ""Train to Busan"" is quite good, and it is good to see Yoo Gong in a movie such as this. But I must admit that I was more than impressed with the talents of child actress Soo-an Kim. She was really amazingly talented, and I think that she will go on to have an impressive career in acting.The effects in the movie were quite good, with just the right amount of gore and mayhem without it crossing into the gorefest territory. So this movie will appeal to a wide audience of fans of the zombie genre.""Train to Busan"" had initially slipped under my radar and I wasn't aware of the movie, before someone actually asked me whether or not I was aware that this was a zombie movie. So with that information, I immediately sought out the movie, and there is no regret here at all, because I was more than genuinely entertained and more than impressed with the final result of the movie.I can strongly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Train to Busan"" if you are a zombie aficionado like me. South Korea is making a lasting dent on the zombie world map, and if this is the level of future zombie movies from South Korea, then count me in for the long run.""Train to Busan"" scores a solid eight out of ten stars rating from me; no doubt about it.","

In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10","

"AfricanBro","22 May 2022","""The walking dead"" meets ""Snowpiercer"" but in Korea, it delivers too. It's on par if not better than most of it's Hollywood zombie apocalypse counterparts. It's a great action flick, it's paced well so it has your attention drawn throughout and the end is somewhat emotional. Not everyone can make it sorta thing, but it is a hopeful conclusion. An emotional zombie flick. Despite having a lot of the typical elements you find in most zombie or apocalyptic movies like the type of characters involved, it still feels original because it takes different features from different movies and genres and puts it together to give it a more underived sensation. The zombies were also incredibly quick and I liked that, made for more edge of your seat action without relying on cheap jump-scares; they were just as clumsy and dumb as any typical zombie is but they were made really athletic here so everyone who survived actually had to work for it. As far as imagining a zombie apocalypse could go, this seemed one of the more believable ones with the type of story and how reacted if the situation was ever to arise. I love it when fictional movies still try to be pragmatic and real. But, on that note the only thing that sorta put me off was the pregnant lady at the end, Seok-woo(the dad) was running quick as a bat out of hell with the herd of zombies behind them and she somehow was still keeping up???? She could barely walk at some point. At the end of the day it was trivial compared to scenes other movies try to make believe and it doesn't blemish how good a movie it is.If you're one of those people who don't let themselves watch movies in foreign languages just because they're in foreign languages you really do miss out on a lot because there're so many gems like this one, or parasite, another round, blue is the warmest color etcetera etcetera. These are all completely different movies by the way I just think they're spectacular and there's more if you look.","

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","27 February 2017","Movie: Train to Busan (A) (Why, CBFC India?)Rating: 5/5To be very honest, I had never watched a zombie film in my entire life. I had heard about such films and also realized that mostly Hollywood produces such films. TRAIN TO BUSAN is an exceptional addition not just to the list of the best zombie apocalypse action thriller, but also to the list of best films of world cinema which portray human emotions in the most realistic and heart-touching way possible. Yes, it's that excellent. TRAIN TO BUSAN is the first South Korean film to have a wide theatrical release in India. That attracted too. It was released in India in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. I watched the film first in Korean with English subtitles, and then in Hindi. And I realized that the film manages to convey its message and make you reciprocate emotionally for the film, whether you watch the dubbed version or the original version. The Hindi dubbing was good enough to add to the positive feel.The art South Korean filmmakers know is how to add an emotional feel to different genres. Thus, TRAIN TO BUSAN is no exception as it makes you feel for every character. Gong Yoo takes his performance to a higher level and raises the bar for world cinema actors in the climax. He is extremely likable and excellent. Ma Dong-seok is brave, lively and energetic too. Jung Yu-mi impresses big time with her beautiful & emotionally active character. Kim Su-an is cute & impresses with her strong act in sequences which one can't expect from a child artist of her age. Other actors too deliver performances great enough to make you care for them. The film's scale is big, and the visual effects are amazing. Cinematography is excellent and captures the locales & thrilling action sequences with plenty of intrigue, while also succeeding in sending chills down your spine through the emotional sequences. Thankfully, it's not an Indian film, otherwise filmmakers won't have rested without adding songs & unnecessary romance. Whatever you see in the film, looks very, very realistic. The tension is very well built and neither do you deviate from enjoying the film, nor does the film deviate from storytelling. The story and screenplay are both excellent, and the editing is excellent. The only thing that disappointed me was the A certificate given to it by the Indian Censor Board called CBFC. Why? No nation of the world gave this film an 18+ rating except India & Malaysia. Leave Malaysian Certification system because they follow equal rules for all films Irrespective of the target audience. But in India, films with dozens of gory violence & bucket loads of vulgarity get a UA (PG) certificate. TRAIN TO BUSAN is a clean family entertainer despite the A certificate it has been subjected to. But it's not a mistake of the makers, so there was no flaw I found in the film.Overall, TRAIN TO BUSAN is a must watch film for any movie enthusiast. Irrespective of language and nation barriers, the film deserves to be watched by one and all. And yes, I forgot to tell. This film was the first one that actually made me cry. No film before had compelled me to shed tears, but this film did. Even the emotionless will emote. Such strong is this film. Go, watch it with your family and enjoy it fully, along with respecting the safe life we have from zombies in reality.","

"jamesrupert2014","25 February 2019","In this fine Korean entry in the 'fast-moving zombie' sub-genre, a diverse group of survivors find themselves sharing the linear confines of a high-speed train with ravenous undead, hoping to eventually reach safe haven. I watched an English subtitled version, but thought that the cast was very good, especially 10-year old Kim Su-an as Su-an and Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, her fund-manager father who is forced to re-examine his values in light of the grisly apocalypse. The film is somewhat uneven in the capacities of the hyper-animated corpses to absorb punishment but otherwise the story holds together pretty well (considering the premise is a communicable agent that near instantaneously turns a bitten person into a milky-eyed, frenetic cannibal). Well-made and smoothly directed, 'Train to Busan' is an entertaining entry into a generally bloated genre and impressively for a zomboid film, pulls off affecting, almost moving, ending.","

The main protoganist took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions... I found my self being inadvertently swept from abhorring everything that he was to adoring everthing that he had become... and his daughter.. my oh my... an adorable charming angel yes.. but an exceptionally gifted actor indeed...

It was a very dense film in that there was a tension, emotion, intent, and forward movement at every moment in the film. There was not really any down time, which is what I'm looking for in a thriller. I really liked the lead actor and empathized with him throughout and consider this a film worth seeing even if you're not necessarily a fan of American zombie productions.","

"Woodyanders","6 November 2019","A motley assortment of passengers on a train going from Seoul to Bosun are put in great jeopardy when they find themselves caught up in a sudden zombie outbreak both on said train and in the outside world as well.Director/co-writer Sang-ho Yeon keeps the gripping story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, takes time to develop the characters, ably builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, and stages the attack scenes with rousing go-for-the-throat gusto. Most importantly, Yeon and co-writer Joo-Suk Park bring a surprising pronounced element of pathos and humanity to the premise which in turn ensures that there's plenty of genuinely moving heart to go along with all the harrowing horror. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast further keeps the film on track, with especially stand-out contributions from Yoo Gong as negligent workaholic dad Seok-woo, Su-an Kim as his estranged daughter Soo-an, Dong-seok Ma as the brave Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung as the pregnant Seong-Kyeong, Eui-sung Kim as selfish business tycoon Yon-suk, Gwi-hwa Choi as a scared homeless guy, and Sohee as perky cheerleader Jin-hee. The infected folks are extremely ferocious and frightening. Proof positive that there's still some invigorating life left in the zombie horror genre.","

"siderite","25 December 2016","I love Korean horror movies. Right when the action and horror is at its peak they insert this home like humor that makes you feel for the characters and understand that while the plot might be ridiculous, so is real life.This is not a comedy, like Gowemul, which I really liked, but has some of these moments that make it fun. The scene when the guy apologetically tells his pregnant wife ""Honey, can you run?"" while a horde of zombies approach was priceless.So, yeah, it's a zombie movie. And while it feels fresh, it's nothing you haven't seen before. It's Korean, so it has some specific idiosyncrasies and some of the jokes or social issues it hints at might pass over your head, but it's not that deep.I liked the actors, the kid was really good. The special effects were OK most of the time, but there was one ""explosion of zombies"" effect they used twice without it being needed and it looked kind of stupid. I liked the scene where the ""villain"" kind of explains how he feels and why he did the horrible and stupid things he did. It is important to care about your characters, including the bad guys and the sacrificial lambs. Americans might want to learn from that.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun watching it. Even my wife was hooked by the end and wanted to watch the ending. Keep fresh horror coming, Korea!","

"Tweekums","7 August 2019","Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.","

"christopher-underwood","2 July 2020","I guess this might be referred to as a 'popcorn movie' in as much as it doesn't set out to change the world but just entertain, trouble is I'm just not sure at what point you would have the time to grab a handful and amidst the mayhem there are moments of seriousness and cause for reflection, especially in the midst of our own, very real pandemic. Director Sang-ho Yeon was known for animated films before plunging into this immaculate and superior example of the action movie. There is a brief introduction with scenes of work and private life showing considerable signs of strain even before we plunge into the most devastating and excitingly constructed runaway train with zombies. I guess they are not really zombies but persons rapidly infected in such a way as to display zombie like symptoms. Cleverly we are introduced to the main characters and then shown in terrible and frightening clarity the bloody and warped reality of such a victim. Such is the detail and believability that when more and more and even more are so transformed we are only too aware of the detail. Indeed the director's animation background makes him perfect for using (I assume!) CGI in such imaginative and convincing ways we really believe piles of zombies and tumbling over each other like great waves of living dead. At two hours the film is just about right and I think, looking back, that the reason this almost single set film maintains its momentum so well is partly that it is so well shot. The imaginative use of the camera, as well as the editing, help enormously, as does the restrained but effective emotional involvement achieved through minimal but well judged dialogue between the main protagonists. Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan","

However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10.","

"SilentEyes_","28 December 2016","This has to be one of the finest zombie and horror films in general I have ever seen. Extremely thrilling and captivating from start to finish. Everything in this film has done with passion and care. From the characters and heartbreaking moments they go through, visceral zombie attacks, acting and camera work down to dialogue. Everything works great. This is what World War Z should and could have been. Sure the plot of the film is not original, because yet again we are shown the struggle and survival of people during zombie pandemic, but the way the story is approached and executed is beyond most of the average mainstream horror movies we get these days. If you are a fan of zombie films you will definitely enjoy this horror gem.","

"tenshi_ippikiookami","10 September 2016","""Train to Busan"" is an amazingly entertaining movie, with a few missteps that stop it from being truly great.The story is pretty simple. Yoo Gong's Seok Woo is a man that only cares about his job. His wife has left him and lives in Busan, while his relationship with his daughter is becoming more and more strangled. The daughter (a quite amazing Soo-an Kim) wants to visit her mother for her birthday, and Seok Woo ends accepting. They decide to take the train from Seoul to Busan.At the same time a zombie-outbreak happens in South Korea.Cue lots of violence, running, blood and surprising moments, with a huge dose of feelings (but without falling into the cheesy).The movie keeps things simple: train, zombies, stations, and a bunch of people that will try to survive (some of them will do anything to do so). In that respect it is not especially original. The plot is thin as it comes, but the direction keeps things fast and breezy, and plot developments keep happening non-stop. The direction is a little bit video-game style, but fits the movie. The originality in the fights between the zombies and the survivors is one of the strong points of the movie, with some surprising moments. On the other hand, it can't help but fall into the ""I-don't-want-to-live-without-you"" moments, or some extra saccharine situations. Also, some of the characters' decision-making is just silly, and even if a couple of moments are clearly comedy, the line between comedy and action-horror is not clearly drawn, and some laughs are more on the ""wrong-time"" side. Actually, the movie is not very scary, but it is quite the ride.The acting is quite good, and some, as charisma-oozing Dong-seok Ma, or selfish-as-hell Eui-sung Kim, do a great job. And the music, scenery, and effects keep a good level thorough the film.There is also a quite obvious social commentary, but it does it in a way that it hits target more than misses, and brings its ideas clearly across the screen. This commentary elevates the movie in its lowest moments.""Train to Busan"" may not arrive on time, but you won't care.","

"CinemaClown","24 January 2017","A non-stop locomotive ride that lets the fast-moving & instantly-infected zombies from Brad Pitt- starring World War Z go haywire inside a fast-moving train, this South Korean zombie apocalypse horror is a highly gripping, thoroughly entertaining & consistently engaging journey that moves at breakneck speed from start to finish and keeps ratcheting up the tension throughout its runtime.The story of Train to Busan finds an absentee father & his young daughter boarding a train from Seoul to Busan to meet her mother. But all hell breaks loose when the train is overrun by zombies and results in death & reanimation of numerous staff members & passengers. With nowhere to run, the two team up with other surviving members to ward off the infected until the train makes it to its destination.Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, the film borrows certain elements from Marc Forster's World War Z & Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer but carves an original storyline that's brilliantly executed on the film canvas. Sang-ho's kinetic direction keeps escalating the stakes with skilfully crafted moments of horror and slowly but steadily manages to compel the viewers to invest in the characters' journey & eventual fate.The zombies retain their vicious nature but an added weakness does allow for some suspenseful moments that are expertly carried out. While the movie makes use of CGI in the depiction of the reanimated corpses, the zombies look far more believable than the artificial mess they were in the film they are lifted from, not to mention that even the human characters exhibit an emotional core that was missing in that feature.The dramatic portions, however, are a tad too overblown as the director is unable to pull them off with same zeal with which he carries out the action-horror segments. The technical aspects are finely executed and the film as a whole really benefits from its energetic camera-work, tight editing, excellent choreography, first-rate production design & fitting score and although a few CGI shots don't look realistic enough, it serves its purpose well.Coming to the performances, the entire cast chips in with serviceable inputs and even though the characters they play lack an interesting persona & certain amount of depth, the actors somehow succeed in making the audience get on board with their characters' predicament. While everyone does an apt job in their given roles, there really was no need to add a despicable human character when you already have a train full of zombies so that felt a bit forced.On an overall scale, Train to Busan still makes up for an exciting, action-packed zombie horror and boasts numerous sequences of sustained terror. The build-up is quick and once the train begins to move, it becomes all the more relentless & unstoppable. A few shortcomings like numerous stupid decisions made by a few characters does rob it of its uniqueness but there is no denying that Train to Busan delivers a healthy dose of adrenaline-filled extravaganza until the very end.","

Half of the time it plays like one of the most developed and enthralling zombie films to date, but the other half it plays like a B movie. Act I is rock solid through and through. The rules of the virus and the world it is in were laid on the line clear as day, following a respectable amount of time spent developing our main characters. The rest of the film is plagued by inconsistency with how the virus and the characters behave, which ultimately cripples the film. Even with this hindrance, Train to Busan is not an action film to miss.","

"kevin_robbins","1 July 2021","Train to Busan (2016) is a movie my fiancée and I watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a zombie outbreak and a father and daughter's escape from a city and onto a train. The storylines continues with how the train deals with it's world around them and the father's commitment to the daughter's survival. This movie is directed by Sang-ho Yeon (Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula) and stars Gong Yoo (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God), Yu-mi Jung (Our Sunhi) and
Ma Dong-seok (Eternals). The storyline for this is very compelling and way better than it should be. The audience becomes very invested in the characters and you can't wait to see what they do next. The acting is very good and the daughter/father bond is well portrayed and delivered. The zombies sequence are also well done and you feel the intensity of the scenes. I would strongly recommend this movie and score it a 9/10. One of the better recent zombie films.","

"lee_eisenberg","29 January 2017","Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this.","

Layered, emotional, and riveting, the South Korean product blends human drama, thematic depth, and jolting horror in its tale of commuters trapped within a train while an epidemic rages without. The production is sleek, the violence is biting, and the characters are worth investment. It is the rare horror film whose spirit and energy engender the desire to watch the work again immediately after the credits roll.","

It drags a bit at the beginning, but the undead are quick and horrifying, and the story keeps your adrenaline pumping once it gets going. It's not overly gory, either. This movie relies on the hopelessness of the situation to frighten you. I'd happily add this to my collection of zombie movies.","

"DigitalShark1","20 October 2021","Train to Busan really took me by surprise. I thought it was going to be another generic zombie movie, certainly looks that way by how it's promoted, but once you watch it, you realize just how much care and passion went into this project.Train to Busan is about a series of characters trying to survive a zombie apocalypse onboard a train that needs to get past stops, roadblocks and a ever-growing crew of zombies slowly working it's way up the train.Even though there's such a huge cast of characters, none of them feel boring or forgettable. In short time, Train to Busan establishes distinct characters that you remember the quotes of and cry when they're eventually eaten. The large cast of characters also lends itself to the tense atmosphere of the whole film. No one feels safe from the zombie horde and it's anyone's guess to who gets axed off next.Train to Busan is the most engaging zombie movie I've seen in a really long time. But please god, watch it subbed. I promise you, you might feel the need to watch the dub, but I promise you, it's better subbed. Reading is not that bad, I promise.","

"Rob-O-Cop","13 September 2016","The zombie bits were good but unfortunately the bits in between and at the start were some pretty average family drama cliché. Daddy works too hard and the daughter resents it, school performance he didn't make it to, the Korean relationship dynamic cliché (I really hope this isn't normal in real life Korea but it appears in every relationship in their movies), nagging wife, dumb (huh?) beaten down husband. The self centered baddie is a pretty easy to loath character, so well done on that, the effects were nice, the zombies looked great, sound was great, cinematography was a bit 'digital camera', but passable. They laid the syrup sentimentality on with a shovel and it really drags the movie down, making a 6 instead of an 8.","

"Hellmant","17 March 2017","'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting). I think it definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ","

"parry_na","16 March 2017","This begins with one of the best pre-credit scenes I've seen in a while, featuring a deer knocked down and apparently killed by a flustered van driver. Moments later, the crumpled body in the road judders back into life, struggling to stand. As it does so, we see its eyes – dead and milky. The creature has joined the ranks of the living dead! Next we meet sulking child Soo-an (Kim Su-an), who is upset because her father Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) works all the time and spends no time with her. I have a problem with this kind of thing, and other similar scenes in other films. Perhaps the child would be less brattish if the parents gave up work and instead of a WII (or two) to play with, she had a stick and a clementine. Hardly! ""Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,"" says big soft husband Sang-hwa (Dong-seok Ma) at one stage. Seok-woo, however, has his own story to tell  Anyway, this distant father and child are but two passengers who board the train to Busan, amid news reports of violence and rioting in the streets, and also a wayward passenger exhibiting symptoms of a strange and deadly disease.And we're off. Whilst the rapid transformations of many passengers into zombies relies perhaps too heavily on the actors' facial mannerisms and comes across often as 'over-enthusiastic' acting, there's no denying the effect of an enclosed body of people reverting into killers in some tensely choreographed scenes.My favourite character might well be Michael Ripper-like Yon-suck (Kim Eui-sung), self-serving CEO who does everything, and betrays everyone, in order to survive amidst the spitting, fast-moving zombie creatures. In one of my favourite scenes, the ringtone of a mobile phone in another carriage is used to successfully deflect the attentions of the ravenous pack. Watching them charging as one toward the source of the sudden, tinny music, is very effective.Every possible drop of tension is wrung out into the running time. For a while whilst watching 'Last Train to Busan', I felt there was something holding it back from greatness. Brilliant direction, acting and urgent pacing – however, I couldn't get completely immersed in it. And then, somewhere along the way, that changed and I was hooked. The tension is impossible to resist. What a journey!","

They're formulaic and predictable, with eye-rolling story beats.This movie was definitely formulaic.HOWEVER.Do not get me wrong when I say, that once in a while... Someone comes along and takes the ""formula"" for pulling emotion from the audience and executes it to perfection. Train to Busan does exactly that.It takes every single trick in the book (might as well be a two hour edition of Robert McKee's ""Story"") and puts them all together, nicely wrapped in a bow of constant-zombie-action-engagement.You end up so engrossed in the action that you forget that you're taking in incredible story beats and an impeccable character arc that makes for a massive emotional payoff.Great acting. Great underlying social commentary. Great direction.This premise, if executed poorly, would have made for a super cheesy film. It wasn't executed poorly.Watch. Learn. Feel.","

"asda-man","21 September 2016","Zombie films have been hitting our screens since the dawn of time. Well, it certainly feels like they have anyway. Popularised by George A Romero's terrific Dead trilogy, zombie films have since been rearing their heads like hordes of the undead themselves. Whilst they can be a lot of fun, more often than not, they can also be cliché ridden and trashy. We have had some quite enjoyable zombie films recently such as, Cockneys Vs Zombies and The Horde but we haven't really had a properly great zombie movie since 2004's Shaun of the Dead. Train to Busan changes that.I saw Train to Busan on a whim. I'm travelling in Singapore and had a few free days so I thought that I'd check what's on the cinemas here. Train to Busan caught my eye but I had never heard of it, however I saw that it was Korean and that it had zombies in it, so I was sold! To my surprise, I came out of the cinema having just viewed easily the best zombie film in a decade. Korean films have hardly ever let me down and Busan is no exception.As there's very little coverage of this film on the Internet, I'd better give a rough plot outline. It basically follows a selfish father who is cold and neglectful towards his cute young daughter. For her birthday, she wants to travel to Busan to see her mother so he reluctantly takes her on the train to Busan (creative title) however, a rather inconvenient zombie outbreak occurs as they board the train. The rest of the film is a claustrophobic and thrilling fight for survival as the survivors desperately try everything in their measure to get to Busan on a undead-infested train.What makes this film so great is the characters. Most horror films (particularly ones with zombies in) sprinkle a load of disposable characters in who all die in a predictable order. We don't often particularly care when they die, in fact we're more likely to relish the gory death shown in all its bloody gory. In contrast, Train to Busan focuses in on a line of memorable characters who we actually care about and want to see survive. They're developed in such a way that when someone cruelly perishes, we feel a great sense of loss and emotion. This is where the film's strength lies. What's also interesting is that they're not all stereotypes either. The protagonist isn't your typical hero, he's a character who is grossly selfish and unlikable at the start, but he subtlety develops into someone you begin to care about and admire.The film starts off as a good little zombie thriller. There's a sense of realism to the whole situation as we're made to watch the panic unfold on the train in an effective way. There's also a nice comic touch to the whole thing with some witty dialogue so it never takes itself too seriously. It also somehow never gets boring even though the film is essentially two hours set on a train, which is no easy task. There's always tension and a sense of peril. You get the feeling that anything could happen to these characters at any given moment. Once the film reaches the mid-way point though it stops being good and starts becoming great.Things get going fairly quickly so the characters develop through the action, making the film all the more gripping as it goes on. It's an unpredictable ride with lots of thrilling set- pieces to keep you on edge. The final half hour is essentially non-stop action and it becomes exhausting to watch without ever feeling too ridiculous. What really impressed me though was the emotional charge in the second half. There are a few scenes which had me welling up with tears, which I wasn't expecting. I just got so absorbed in the characters and their intense situation. The use of music and editing is also hugely effective in pulling at your heartstrings.There's really very little which Train to Busan does wrong. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that I would've liked more gore. Zombie films always give a good excuse to give us an array of fun, gory effects but this film is surprisingly restrained. There's a lot of hand-to-hand combat and nothing else creative. However, this does sort of add to the realism of the situation as you're not going to find many axes or chainsaws on a train. It's still not as bloodless as World War Z.I can't urge you enough to watch Train to Busan, especially if you're a fan of Korean cinema. It doesn't just offer plenty of nail-biting thrills and impressive special effects, It offers emotion and splendid characters whom you can properly invest in. It's a powerful film which wears its heart on its sleeve and contains more character development in two hours than The Walking Dead has in six seasons. Once the film was over I became overcome with emotion. I felt like I could just break down and cry at what I had just watched. This is so much more than a zombie flick, at its heart it's a devastating drama about family and the importance of human kindness. I loved it.","

"mrrcott","25 September 2016","You may think you know all about zombies but have you wondered what it would be like to be on a train with fifty of them all running after you and gnashing at your ankles?Zombies on a train is the premise of this film, a big hit in South Korea. If you had no idea this film was a horror, or that it featured zombies, it might be quite exciting but I imagine most people will go into this knowing exactly what to expect.Some kind of catastrophe has led to an outbreak in which dozens of writhing undead are roaming the streets of Seoul looking for their next victims. A group of travellers including main lead Gong Yu are on the train to Busan. They've barely gone twenty minutes before there is clearly something wrong with some of the passengers. Checking the situation on their phones, the passengers see that the country is in a state of emergency.Cover.jpgThey try to leave at the next station but find that the soldiers who are waiting for them have already been bitten. The most exciting and tense scenes are when the group must flee back on to the zombie ridden train, running away from swarms of rabid recruits. Once back on its a long journey for the remainder of the film. Here's where the film runs out of steam. Once you've seen one zombie, you've seen them all. The film becomes a very standard struggle for survival and the scenes of characters running down train corridors become very repetitive.It's not a bad film. Its directed in expedient fashion but for a train film its seriously lacking any ambient sound effects such as the clickety-clack sound you would expect of a train on a track (or do South Korean trains run completely silently?).Fans of zombies will not be disappointed.Otherwise, it's more of what we've already seen many times over.My score: 6/10.","

I would say the supporting characters are some of the best and well written characters I've seen in a horror genre...ever. I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character. The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment. I thought they did a great job creating a space and environment that really added to the story in many layers. It was thematic, metaphorical, helped pace out the film, and overall it was a great visual. This is a must watch.","

"tomgillespie2002","6 August 2017","Train to Busan, Sang-ho Yeon's hugely successful South Korean zombie movie, may just be the most effortlessly enjoyable action movie to feature the brain-hungry undead in years. Taking inspiration from the maestro who created the 'zombie' we know and love today, the late, great George A. Romero, as well as Danny Boyle's faster and scarier flesh-eaters, it's a wonderfully constructed and nail- bitingly tense piece, which manages to mix action, horror and a bit of family drama into two hours of pure entertainment. It also finds time to deliver a message amidst the carnage, and one that is perhaps more relevant than ever in these unpredictable times. In the most hopeless of situations, we must ultimately look out for one another if we are to stand a chance of surviving. Train to Busan condemns those who are willing to sacrifice others to save their own necks.Workaholic fund manager Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) is the kind of father who always seems to be on his phone at important family events. Divorced and single, he occasionally looks after his young daughter Soo-an (Su-an Kim) in the apartment he shares his mother, but pays such little attention to the girl that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, forgetting that he got her the same present the previous year. What she really wants for her birthday is to see her mother in Busan, but Seok-woo is so busy at work that he is unable for find the time to accompany her on the 2 hour round-trip. After taking some advice from his mother, he eventually agrees. They arrive at the train station safe and sound, but it's clear that something isn't quite right. Police and ambulance sirens whizz by, people are running in the street, and the news reports show mass unrest and rioting across the country.Before the train doors shut however, a sickly woman gets on board. She soon collapses and starts to convulse, only for a poor train attendant to tend to her and wound up bitten. It's a big train however, and Train to Busan starts to clearly establish the collection of characters on board. There's a tough husband and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a young cheerleader, a rich and selfish corporate type, and an entire baseball team, who are handily packing many bats in their luggage. Panic soon sets in as the realisation of a zombie apocalypse dawns on the passengers, and with much of the country either in quarantine or overrun by the military trying to fight off the unstoppable hoard, its unclear just where and when they can stop. Seok-woo's intentions are to look out only himself and his daughter, and teaches the seemingly wiser Soon-an the same. But as the situation becomes increasingly dyer, it becomes clear that they are stronger together.The atmosphere and tension are turned up to the max during some incredibly inventive set-pieces, which often make the most of the most mundane of locations. These are the running, screeching zombies of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, so cramped train carriages are quickly turned into narrow isles of death. As the passengers learn the zombies' weaknesses, such as their inability to work out a door handle or how they quickly forget about you once you're out of site, the darkness of long tunnels become their ally as they journey from A to B. Sang-ho Yeon is careful to keep the social commentary at the fore, highlighting how fear can turn the nicest of people into selfish, despicable monsters, and how important it is to fight out primal instincts in moments of terror. After a fast-paced first hour, the events become somewhat repetitive and the running time could do with some trimming, but it all pays off with a gripping climax. In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh.","

"kevin_newdirections","8 September 2016","Nothing turns me off more than when zombie films gradually derail from character development and fall into the trap of gorefests and amusement killing just for the sake of it. Train to Busan, however, restores my faith in the sub-genre as director Yeon Sang-ho does not treat his characters as mere cannon fodder. Each character arc is well-contemplated, the established relationships may not be equally potent with each other, but for a film to wrestle with so many of them while successfully maintaining the edge-of-the-seat tension, the result is quite brilliant.We can see positive character growth in the main protagonist, Seok- wu (Gong Yoo), a divorced, workaholic fund manager/""corporate bloodsucker"" who consistently neglects his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). We get to know that he's not exactly father-of-the-year material, he buys his kid a Nintendo Wii for her birthday oblivious to the fact that he already one to her earlier the same year. He reprimands her daughter's misplaced kindness during the zombie invasion, ""In times like this, you have to think for yourself first."" Few scenes later, the girl says to him, ""You only think about yourself. That's why mommy left."" Boy, he just got ""re-educated"" This kid is going to be her dad's moral compass throughout their eventful ride to Busan.Busan also includes a group of archetypal commuters to make this horrendous experience relatable to a wider audience: a pregnant woman (Jung Yu-mi) who's heavily relying on her brawny husband (Ma Dong-Seok), a pair of elderly sisters (Ye Soo-jung and Park Myung- sin), a pair of high-school sweethearts (Choi Woo-sik and Ahn So-hee) and a stern-looking businessman (Kim Eui-sung). The last person to hop in, however, is a girl with a strange bite on her thigh. We know where this heads now but the train crew seems to be more alarmed at the presence of a homeless man (Choi Gwi-hwa) hiding inside the washroom. Alas, once the infected girl rips the throat of her first victim and the zombies start to chomp and multiply (Hold the door! Hold the door! Hodor!!!), the film starts to categorize its characters: the selfless and the self- serving. These zombies may be the film's antagonist but there is a much more unsettling beast at the face of damnation: society quickly adepts to a new set of morals. Earning his spot as one of the most hated cowards in history, Eui-Sung's businessman character is the epitome of greed in this film. As he literally flings his fellow survivors to the undead for the sake of self-preservation, the point is clearly made that this is a dog-eat-dog world, whether it is the apocalypse or not.Whereas its obvious competitor World War Z shows a city-wide scale of apocalypse, Busan proves that confining it to a smaller scale is not a hindrance to deliver well-choreographed and jolt- inducing action sequences. Needless to say, my favorite part of this film is when the three male characters start to navigate their way through the carriages, each station proving to be more difficult than the last one. It certainly helps to know that these morphine-driven, break- dancing zombies have a flaw to them: they can only see or hear but they can't smell and they're also not taught how to open doors. Once those rules are established, director Sang-Ho levels the playing field by turning tunnel drives into game cheats, washrooms into sanctuaries and luggage compartments into unlikely safe passages.Train to Busan may not reinvent the zombie sub-genre per se but director Yeon Sang-Ho has a clever use of technique for this film to work both as a grisly form of entertainment and as a potent social allegory as well. For that, he solidifies his spot as a go-to- director when it comes to zombie films. The buzz for this film is totally worth it.","

"Hey_Sweden","6 February 2017","Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.""Train to Busan"" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clichés, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10.","

"manuelasaez","23 January 2017","This film had me at a crossroads; one the one side, I am a lover of South Korean cinema, and I feel that the country is doing more to advance the art form than any other country. On the other hand, the movie was tame, simplistic, and devolved into a typical Hollywood style blockbuster, with none of the nuance and tact usually found in S.Korean movies. I had heard such great things about this film, and as excited as I was to see it, I just could not shake the feeling that it was limited by either the producer, the country, or the creative team. Where it could have been gruesome and disturbing, it aimed to be tame and heartfelt. I don't care about the human condition when it comes to Zombie films. I care about the Zombie's, who they kill, and how vicious they could get away with showing it.The acting was superb, and the cinematography was indicative of a very talented creative team. Why this didn't yield a more transcendent and original film, I will never understand. It really did seem like the team wanted to do something grandiose, but kept their reigns pulled back in order to not offend, disturb, or frighten their audience. Basically, a Zombie movie that isn't frightening just isn't worth your time. While Train to Busan was a great film (even by South Korean Standards), it could have been so, so much more. At it stands, it is simply an entertaining film from a talented team of creators and actors, and I suppose that this should be enough for any fan of horror films to give it a watch.FYI; If you want to see a truly entertaining, graphic and unique Zombie film, I would suggest watching the Japanese movie ""I Am A Hero"". It is objectively the best Zombie film of 2016, and deserve any real horror fans time and attention. It blows this movie so far out of the water, that it is not even a contest.","

"jahnu-14536","27 June 2022","I enjoy Korean media, and Train to Busan was no exception. Zombies are a little overused, but after much time stuck on the train, you feel genuinely worried; claustrophic, even. You don't expect everyone to live, so the progression of the story feels just about right. The character development feels real and genuine. The storyline is decently captivating and keeps you hooked until the end. The situation definitely seems futile.As far as horror movies go, it's not THAT scary, but definitely worth a watch!","

"tmattso2","27 March 2017","This is my first review on here, and I was so blown away by this film that I just had to come on here right after viewing it to share my experience! First off, all I can say is WOW! My heart is still racing and I still have tears in my eyes (and I honestly RARELY cry in response to any film)! The characters are so well-developed and right from the beginning (and literally to the very LAST moment of the film) I genuinely felt for these characters and felt like I was actually with them, experiencing a huge range of emotions from fear to sadness to even some funny moments, all which are very sincere and portrayed by top- notch acting. I'm so tired of all the bad, cheesy, cheap movies on Netflix, but after reading so many great reviews of this film I decided to give it a try - and boy am I impressed! This is not your typical zombie film - Hollywood, please take note of this - THIS IS HOW A ZOMBIE MOVIE should be! It explores so much more than just ""zombies"" - it shows what is at the core of humanity and society; it explores ethics and what people will do in a crisis and to fight til the end to survive - all without going too deep or being too corny. The cinematography is incredible and the acting is really what blew me away - especially the little girl - I admit she won my heart and I was crying along with her at the end when her father sacrifices himself for her and the pregnant woman. If a film can truly make its audience care so much for its characters like this film does (kudos to the director!), it ups the tension even more and we feel a true connection to these characters - WOW! That is a RARE but fabulous thing! Please watch this movie - even people who don't like ""zombie"" movies will love it - perfect mix of horror, drama, and suspense! I love how the director used a very claustrophobic atmosphere and whittled it down to being even more claustrophobic - amazing! You will not be disappointed! I was glued to the screen the entire time while watching this! The best zombie movie ever - and don't let the subtitles turn you off - it is not overly dialogue heavy and the subtitles do not distract from the film! What a thrill ride! I'm still on the edge of my seat! So impressive, especially it being a foreign film - that might turn some people off but give it a try - you will not be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I'm a huge horror junkie and it is a rare thing to have a horror film affect me so much - but this is more than just a ""horror"" film - it connects its audience with its characters in such a way that you actually feel like you are on this train to Busan right along with them! I can honestly say that I felt cramped, claustrophobic, and on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this (and I admit I LOVED it! What a ride)! I'm just so overly happy that I finally found an amazing film on Netflix! ""Train to Busan"" is by far the best film I've seen this past year! Simply blown away. :-D","

"youngcollind","11 June 2021","Train to Busan doesn't reinvent the wheel so much as it plays to the strengths of what can make a zombie film entertaining. Focusing on the moral quandaries that can arise in such an extreme situation gives a humanity and intrigue to the otherwise familiar territory. It also successfully leans into the action genre, and the fast paced narrow escapes make for non-stop fun!","

Looking forward to watching Peninsula which is the follow up to this film and due out soon, covid permitting.","

Great and quite original plot, that keeps your attention for the whole two hours. We get a very good acting, especially from the little girl. The soundtrack was also perfect. Unlike any American happy ending story, this Korean film doesn't try to show any mercy to it's heroes. I had only one remark: in the train they discovered that zombies couldn't see in the dark. So why did they escape the train straight away, if they could wait there for the night to come? I highly recommend this movie to everyone, 10/10.","

"fciocca","21 June 2020","Through years I have watched many movies and shows about zombies, but after ""Train to Busan"" I think I will have many difficulties to watch something else related to this genre. This 2016 movie is something unique and original.First of all zombies here are truly scary, they are fast and dangerous and if someone is catched, will probably die. Most characters are likeable and it is easy to bound with most of them, but the movie does not make any discount, if someone has to die, he or she will die, no matter how good he or she is. The movie starts off slowly, in order to introduce context and characters and then buildup gradually the tension.The movie is hard to watch, not for his violent scenes, but because it managed to create a pretty convincing and realistic scenario, if a virus of this kind would exist in our world. Basically this movie was able to accomplish what many other shows were not able to do in years.","

"bob the moo","1 July 2017","A lot of hype about this zombie film, and while I normally do not like these types of films (because they scare me), I decided to watch it. The plot sees a distant father escorting his young daughter back to her mother in Busan when some sort of outbreak occurs, and an infected gets onto the train. From there the film sees the infection spread across the train as an increasingly small group of survivors try to hold on in the hope that some stop will provide safety. In terms of narrative it is pretty straightforward, although at the same time it is a very limited space to make the action last for almost 2 hours – particularly since the zombies are more or less unstoppable.The film uses some convenience with vision to give the characters some breathing room, but mostly it does this by making us care about the characters. While they are essentially fairly obvious genre standards in the main, they are reasonably well done to make us care for them and invest in their struggle. This adds weight to the stakes and the decisions made. The film uses this well, and delivers a pretty well paced film. I thought that it was just a touch longer than it needed to be, but it comes in waves, with nice touches of respite along with intense scenes of attacks and chases. With this the writing does well to come up with different ways to have the zombies almost about to attack quite often – whether it be cracking glass, the dark of a tunnel, or so on. The emotional side of the film runs alongside this, and it is surprisingly affecting at times, although some key scenes at the end are a bit marred by the rather heavy use of music.The film does have blood and horror, but it is nicely light on the gore aspect; I dislike horror films which make a point of giving us real good looks at gore. Instead Busanhaeng lets the pace and tension and characters do the work, and I often found the pressure to be almost too much. The cast play well to this, whether it be the fear and regret of Yoo Gong or the gruffly likable Dong-seok Ma; even those playing more generic characters worked well enough to make it play. The film has received a lot of hype though, and this probably doesn't help it. It is a very good zombie movie, which does well to have plenty or horror but also delivers characters we feel for and want to survive, however it is still a zombie movie and mostly does just what you'd guess it will do – albeit that it does it well.","

"LansTaylor","8 September 2019","One of my favorite zombie movie, though parts of it was very predictable. I went into it blind with very little expectation but enjoyed the rollercoaster I was strapped on to.
The characters were okay. I know they were trying to invest a lot of dialogue to keep you emotionally attached to each death but I wasn't feeling it. The hobo guy should've died a long time ago but they kept him around so that there would be someone to save the pregnant women and the kid. The dads death at the end felt forced and was completely unnecessary. He only died for dramatic effect purposes.
I did like one character though, the train conductor. He was always cool, calm, and collective. He tried to save as many people as he could but that ultimately lead to his demise.
It's a good movie but not something I would watch again any time soon.
Though I am intrigue to see how Train to Busan part 2 will unfold.","

"christian94","8 May 2017","(If you want to skip zombie pseudo-history, please go directly to the fourth paragraph for the film) Train to Busan (2016) is the ""best Zombie movie ever"" like a few reviews mentioned, but I am not a particular zombie movie fan. In fact I may have seen a dozen and do not watch The Walking Dead (2010) but do highly recommend ""Men Against Fire"" episode of British Black Mirror (2011) sci-fi TV series as a perfect example of social, philosophical, psychological and political warfare examination with a mutant premise, akin to zombie in some aspects. Korean anthology of short films Doomsday Book (2012) had ""A Brave New World"" segment that dealt with Seoul zombies in a thoughtful, sensitive way, while Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007) film (segment of Grindhouse) was the best zombie movie before Train to Busan (2016). They surpass classics DAY OF THE DEAD (1985), 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) but I haven't seen George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) or his earlier NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Re-Animator (1985), Dead Alive (1992), Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) are supposed to be lots of fun. The Evil Dead (1981) and The Evil Dead II (1987) are excellently cheesy and gory and zombie-like enough to include here.Yet, from all these United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) productions, perfection of the craft within the genre has not been reached. Western origins of Zombies (Haitian voodoo) and Vampires (Eastern Europe) and popularization in the US and Western Europe has not allowed a fresh look at the genre (fresh flesh?). Now Asian cinema is taking things to the next level with its innovation and history with effective horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and Jee-woon Kim's Coming Out (2001) are some example of the best Vampire tales every shown and they are from Iran and Korea.Train to Busan (2016) is a zombie film that is also a great action movie and a drama that holds its own weight. The characters are admittedly mostly one-dimensional but the dramatic action, moments, movements and details make it memorable and palpable. The main relationship is a failed father-daughter relationship that is fleshed out enough to be felt at many crucial moments of the film. Secondary characters are also important and contribute greatly to the narrative and emotions. The couple expecting a baby are the perfect counterpart to our main characters while other (regular or bizarre passengers, train personnel, baseball players) play adequate parts. The suspense is real even if you need some suspension of belief at many moments! This is an action-packed ride and expertly paced. The dilemmas are non-stop and drama keeps unfolding until the final frame. Zombies are scary and cool, the cinematography and special effects play well into the narrative. The tension is well created and the twists and turns keep on coming even if a few or far-fetched or questionable, the majority of the story is strong and holds together. More than anything this is a fun, fast and relentless ride with people we get to care about in an impossible situation after the other. What movies are made for, more or less. In this case: more!No reused Resident Evil (2002) profitable but predictably poor franchise here. I hope to also check out the animated work from the same director including a companion piece zombie movie set in Seoul...","

The acting is decent, the special effects are meh. To be fair on that part, these were all newly infected people, so there was no decay to show.What I found interesting about this, as it comes from a culture where honor and class are so essential to the daily lives of the Koreans, that it lent another layer of story to the movie. One man, a powerful business man held sway over the passengers, much to their detriment.All in all a decent zombie movie, though no where near as good as some on here seem to think it is.","

"ajohannaewing","5 September 2021","Yeon Sang-ho is a filmmaker guru and genius in that he can trick your emotions into an expectation but then completely warp your heart to feel afraid, angry, devastated, and soft all at once. He will terrify you and then make you cry hysterically. There are very few films that can move you in such a way. Train to Busan is one of those films. Oddly enough, I watched Psychokinesis after skipping over it on my streaming service for months. I'd run out of options for good science fiction so I buckled and tried it out. What a fool I was for misjudging that movie. It was so incredible that I had to see more of Sang-ho's work. I had heard incredible things of Train to Busan but, similarly to my preconceived ideas of Psychokinesis, I had my doubts of how a zombie film could be... well anything but a zombie film. Boy was I happily wrong. Much to my surprise, this film was not average in the least bit whatsoever. How dare I call myself a film lover if I've never seen Train to Busan? It moved me to a place I was not ready to go to but I am glad I went. This movie is epic, horrifying, and brilliant- An utter masterpiece.","

"kluseba","25 January 2017","There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.""Train to Busan"" convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"", the epic ""Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016.","

"lukas-ingel","20 April 2020","Yeah so if you watch this movie, I think it's hard to deny how good it is. The action, production, acting combined with both horrifying elements and heartwarming and heartbreaking character moments throughout, it's quite the ride (pun intended).
I really thought I was gonna like this movie a whole lot more up until the ending. Spoilers*! of course.
There were a few pacing issues going back and forth between this big character moment and this big character moment and this big character moment, which honestly made me feel like watching a few insanely good episodes of The Walking Dead back-to-back (not to really compare the two in any other way as they are entirely different). So when it came to the ending, it didn't quite stick the landing for me. At that point, I was very emotionally invested with the characters and it felt kind of like cheating how they killed off the main hero like that and give him his moment and it just...The acting was insane (deserves way more credit than it even gets, especially the little girl), but I honestly had trouble feeling it as much. You just keep seeing this thing throughout the movie and the pay-off for the death is so minimal and such a cowardly low character to bring this faith to the story. (And I do appreciate what they were trying to say but I think the point came across more than once both about status and simply about being humane.) It honestly only upset me that it was what happened, and when we see a very iconic shot of the two remaining survivors at the end walking together, I couldn't help but feel like they definitely earned that moment but so did the dad, and I just didn't feel it as much cus my emotions had just gotten zoomed out. It's like hey, the team behind this movie wanted to do everything to make you cry and even put in shots of the girl as a baby, which could be fine, but it just wasn't quite earned and it pretty much messes up the satisfaction of that ending. Not that we need happy endings or even a bittersweet one but dang... Earn it, don't draw it out and suddenly kill off the hero like 15 other people with these moments because suddenly he can't throw this dumb person off a train in eight attempts despite what we just been seeing for 2 hours, resulting in a cut scene from Grey's Anatomy mixing newborns with melodramatic death scenes.
Unfortunately, that just leaves me having not gained quite the impact I expected from the first and second act and not even half as satisfied as I were with them, bringing me to that I'll still call this a mostly very good movie... overall.(I certainly hope there is not going to be an American remake of this ever, that'd be too bad. But with its great universal sale, upcoming sequel and high quality production matching some of the best we get from Hollywood, I hope and suspect that it won't be the case. This stands perfectly in its own roots.)","

You are on the edge of your seat throughout this whole movie rooting for the good guys and wishing the bad ones were gone and celebrate when they get infected. I can't believe how lightning fast these zombies turn and lunge to their kills. It's totally shocking what you see. I truly really liked this movie and definitely want to see the sequel.

This one character was stupid where he selfishly threw other people to the zombies so he can escape even though he turned into one after falling on the tracks. I also think that the father of the girl should have just thrown him off the train instead of being so kind to him and then get bitten on the hand. He should've survived with his daughter.","

"libby-75255","16 October 2020","This movie is beyond incredible. As someone who hates zombie movies I went into this expecting a few cool action scenes and nothing more. But boy was I shocked and amazed by what I saw.This movie is the only zombie movie I've ever seen that actually brought me to tears more than once.The characters feel so real and their reactions are the cornerstone of this picture. The characters do not react in your typical ""cool action movie"" way, blowing zombies away at every turn. No, they are afraid, they are confused, they are selfish, they are human. They react in the way real people would react in this kind of situation. Some step up and go after zombies, some stay behind in fear for their lives, and some are putting others in danger to save their own skin. The reactions and characters are so diverse and I'm sure if I went in depth, each one could easily represent an aspect of human nature in survival situations.The setting is perfect and the things that happen are as realistic as a zombie movie can get. A huge moving train packed with zombies, no way to communicate with law enforcement, and no way to see what's happening in the outside world other than the TV. The only thing they can do, is survive until the train stops. This mix of danger and being left in the dark creates tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, praying for the characters safety.Speaking of the character safety, in this movie, no one is safe. I won't go in depth with the more gruesome moments, but rest assured, nothing is off limits. You truly get the sense that anything could happen to these people at any time.The emotional parts of this movie are also an enormous strength. Since the characters all feel so real and so thought out, whenever one dies it feels like a stab in the heart. Even when an extra dies, the acting is so well done that instead of the typical ""there goes another one"" feeling typical of zombie movies you get a feeling of dread, that's constantly encroaching upon everyone involved.All in all, this movie is a perfect example of what a zombie movie can truly be, instead of the same action star schlock usually made. I encourage everyone to watch it at least once, to experience one of the best movies of all time.","

"brycebclark","7 January 2017","Overall, the plot and development of the story were engaging throughout. There were only a few forgivable occasions when the verisimilitude and consistency of dialogue, characters, and story were waning. To be completely fair, I really enjoyed the suspense kept throughout the entire film. The cinematography and editing captured the chaos of events really well and the deaths were neither predictable nor overdone. In the end, the protagonist reconciles his prior shortcomings and the film ends full circle. My only grief is that I wish they would have saved more characters, allowing each group to find their own way out the train station after the separation (which would have been more realistic) instead of killing everyone immediately and leaving just the daughter and girlfriend as the focal point (which is the standard but so very typical.) I also wish the writers and director would have explored the night-blindness of the monsters in an open urban setting (imagine if you had discovered that these monsters were absolutely blinded in darkness; why would you not have shared this with everyone and made your escape plans to accommodate that huge advantage?) There was huge potential with that, so I am slightly disappointed it wasn't utilized more significantly. But, in total, I think the film managed a 7/10.On a side note, I'm expecting some of these negative reviews are biased against the film for being of Korean origin. Also, the subtitles can suck.","

"grantss","31 December 2022","A father and his young daughter are travelling on the KTX, a fast train from Seoul to Busan. One of the passengers has been infected with a virus that turns them into a zombie. The passenger then attacks and infects other passengers. Soon it is a fight for survival against overwhelming odds.I am not a fan of zombie movies. They tend to be incredibly formulaic and predictable, largely relying on the same plot and plot devices. Train to Busan is different. There's character depth, making you care for certain characters and elevating the engagement levels. It's not just a zombie drama, it's a human drama and a very good one at that. Some very emotional scenes, especially towards the end. Some good moral themes too.Even as a basic zombie movie it works incredibly well. Director Sang-ho Yeon does an excellent job at heightening the tension throughout the movie and the action scenes are great.On the negative side, some of the fallibilities of the zombies seem a bit contrived or selectively applied. Some plot developments similarly do feel a bit too neat.These are minor issues though and overall this is a great film, an edge-of-your-seat ride yet with some great emotional and character depth.","

Filming, directing and scripting! It was Strike, hahah!But let's go! Why is it so good? The movie is frenetic! It doesn't let you think about going to the bathroom or even picking up the popcorn that fell on the floor! From start to finish it's an adrenaline rush! We were nervous and on the edge of the couch with the situations that the characters find themselves inside the wagon! The script has been making every situation unexpected that you really can't help but be nervous!A very interesting thing about the film is that even though it's not a Hollywood production, all the makeup and visual effects don't leave anything to be desired, on the contrary, they are fantastic! Another detail is that the film has originality, tell me a zombie movie that takes place in a subway? No, pow lolFurthermore, the film does not make it easy for the protagonists, everyone suffers and has difficulty doing everything! Zombies Run!! They are way too fast!","

"danielharden","30 October 2017","The horror genre has its fair share of hits and misses, however, it would seem that the sub genre of zombie horror suffers from the greatest ratio of misses to hits. Yes, the genre does have George A Romero's Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead, as well as, spoof film Shaun of the Dead, but it would appear that is all we have. One must think hard to find a decent zombie film that doesn't end in ""of the dead""... Until now. Director, Sang-ho Yeon makes his live-action debut with what is in my opinion, the best zombie horror film ever. 2016's Train to Busan, or Busanhaeng as it's pronounced in its native country of South Korea, is more than just a simple zombie film, it's ultimately about evaluating what matters most in life, as well as being a social commentary of Korea's government and perhaps even our own.Train to Busan's success as a horror film could be boiled down to a singular detail, character development. Countless horror films don't take the time to establish and expand upon their characters, resulting in little to no tension, people you more or less want to die and the audience's overall detachment from the film. The social messages of Train to Busan demand fully realised characters for them to have an impact, and fortunately, the filmmakers choose to flesh out a number of characters rather than a limited few. The film's main protagonist, Seok-woo, is a father who prioritises his work over his family, now having again disappointed his daughter, Soo-an, Seok-woo reluctantly agrees to take Soo-an to see her mother in Busan for her birthday, but of course, the zombie outbreak makes things a little bit more difficult The film is primarily the journey, pardon the pun, of Seok-woo as he's forced to be the protecting father he wasn't pre-outbreak and witness the consequences of his actions as a fat cat businessman. As well as this, the film features a married couple expecting their first child, however, the father has yet to name the baby. I for one, found the couple and their love for each other to be the most impactful and engaging. Train to Busan also features; a sports team where one member and a cheerleader have an off and on relationship, two elderly sisters who care deeply for one another and a selfish business owner who I believe represents the ruling class in Asia. Train to Busan is rich with subtext, making it more of a mental and emotional journey than a physical one.In addition to the emotional message of human life matters most, Train to Busan is contextually relevant in the modern day. With North and South Korea technically still at war having never signed a peace treaty, but more importantly, North Korea's constant threat of nuclear attacks and Donald Trump Well Doing what he does best as president, adding fuel to the fire and being racist So it's safe to say things are pretty sh*t in Korea at the moment. Train to Busan takes aim at the ruling class, from the fat cat businessmen like our protagonist to the government itself, controlling the media and thus the people to fit with their political agenda. The continent of Asia is no stranger to censorship and unquestioned authority figures such as dictators, and so I believe Sang-ho Yeon is attempting to highlight the errors of totalitarianism by effectively bringing a ruling class man to the ground, to see the errors of his ways and the ways of those like him. The shoe is on the other foot and together with the breathtaking performances from the films cast along with the films character development, this message is made all the more powerful.It isn't all serious however, there is a lot of fun to be had and the film is incredibly entertaining. The action set pieces throughout Train to Busan are large in scale, visually stunning and seriously impressive. Visceral imagery takes the place of cheap jump scares in this competently directed action horror film. Yeon wants to scare you with the culturally relevant subtext, in conjunction with horrifying imagery, instead of simply relying on a loud noise. Director Sang-ho Yeon also understands the horror genre, its themes and concept. It's all about fear, but not just of a killer, a ghost, a vampire or zombie etc. Horror can be the fear of anything and Yeon has made a film that is more about the fear of failing as a parent, disappointing your family and fearing for your country, than it is about the fear of zombies. The human fear amongst the supernatural is what truly makes Train to Busan the best of its genre.The world is a scary place. The divides between the rich and the poor remain intact and the threat of war is ever-present. Yet humanity does exist, there is light in the darkness we just have to open our eyes to the horror of others. Train to Busan is a poignant, relevant and phenomenal film which takes the audience on the same emotional journey as its characters. It's an extremely tense film thanks in no small part to the phenomenal cast and use of character development. This film can be read on a number of levels, I just hope people see it for what it truly is, a social and political statement highlighting the lack of humanity seen in the modern day.","

They went out of their way to spend oodles of Won on special effects, blood, train wreckage, etc.The acting wasn't so bad, either. Boy, these zombies could movie.What sunk the film was the studio's (or director's) incessant interesting in wringing out as many melodramatic tears from their audience as they possibly could. In the end, it seems like the film was geared towards a specific audience - grandmothers who'd never seen a horror film, or any film, in their lives.After the end of this flick, if you're a casual moviegoer, you feel robbed, kinda like sitting through a movie you didn't know what just a commercial for Christianity or Scientology or whatever in the end.

The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie. I take my hat off to all who worked to bring out this picture and the director Yeon Sang-ho .","

"coreyjdenford","28 October 2016","This is my review of Train to Busan (spoiler free)**** (4/5)AFTER SEVERAL YEARS of the boring, brooding and sort of manipulative over pretentious plotting on The Walking Dead over the last couple of seasons adding some lazy new characters and even lazier walkers, in addition to that the lazy, inept copycats with a lot of action but not enough story or character depth the zombie sub-genre has felt a little bit tired and somewhat overused at points; it needed a breath of fresh air to come back to life thankfully one man writer/director live-action debutant Yeon Sang-ho's Train to Busan brings the fresh air that the sub-genre sorely needed and does it in style. The story is simple and very straightforward as the film opens with Seok woo (Gong Yoo) a man with a workaholic lifestyle as a hedge fund manager and is always absent from his precocious young daughter Soo-an (Kim Soo-an), the two then take a train from their home in Seoul to Busan, at the bottom end of the country but as a suspicious passenger boards the train and what started out as a general commute turns into a train of horrors, as most of the passengers turn into a mass horde of ravenous flesh-eating crazies and the survivors have to survive the vicious attack and outrun the infected to survive.It may sound like a general zombie film with a very familiar premise but the good story and clever plot adds a lot of tension, a masquerade of zombies and high-octane action that refuses to take a break but when it does the film adds in a lot of drama and character depth to points where it's needed. For its length at a total of 118 minutes it is a bit longer than most traditional films of this genre but the pacing of the story is astonishing as for the first 45 minutes it teases the audience with a lot of memorable zombies, action and some terrific heartfelt and harrowing drama that's unpretentious fun. Instead of meeting traditional standards of other zombie subgenres and killing off some new characters as soon as they are introduced as shown in Cell earlier this year this goes with introducing new and important character that are instantly lovable. Two of these characters we meet very early on, a man Song Hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who doesn't take to Seok as soon as he meets him because he thinks that he is just a rich business man who doesn't care for anybody but himself, and his young pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Jeong Yu-mi), who falls in love with Seok's daughter straightaway. These two characters are instantly lovable and add a lot of drama to the story where it's needed. Though for some parts Song has to put up with Seok and even has to fight through some of the horde in a scene when they are both heading towards a car to find Seok's daughter they have to fight through some of the zombies, however they find out that they can't see in the dark – it's a very enjoyable concept to story that is both action packed and inventive genius as there has other no other film with that kind of intuitive genius. At one point in the second act the train has a stop at Daejeon station and it all seems fine to that passengers and looks like it hasn't been infected but the passengers get attacked by the fast infected, but how fast are they? Imagine Usain Bolt on steroids; that fast. However the survivors don't have guns to defend themselves from the infected which is another enjoyable additional genius to the story as there are far too many zombie sub-genre films that rely on guns for defense, this should be a lesson for Hollywood to take in that guns aren't always a good thing. Although the film isn't flawless not by a long way as the infected are strung together by heavy amounts of CG rubber no, it's not a sequel to World War Z, there is also an elderly man who tries to block Seok and some other survivors out of the rest of the train tries saying that they are infected he's more loud than good and there are zombies that don't die from falling out of a window.The third act is the most dramatic as it offers some heavily impacting heartfelt drama that is guaranteed to make even the most cynical person roll in flood of tears as the train reaches its final descent towards its destination there are some heartbreaking deaths with some of the more lovable characters that leads to an ending which could see a sequel being made that has already been announced. Aside from familiar premise with World War Z and 28 Days Later and the length of the story this is a brilliant, ingenious, and terrifying zombie film that adds a lot of tension with lovable in-depth characters giving brilliant performances, director Yeon Sang-ho's no nonsense story never ceases to deliver and it proves to be just as biting as Bong Joon-ho's dystopian sc-fi thriller Snowpiercer this original story is a breath of fresh air that is better than other Hollywood films of this sub-genre, so we can all breathe again. In short, the zombie sub-genre is back to its best and in terrific style as this could easily one of the best zombie films ever.VERDICT: A purely terrifying, original and no nonsense roller-coaster ride filled with fast paced high-octane action, memorable zombies and harrowing emotion that refuses to stop as it delivers a lot of bite; easily one of the best ever zombie films.8/10 Brilliant.","

"Falconeer","19 October 2019","If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it. I also doubt that anyone over the age of 18 that has more than 5 brain cells will think highly of this extended TV show.","

It has very emotional moments, very well done, not overdone to the point of unrealistic or pathetic, but very well balanced. Action scenes are amazing, you can help but to root for most characters (not all, there are few characters you want to see dead, but even they are not just evil machines, they show some humanity here and there), zombies are quite frightening, not slow and fragile as we used to see but fast, agile and very dangerous. It's amazingly well done movie and it's hard not to be invested in main characters.Having said that, second movie we really really didn't need. Ever. Don't watch it, it will only spoil the first one which is great.","

Like most such films, this one avoids the classic but little-used-now voodoo or necromancy explanation for the reanimation of the dead, but unlike most others it does give an explanation for the phenomenon. This could have taken up half the film and weighed it down considerably, but the writers introduce it through a few deft touches which both explain what is happening and fuel the tragic plot. The cast does a good job (from what I can tell without knowing Korean), and both the action sequences and quieter moments are engaging.Horror fans will mostly like this, but it should appeal to others too, since its central characters and their predicament have universal resonance.","

"TheRedDeath30","20 March 2017","I know. I know. If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of zombie movies. Many will rise to defend the sub-genre of horror. After all, there are only so many tropes and monsters that you can explore. In the same breath, one could say you are tired of vampire movies or ghost movies, but the fact is that I would say I am tired of all three. Maybe ""tired"" isn't the right word. I am skeptical. I have seen the originals that created the structures, the next wave of zombie films that re-defined what you could do with it, then every twist on the genre directors could come up with, from comedies like SHAUN OF THE DEAD to dramatic presentations like MAGGIE. Mostly, I am tired of every indie film maker with no better idea then to do a zombie flick devoid of imagination. So, it really takes a lot to impress me at this point, which makes it all the more surprising that TRAIN TO BUSAN is able to do just that.There are two major things that make this movie work incredibly well, the action and the characters. The action elements of this movie is what will get it attention from the largest segment of audience. The fact that this is the first live-action film for the director is even more impressive. He cut his teeth in animation and it definitely shows. The movie has a kinetic sense of action and pacing that is straight out of an action cartoon. The movie feels almost like a comic book or cartoon come to life, in many ways. I could make many bad train puns here, but the movie feel like a ride on a steam train. It starts off slow and plodding, setting up the story, the characters and the angles and the movie slowly picks up more and more speed, until arriving at a fever pitch towards the end. That action is gripping and once it hooks you in, it doesn't let go. You will be on the edge of your seat as the movie takes you for a ride.I said, earlier, that the action would hook the largest audience. Plenty of people just want an action-packed film and there is nothing wrong with that, but I know my friends in the horror intelligentsia will want a little something more on their plates, and this movie does not fail to deliver in character. The plot is pretty straight forward, zombies on a train, but what makes the movie really special is the characters. The plot revolves around a workaholic dad who agrees to take his young daughter to see his ex- wife. We see that the two have a very strained relationship, which naturally evolves through the course of the film. Along the way, we pick up additional characters. There is the drifter that portends the action and plays a pivotal part. The tough bruiser and his pregnant wife, who are important pieces in the relationships that will develop and prove to be much deeper than they appear in the surface. There is an a*hole businessman, who will sacrifice anyone to save himself. To a less defined degree, the baseball player and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend, who aren't as fleshed out as other characters, but provide a few interesting scenes.Many zombie purists will not like the direction of the zombies themselves. At the risk of incurring the endless, tired debate of which are the best zombies, you could argue these aren't zombies, at all. They are ""infected"". They are much closer to rabid, chaotic horde of the DAWN remake, or more so, WORLD WAR Z, than the shambling undead of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE WALKING DEAD. That last comparison is an interesting one. For all the people on social media complaining that the popular show is too slow, too boring, too talkative and there isn't enough focus on the zombies, this is almost the antidote. Full of action and full of zombies.The movie has two big things going against it for a western audience, it's sub-titled and it's another zombie film. For that reason alone, many will avoid it. They would be doing themselves a big disservice as this movie is one of the best of last year and a great modern zombie flick.","

"witster18","14 December 2016","It isn't perfect. Some of the CGI could be tightened-up just a bit. THere.That is the only criticism I can think of.""Train to Busan"" is a superlative zombie film. Most films in this genre suffer from unrealistic and inconsistent moments. Well, it's a zombie movie so I guess calling it unrealistic is a bit moronic, but you know what I mean. The zombies acting inconsistently, or other stuff that just doesn't make sense. No character arcs, or many unfinished subplots and forgotten references also seem to be common weaknesses with these types of films. NOT HERE.This film does nearly everything flawlessly. It does follow a cookie-cutter template, but the Koreans follow that template and create a near perfect zombie film.The pacing is fantastic. The set-up is slow and methodical but effective, the build-up accelerates like a ZR1, and the stretch run has you glued oooey-blueey to the flat-screen. The characters are perfect, blending seamlessly and falling perfectly into the storyline of the film. The main roles are acted to perfection but I keep going back to the consistencies of this film that make it so great. Every moment when I anticipated an inconsistent action or scene - it failed to come. Instead, it handles every transition, every character, and every zombie tradition with painstaking care. The actions of the zombies and characters, and the timelines, set-structure and locations are laid out perfectly.Now, I'm sure there are many great films to come on my 2016 watchlist. I have 47 of 89 films still to watch, and many of the higher anticipated films are sitting in the un-watched portion. But, for now, ""Train to Busan"" joins ""Hell or High Water"", ""Deadpool"", ROgue One"", and ""Zootopia"" as my favorite films of 2016 so far. It's right in the same class as ""28 Days Later"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", and ""Pontypool"" for me. Truly. An instant rewatch. A next day Blu-ray purchase(if avail today - hmmm). The film, despite some small CGI shortcomings, is better than most in that respect, and the overall look is still great. The film doesn't tackle some of the normal eradication subplots, and I think the movie is better for it. While the template might be basic, the execution and flow is anything but.This is one of the best Zombie movies ever made. I wouldn't be surprised if this 7.6 current rating climbs a nitch and settles around 7.7-7.8. It's a solid 8/10 for me, and may honestly be the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It certainly gives ""Night of the Living Dead"", and a couple of others(ROTLD,SOTD, PONTY, 28, DOTD,RE-Anim) a run for their money.Flat-out AWESOME zombie-flick. If this is your bag - I would save the rental money and just buy it - you won't regret the decision or the savings.No need for a ""you'd like this if you liked"" list... 84/100It's not scary... it's just really, really entertaining.. and makes recent American Zombie flicks look pretty awful if you ask me.","

"masonsaul","10 November 2020","Train to Busan is a ridiculously tense horror that's scary, visceral and surprisingly emotional with effective social commentary. Gong Yoo, Ma Dong-Soek and Kim Soo-Ahn are all incredible. Woo Sik-Choi, Jung Yu-Mi, Sohee and Kim Ui-Seong are all great. Yeon Sang-Ho's direction is superb, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced, relentlessly tense until the very end. The visual effects are fantastic and the music by Jang Young-Gyu is excellent.","

"marmar-69780","21 July 2020","Train to busan was a great change in a already very stoic and familiar formula and koreans were able to make zombie film to feel brand new and fresh,that is maybe because we are not watching some random people fighting the infected on a streets on some city but rather we feel connected to all characters that are put in a very awkward situation in a very claustrophobic train,when we talk about fight scenes and chases they were made in a very good way,acting was also very good expecely since this genre isnt know very much for great acting,in movie there were two great scenes that i will remember for some time,first one is in beginning with deer and second one when infected were trying to climb train,train to busan is defienetly one of most fun movies about infected people or zombies but it lacks more quality to be on par with some old classics","

"Pairic","14 July 2019","Train To Busan: It got a mediocre review in FT magazine, 5/10. From the opening scenes of a cynical farmer who is told of a minor leak from a Bio-Research Laboratory this film scored high imho. The farmer runs over a deer and after he leaves it comes back to life! He's beHind you!Most of the story takes place on the eponymous train. A Bond Trader is taking his young daughter to his estranged wife in Busan when the Zombie outbreak occurs. These are fast zombies who bite and chomp and swiftly turn their victims into the undead. A School Baseball team use their bats to good effect. Some social commentary as well which would be worthy of Ken Loach but its not laid on with a trowel.The Zombie action works well and we mostly encounter fresh Zombies as they haven't had time to deteriorate. They run, they swarm. Nothing original but its used to good effect as is the character development of the (still) human characters. 8/10","

"fredrikgunerius","5 August 2023","With its serious dramatic approach and scientific accuracy (within its realm), this South Korean genre-crossover was able to revitalize the zombie apocalypse sub-genre and find wide-reaching success outside of Korea's borders. Gong Yoo plays a fund manager and non-attentive father who must travel to Busan with his daughter Kim Su-an in order for the girl to spend time with her mother on her birthday. As they board the train, it becomes clear that the so-called riots that have been reported from the streets of Seoul are actually a lot more serious than that, and Gong Yoo must navigate an increasingly more dire situation aboard the train while reconnecting with his daughter.Much like I Am Legend, Busanhaeng manages to transcend the often quite confining zombie sub-genre by treating it like something unknown and unprecedented. Our protagonists don't recognize that they're in a zombie movie (why would they?), making their situation more absorbing and tangible for us. We relate to their feeling of not knowing what to do. And the human drama unfolding borrows cleverly from some of history's better disaster movies. Busanhaeng became the sixth highest grossing film of all time in South Korea. Lead actor Gong Yoo later went on to star in the TV-series ""Squid Game"".","

Relentless zombie horror film from Korean filmmaker Sang-ho Yeon (who co-scripted with Joo-Suk Park) where an outbreak occurs while a train is en route from Seoul to the titular town with an atypical cast of characters (harried father with daughter in tow; pregnant woman; baseball team; dickhead CEO) that is given flesh and blood turns by its talented cast (you root for everyone amidst the horrific carnage unfolding). The claustrophobia mixed with sudden dread is altogether palpable and incredibly poignant.","

"funnycommentor","14 August 2023","First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I kinda liked it, even though I didn't really had high expectations about that movie. Eventually, it was a nice movie and I really enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was really interesting and kinda innovative (because, there aren't any other zombie movies that they were placed in a train). The storyline was very well written and everything was well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting and kinda likeable, even though they weren't very well-developed. Gladly, the filming location of the movie (the train) was really good. It wasn't a very scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, but it was really intense and full of action-filled scenes. The killcount of the movie was really bloody, even though nothing explicit was shown. I have to admit, the ending scene was kinda emotional, even though it was kinda predictable. Also, the zombie's appearance was really creepy and they were kinda terrifying. Overall, ""Train to Busan"" was an enjoyable zombie movie, intense, kinda bloody and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for the remake of that movie, ""The Last Train to New York"".","

"phd_travel","1 January 2020","As clear as day after watching ths movie I'm totally convinced that this Korean Zombie movie is the best zombie movie ever made. It is breathtakingly exciting with a whole range of interesting scenarios on and off the train. To top all that there is a relatable bunch of characters father and daughter husband and wife etc that are involving, endearing and clearly identifiable. In terms of excitement and enjoyability this is just way above WWZ or Zombieland and all the other recent zombie movies.","

"P3n-E-W1s3","21 September 2018","I had this movie sitting on my ""YouView"" box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this ""little"" Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight ""buzz"" about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on ""Train To Busan""...By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing.","

"alexklatt-28518","23 April 2019","This movie stinks. Here's the setup: a man works too much and has a daughter, and they're going to take a train to see the girl's mother. Got it? Good, time to get to the action.Zombies show up. The only kind of cool part of the whole movie is the creepy way zombies tend to come pouring out of windows and doors. That's seriously the highlight. People stand around like slack-jawed cattle waiting to be slaughtered. They watch people get eaten alive, with expressions on their faces that suggest they're instead looking at somebody being mildly rude at the dinner table. The undead monsters blessed with superhuman speed are able to kill rooms full of people seemingly within a minute or two. However, when they try to kill one of the main characters, they're about as dangerous as a chihuahua with teeth made of bubblegum. Doubly so if they go against the big cool guy, who can beat down train cars full of zombies without breaking a sweat. Anybody bitten by a zombie turns into a bloodsucking monster within 10-30 seconds, unless they're a main character or antagonist, in which case it takes forever so that it's DRAMATIC.This movie has the good old fashioned 'let those people die, because maybe they're infected' cliche. Except it doesnt make ANY SENSE because like I just said, people TURN WITHIN 30 SECONDS.One by one the protagonists sacrifice themselves heroically, and the bad guy tries to kill them for actually, literally no reason. Also the zombies can't see in moderately dim lighting conditions, and they can't catch up to a lady who is about 7-8 months pregnant.At the end, the little girl and the pregnant woman are the only ones alive. They're about to get sniped for no good reason, until the girl sings the song she wanted to sing for her dad I guess. Everybody's heart strings get horribly tugged. Or if they're like me, they thank god that it's over. Frustrating, inconsistent, illogical, cliche, completely lacking in tension. It's bad.","

"Mysterygeneration","13 June 2022","""Train to Busan,"" an action-horror film, pulses with locomotive power. Yeon Sang-ho's nihilistic image of humanity has been toned down in order to appeal to a wider audience. ""Train"" is a must-see for Asian-friendly genre merchandise buyers.Yeon presented a homeless community within the major railway station as the epicenter of a zombie epidemic in ""Train to Busan."" In ""Train to Busan,"" humans and zombies are divided by carriages, symbolizing the perilous divide between society's haves and have-nots.The action accelerates with exciting mayhem, aided by the confined train compartment structure. Resident Evil has a deliriously high level of energy and agility, as if they're fueled by ginseng and soju. Fans of Yeon's more edgy cartoons may miss his ruthless villains. The film's humanitarian qualities counterbalance the zombies' insensible violence. In the final act, the screenplay ramps up the hysteria and schmaltz.Yang Jin-mo's fast editing and Jang Young-gyu's music are among the best contributions to the trade.","

"UnderworldRocks","10 January 2017","Some of the characters' behaviours in the movie are laughable. For example, the first time the passengers got out of the train only to find the station infested with zombies. What was their reaction? Run back and open the door to a car already full of zombies! Smart move, people!For another example, a bunch of survivors in car #15 refused to open the door for another group of survivors, because some guy feared the other group might be infected. Actually, one easy solution would be for survivors in car #15 to move to another car, for instance, car #16 and let those people have #15. Car #15 was not the only safe place. But... They were too dumb to make room, those idiots.The beggar character's heroic move at the climax makes no sense. He had always been portrayed as cowardly. Therefore, the sudden 180 degrees change is not convincing at all.Let's not forget the laughable ending. The little girl suddenly felt like singing after the disaster? Yeah, very interesting. It would have been so much better if the soldiers had killed both the pregnant woman and the girl. That kind of dark ending would have made an impact. The current one in the movie is ridiculous.The plot was predictable. You could always guess who was going to die next. The movie is not even scary, and the amount of gore is atrociously little.I guess the only good thing is the opening scene where a deer became a zombie deer. That was interesting enough.","

"Kamurai25","27 July 2020","Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.This one really had me yelling at the screen: I was heavily invested....until I was basically emotionally exhausted. I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.This is a fascinating premise. A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies. I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4). The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses. There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act. Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die. I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times. It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.This movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints.","

"Reno-Rangan","24 January 2017","A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!8/10","

"joebloggscity","21 October 2018","I've had a big thing for Korean horror films from the 2000s in particular, but of late have lost touch. I was recommended this movie to sit down and watch, and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be.Zombie films have been done to the death (no pun intended) over the past decade or two, and there have been some very interesting and enjoyable movies over a number of genres. However, this one sidesteps the problems some others have by having a good director, budget and good cast of actors with a fine script. Avoiding the slapstick, comedy or torture porn route, this is a story about redemption for a father out to protect his daughter and discover the human within. Okay, that's not exactly wholly original (e.g. War of the Worlds etc) but it does have heart and keeps you engrossed.As per the name of the film, the travellers are stuck on a train to Busan from Seoul along with the zombies, and we have action without too much gore/violence, but really tension and emotion as we watch our protagonists try to survive this catastrophe. There are some cliched characters, for example the older selfish rich businessman and the old couple etc, but really you can't change everything. It still works.Granted this doesn't have any social commentary like some that made the zombie genre famous, e.g. the Night of the Living Dead, but in its own way it is a refreshing change on the low budget or comedy-centric comedies that have abounded of late in the field. I really enjoyed it. Bit concerned if they make a sequel, but that will be inevitable. Worth a try.","

"ivanmessimilos","6 January 2024","In general, I gave up on horror. Most of them are not of good quality, they don't have a good story, the only goal is to scare the viewers with cheap jump scare scenes and make money with good marketing. And then I finally decided to watch this movie, which has been on my watchlist for a long time. Another zombie movie, right? Wrong! This is a very high-quality film with zombies, and the emphasis is not on them. I'll say this right away, this is a real little masterpiece. The reason lies first in the excellent script, where we have a good story and flesh and blood characters, and the zombies are just an addition to that, not the main part.The scenes with zombies are excellently shot, tense, visually great, and it's even a big plus that the action takes place during the day, so the darkness cannot hide the flaws.The real treasure of this film are the characters and scenes that serve us to breathe between tensions. They don't last long, but they are very important to us in order to get a better insight into the characters' situation. If we know the characters, if we understand them, then we care about them. Something that most horror movie directors have forgotten.A film in which there is not a single redundant scene, in which I would change absolutely nothing. Perfection from the first scene to the last.","

"wcoleparks","21 June 2016","With such a high presence in both TV and film, zombies are becoming over used. Our fascination with them seems to quickly be coming to a close, so it takes something special to stand out. First time live action director, Sang-ho Yeon, has managed to craft a unique take on the undead by placing them on a train and adding a few things to their mythology. Despite underdeveloped characters and an overly sentimental final act, Train to Busan delivers a fresh take on the zombie movement that contains some extremely memorable set pieces. The story revolves around a father who is taking his daughter to see his ex-wife. Yoo Gong plays the typical father who is more concerned with work than with family and does not always put people as his top priority. His daughter is the typical kid who knows how important other people are and always tries to do the right thing. This is where the film really falters. The characters fit perfectly into stereotypical roles and never feel like anything other than placeholders. There is the typical villain who never seems to die, the typical female characters who must rely on the men, and the group of people who blindly follow orders. There is one excretion however. During the train ride, the father and daughter encounter a couple with a child on the way. The man in this relationship is charismatic, charming, and above all, badass. When everything is about to go down, he is quick to suit up and prepare for a fight. This is the one character in the entire film that stands out and quickly becomes the reason you root for the characters to make it out. There is also an incredibly emotional scene involving this character that really hits hard. The build up to the scene works well and because we are so attached to him, anytime he is at risk the stakes are raised. The scene is effective and almost brought tears to my eyes. This scene should have been the emotional climax of the film. Unfortunately the film goes on for about 30 more minutes and involves another emotional moment with the main character. This second scene however is not effective at all. Through flashbacks and an awkward script, the scene becomes cheesy and at a certain point comical. It didn't work and really took away from the previous emotional climax. Typical of the zombie genre, the film does contain a social critique. Similar to Snowpiercer, the film uses its setting to comment on the class system and the social order we fall into. The businessman is ultimately the boss as he is superior in pedigree and it is up to everyone else to follow him or be cast aside. Additionally his character perfectly aligns with the dog eat dog world we live in today as he uses others for his own advantage. As he throws people to the wayside, literally to be devoured by those around them, it is clear the point that is being made. Also borrowing from another film, the zombies here are fast. Just like in World War Z, they act like swarms of insects as they barrel through doorways and windows creating a sense of urgency slower zombies often fail to establish. They also look great. There are a few moments when they all swarm together, where it is clear CGI was used, but for the most part they used practical effects. The zombies move with disjointed, quick movements that make them very terrifying. It is almost painful to watch them contort their bodies as they converge on their victims. The real unique characteristic though is that they cannot see well in the dark. This trait provides the basis for a number of intense set pieces as characters use sounds to mislead the zombies and navigate the claustrophobic setting from train car to train car. Another great set piece involves the characters getting off the train. It appears as though they have reached a safe zone, but once they realize that they are mistaken, it becomes a race to get back on the train. Characters are killed, people are injured, and bonds are formed as people realize how much they need each other to survive. It is a nice diversion from what we have seen so far and gives the audience something different, yet equally intense, so the action doesn't get repetitive. In the end however, the film does fail to keep us engaged. In the last 30 minutes, the film really starts to drag. The action is not as effective and then builds up to the disappointing emotional climax mentioned earlier. At this point, I just wanted our characters to reach safety, or die already. The very last scene however does work well. In a film filled with brutal action, it was nice to end on a heart-warming moment.Train to Busan (2016) Directed by: Sang-ho Yeon Screenplay by: Sang-ho Yeon Starring: Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, and Woo-sik Choi Run Time: 1 hour 58 minutes","

"ambusched94","17 December 2023","Definitely gets worse once you rewatch Train to Busan. The tone and screenplay bill this film as a realistic zombie horror film, but the actions and choices of characters, and the try-too-hard-to-be-original plot are comically dumb. The pregnant lady would've been dead in the first round of zombies. It's not believable that they left some characters survive when they wouldn't be able to run fast enough given their pregnant condition or even old age. The main father character is not likable and gets to be grating as the plot moves along. A lot of pacing issues in the middle and the climax was too melodramatic, and wasn't that sad given the father wasn't very likable from the start; so all of a sudden they want to redeem him that way? The conclusion is uninspired and too drawn out, like just end the film already lol. However, the editing of the zombie attack action scenes and gore makeup used on the zombies was effective. Not a rewatchable zombie film.","

Dang zombies...Fraternal emotions aside, this is a darn good zombie movie! Zombies on the train make for a lot of stressful situations and crazy conditions! And these zombies movie in a disturbingly herky-jerky way that really freaked me out! Especially the female attendant toward the beginning! And that dear at the start! Yikes!

"dcarsonhagy","27 December 2016","""Train to Busan"" weaves a tale--and very good one--about how much life is worth living and how we ALL take it for granted. The story starts with a father and his daughter boarding a train in Seoul destined for Busan. Little do they know their innocent trip will eventually end in a fight for their lives and everyone around them.What I enjoyed most about ""Train"" was the characters were REAL. Each person played his/her part with panache; therefore, it was easy to feel for each of them. From the homeless man who boards the train with a foreshadowing message to the self-centered father, every part is just as critical as the others. To me, it would be hell on earth if this kind of outbreak happened: nowhere to run; nowhere to hide.""Train"" is rated ""R"" for violence, language, and disturbing images. It takes the zombie genre to a completely different level with its superb acting and photography. In Korean with subtitles, this one is recommended.","

"nialleveritt","14 August 2023","Reading all the positive reviews for this film makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. It's NOT a good zombie movie. It's a predictable and often frustrating watch.When will someone write a good zombie movie that doesn't constantly insult the audience with the same old tropes?I want to see people behaving realistically. Not standing stock still and staring into each others eyes whilst the hoard gets closer and closer. Why has no one in a zombie movie seen a zombie movie?Aside from the above, we're strung along with the old story of the selfish businessman who must undergo a process of growth etc etc. If you genuinely think this naff subplot adds depth and ""heart"" (as so many other reviews do), you need to consume some better culture.Overall very disappointing. Could've been 30 mins shorter too.","

Yes, I can admit that there were a few wonky decisions made by some of the side characters at times, but for the most part, the acting in this film was stellar (not just for the main cast, but for the zombie actors too, they were terrific).I think people these days have grown to anticipate a protagonist that is selfless and immediately likeable, but South Korean cinema often transforms their lead characters through experiences, or sometimes would just outright highlight the 'dual' aspect to human nature, which is to make 'good' or 'bad' decisions depending on the circumstances.I gave it a 9/10 because it is in my all-time top 5 zombie films list, and because it can be re-watched many times and still be entertaining.","

"SpoilerAlertReviews","12 November 2016","""We are sorry to announce, that the 9:53 service to Waterloo has been cancelled due to a zombie outbreak"" fortunately, for us in the UK, the chances for widespread outbreak via train networks is somewhat diminished due to strike action, bad weather and foliage on the tracks. (Joking aside, I actually like and praise our public transport and yes, I have and do, use it a lot) We've had bombs on the bus, terrorists on a ship, snakes on a plane and now, zombies on a train. Korean animation director, Sang-ho Yeon gives us his live action feature debut which happens to be a sequel his animated feature, Seoul Station that came out earlier this year. There's no doubt, Sang-ho knows this genre well and all the elements of great zombie movies are predominantly there, especially the anxiety you feel for the characters being ferociously chased, willing them to ""hurry the f$% up"" and moments of sudden disappointment when people are bitten or lost. It's like The Walking Dead cramped into one carriage. It's an obvious storyline, that's doesn't really derail however, fortunately, that doesn't mean it's a total predictable fare, because it isn't. There's some clever elements that set a brilliant premise for key scenes and fights for survival. But in a nutshell, zombie outbreak, that leaks onto a fast moving train. The characters are brilliant and are a mixture of flawed unlikely heroes that perform outrageous heroics in order to survive and protect their loved ones. Central to father and daughter, They meet a multitude of other commuters that's reminiscent of classic disaster movies like the Poseidon Adventure or Tremors. Yoo Gong plays the neglectful father who reluctantly escorts his daughter to Busan; the daughter played by Soo-an Kim, who is simply amazing being the kind-hearted, curious and fearful child. Dong-seok Ma has to be my favourite and you'll see why, as he punches his way through the hordes of undead; the platform rush in particular was epic. There's one character who is so awful, I have not hated any other character quite so much since the dickless Walter Peck from Ghostbusters. But there's the typical business man, pregnant lady, granny, baseball- bat tottling teenagers and a hobo among the passengers. There's actually quite a lot of emotional content, with some selfish stupidity and righteous retribution. The chemistry between the characters is conveyed greatly with dilemmas, difference of opinion and fear either dividing them apart or bringing them together. The zombies themselves come as standard issue, usual makeup, script and costume, and as zombies come, they look and act the part superbly, but what makes these a slightly different breed from your usual face-munchers is their unnatural movement, which can only really be described as body-popping, like the casted a bunch of street dancers to play the zombies adding a more quirky and grotesque style of zombie. It's pure brilliance and class, and certainly one of the best zombie movies I've seen. Incredibly action-packed for the 118min runtime and doesn't let up from the moment you first encounter the infected. A must for all zombie fans.

I don't mind foreign films and coping with subtitles as there are a lot of foreign gems out there of which this is one. 
On the whole after watching it I felt this was set at the same time as World War Z, just from a South Korean point of view. 
The action was well placed and kept you going confined on the tight space of a train it felt claustrophobic and again reminded me of the zombie outbreak on the plane in WWZ.
The one scene that got me was the little girl singing Aloha Oe such a lovely song anyway but her singing it and crying after what she'd been through....just wow","

"Prismark10","28 April 2019","Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies.","

"Imdbidia","12 March 2017","Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it. What was the origin of this zombie outbreak and how was controlled? That is never properly explored or explained. I could forgive the first question, but the second I thought it was unavoidable. Original? No. Good, Yes. Entertaining? Very. Satisfying, just partially.","

I don't know for sure but it seemed once the action really started it all happened in real time which added to the suspense. I do not like gory films and it would seem that this would be one, but it really was not. Sure lots of blood but no guts flowing freely or gore just for gore's sake.

"SoumikBanerjee1996","25 September 2020","What differentiates ""Train To Busan"" from the rest is its immaculate character expansion & a profound piece of social commentary!
It may insinuate as another generic Zombie feature but trust me when I insist it's more than that.'Zombies' when you hear the word, you may be prodded by the never ending Resident Evil Franchise or some individual ventures by Hollywood studios! No matter how you got your firsthand experience with this type of Horror but I'm certain; you either have lots of fondness or a box full of disgust for these.
Zombie Movies have always gained traction from audiences'. Especially for its exaggerated Tonality. Albeit a tried & tested formula for box office success.
Yet most of the times makers get it totally wrong. They fixate so much on its extravaganza that they kinda forget about fundamental nuances.'Train To Busan' is evidently diverse in that case. Crafted by utmost maturity, this not only showcases usual tropes of the Sub Genre but also provides an underlying Socio Political attire which considerably indicates our Class partite society.
All of the characters in here, portrays distinctive thoughts and ideologies! They all come from different backgrounds resulting a versatile input into characterization aspect!
Their convincing acts had helped in that regard as well.
The storyline showed its efficacy in emotions! Teared me up good, not gonna lie.
Cinematography is great, for a South Korean production they undoubtedly nailed on the technical front.Except the Soundscore!I might be in the minority here, but the soundtrack didn't seem impressive to me at all! It felt highly incapable of generating fitting emotions in certain sequences!
I'm not saying it's trash; could have been miles better though!
Another negative would be its marginally stretched screenplay which caused its necessary momentum to break oftentimes.
It also had inconsistencies throughout the plot in terms of writing & detailing.
Bearing in mind possible spoilers, I'm staying away from any sort of explanation but you will understand.Still I can comprehend all of your affection for it! This is more than a mindless Zombie execution which had strong sentiments underneath unlike any iterations we might have watched previously.","

Seriously, this is better than almost all zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood in the last 10-15 years. In some ways, that's sad to say, but it's reality, zombie movies have become full of clichés and recycled plots. They're either a gore-fest, or they attempt to mix in some comedy with it, and you just get a terrible mess of a movie.This movie is absolutely nothing like that. It's like watching a really good drama movie, but with zombies. I was surprised and impressed, definitely going to look into more movies from their director.","

Its a joyride finish to end. ALl the actors play their part perfectly for what the script gave them. It may be a little lighthearted and not gory at all. But that wasn't the intention here i believe. It's a zombie film to just sit back, drink a cup of coffee and enjoy. and for what it does. It's excellent. The only little thing I can complain about is the world war z cgi piles. Even if many other zombie films does something better here and there. many of them have great set design or really badass zombies but they falter big time through the rest with some silly side story or a super boss zombie demon or some other crap. Train to Busan Is by far the most perfect zombie film I ever seen.","

"Mivas_Greece","14 December 2020","Movie with zombies. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind, this is one of the top. Korean cinema, as always, invests a lot in emotion and is superior to everyone else. A film, slightly superior to which I consider only ""I am Legend"", which far exceeds the average of the genre. The train to Busan, a journey during which the zombie epidemic begins, and among the last passengers is an injured and infected. It's already too late after turning into a zombie. Where is it safest as the epidemic is underway? Inside the train on the move or outside? Survivors try as hard as they can to keep the zombies restricted in some wagons of the train, but for how long? An endless journey, where the destination is doubtful. Very good script development, building some characters, others with ideals, others altruistic and others extremely selfish. Who will finally manage to survive? Will there be justice? Very good performances, good direction and makeup, and a great ending, with a lot of emotion. Recommended to all fans of the genre, one of the best movies of its kind ever released.","

"TheMovieDiorama","27 February 2018","Flipping heck this was an emotional rollercoaster. It's a simple formulaic plot: we follow a family or group of people, a viral outbreak occurs, lots of biting and blood whilst ending with some sacrifices. ""Go! Save yourselves! I'll hold them off""...y'know, that kind of heroism. We've seen it all before. What makes this refreshing and exciting is the actual emotional connection we form with the characters. They aren't all just expendable, they do indeed have some soul. A struggling father to a daughter, a pregnant woman with her devoted partner, a young loved up couple...and a COO of a massive company. Before I begin, I have to let off some steam. The COO was the biggest (try not to swear!)...ummm...coward ever (phew...that'll do). He absolutely boiled my blood. Infuriated the flip out of me. I stood up and simply shouted ""SOMEONE KILL HIM ALREADY!?"". Yet somehow I related to him. In fact I related to most of the characters, they each had individual strands of different personalities that made the plot compelling. It's about self-sacrifice and willing to help others rather than being selfish. Our lead character undergoes this transformation exquisitely, the pressure of survival moulded him into a better human being. It isn't just ""oh my God zombies, let's run this way!!"" (although that is present), there's some heart within the frantic action which I found to be admirable. Extremely well paced for a two hour flick, didn't get bored once. The makeup for the infected looked authentic. Plenty of blood, dark veins and a really nice touch with the grey eyes. I was on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions particularly during the chase scenes. The cinematography was clean and sharp, incredible picture quality. I did find the visual effects to be below average, especially fires or breaking of glass. CGI zombies are kept to a minimal but is unfortunately used. Also punching the infected just relinquishes the fear of them, I was no longer scared of them. However, a damn entertaining train ride.","

"radicalmuffin","15 February 2020","So, a typical Zombie movie from America has:
A badass character that does everything to save the world and side characters that help him do this things.
But Train to Busan is different. How?
Well in this movie the main character is just a normal character with a daughter trying to survive.And that's it. No main badass character, nothing.This movie shows how a real zombie outbreak could happen, how individuals could attack other individuals because of their selfishness.I could go on and on about why this movie is so great.","

"kosmasp","17 April 2017","From zombies that is. Obviously if you're not into horror and/or zombies you probably shouldn't watch this. While it does also work as a drama (some of the best horror movies do), there is a lot of blood and a lot of violence. Just putting that out there (or should it be in there?). They also made an Anime as prequel to this. And while that is good in its own right (if you don't have an aversion against animated movies), you don't have to watch it beforehand.The acting is more than decent for a movie like this, but it is really a fast paced movie, so once it starts running, there is no real slowing down. Which is also true of the zombies. So if you're a ""purist"", you may take issue with that. I personally like the slow zombies myself too. It becomes more of an action movie, when they run. Having said that, when it's done as good as it is here, I don't mind either.South Korea is good when it comes to action, so that was kind of to be expected. If you had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen, good for you. But with home cinemas evolved there is enough to take and enjoy at home too. Best watch it with friends though, to get a vibe going","

"50fiftillidideeBrain","29 May 2022","🚅2B is an exploration of what happens when a zombie infected person stumbles onto a loaded train as it leaves the station. Loads of SK features have eating front and center, but in this movie, the dining car is closed. Only the zombies get to snack.The main protag is fund📈 manager and father, Seok-woo, who is traveling with his 10 year old daughter, Soo-an. She doesn't look 10, she's small and adorable.Newly divorced, dad is taking her to visit mom.What ensues is what one can expect from a zombie thriller at 60+ full-steam-ahead mph, with cars, door, racks, & compartments everywhere.The worst issue with the film is how characters don't take charge of their own well-being. None of these people are trained to kill. They aren't all grabbing or fabricating weapons. When a couple of them discover a major weakness the zombies have, they don't even inform the others or exploit it properly! One character had rigged armour, of sorts, around his arm, to go help rescue someone else. Why he took it off is perplexing: He needed it later. It isn't surprising that individuals would be paralyzed by shock. The fact that nobody got fired up enough to take charge is hard to accept. It would have kept one car of passengers on track to save many lives. I suppose it wouldn't be a horror film if nobody 🎭 idiotic.What's also on display is the best and worst of humanity. The moral centers are the 10 year old Soo-an, a big man, and his very pregnant wife (she looks like she's 11 mos in or carrying triplets in some scenes). The embodiment of evil, conniving, self-interest is portrayed by another passenger. As his true nature doesn't raise its ugly head until midway, his portrayal shows how dire circumstances can bring out the best and worst of people. Seok-woo is claiming the middle moral ground in the beginning of the show. He intends no harm, but he's not about to get involved or inconvenience himself, either. He even stores his investors' phone numbers in a file named ""Lemmings"" on his 📱. We watch his moral journey, along with his geographic journey, during the route of the flick.It all seems typical - not bad, not great - for the first 70-75% of the film. The last portion of the movie is excellent with regards to the filming, action, special effects, and acting (Zombies go flying all over in a fantastic trainwreck - we even see a train pull a horde of zombies as more and more of them jump onto the growing blob of a pile!). Kim Su-an, who plays the kid, may not get to kill a zombie, but she slays her part. SK entertainment, in an apparent overabundance of riches, parades a steady flow of amazing child actors!All Aboard! T2B is definitely worth the trip, particularly for the excellent last stretch. It comes in at just under 2hrs, and it streaks by in no time at all. The focus is on the people, but the zombies make some 🆒 moves, too. In the final analysis, it is also a worthy primer of what not to do during a zombie apocalypse, which I daresay might come in handy someday.IMHO...

"a_chinn","12 July 2018","The highest grossing film in South Korea of all time is a routine, but well made zombie thriller. The story begins at the outset of a zombie outbreak with a father and daughter finding themselves on a train to the town of Busan, hoping to escape the zombie plague around them. Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to ""Snowpiercer,"" but ""Train to Busan"" lacks that film's smart political subtext. ""Train to Busan"" is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext. So overall, ""Train to Busan"" manages to come up with some interesting situations and set pieces and does them well, it's all pretty vapid and you'll forget most of the film an hour after you've watched it.","

"ethanbresnett","26 February 2023","Train to Busan quite rightly deserves its title as one of the best zombie films ever made.There are a few reasons why, but the main two for me are that the human stakes feel reel, and the action is executed exceptionally well.In terms of the human stakes, this is an area that zombie films get wrong time and time again. They build their film from the action up and forget to flesh out their characters. Train to Busan doesn't fall into this trap, and actually creates characters that you will care about, with meaningful character arcs. It makes for a much more engaging and rewarding experience, and really ramps up the suspense. Behind each of these characters is a great performance as well.Then there's the action, which is spot on. In any zombie film there are a lot of creative decisions to make about the zombies. How are they going to look? How will they move? How quickly will infested people turn? While there are no right or wrong answers to these questions, Train to Busan gets them all right. It makes for incredibly thrilling and creative action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat.These are the main two reasons why this film is at the peak of its genre, but there are many more (the great camera work, brilliant setting, great pacing to name a few).If you have any interest in zombie films then you must watch this film as soon as possible, as it is quite possibly the greatest zombie film ever made!","

"Tweetienator","12 September 2016","Lots of praise by other reviewers so I will play the advocatus diaboli here - Train to Busang is a good flick with fast running zombies/infected like portrait in 28 Days later etc. A couple of ppl are in a train as the outbreak hits the nation (South Korea). The fight of these survivors on the train and on some stations is the main plot, centered around a father and his little daughter and a man and his pregnant wife as the main heroes. I liked the movie - camera, acting everything is pro but the movie lost for me a lot cuz some figthing scenes were just not well executed - for example three guys fighting with baseball bats and fists their way through train wagons filled with dozens of infected. No bite, no blow, no wound, it's just simply impossible, it looks like a little bit of a Chackie Chan movie here - trained forces with guns etc. turned cuz they their overruned by the infected but our heroes just get them down with one fist-punch... If u ever had to fight with a mad guy you know what a strength such a man can execute even if you are of more strength and weight. Also the gore level is for my taste rather low - lots of blood yes, but no limbs or guts etc. flying around or flesh bitten out by hungry maniacs etc. So yes, this movie is far far better as all those wanna-be zombie flicks from pseudo-filmmakers with no talent and/or budget but can't beat the elite movies of this genre: a good movie but not in all aspects (some terrible hollow Asian drama scenes) really convincing and in no way the ""best zombie movie ever"" like some other reviewers stated.","

"davidlmarks","27 October 2016","Wow.Where do I even begin? This movie shows that Hollywood does not own the monopoly on quality film making. But checking out the quality of the entertainment of late coming from Hollywood, that's not really a stretch.All young Su-an (played by Soo-an Kim) wants for her birthday is to spend it with her mother. So her separated and unengaged father Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) attempts to fulfill her wish. Her mother lives in Busan. That's a relatively unconventional short train ride, and with some coaxing, off they go.But, of course, the train ride is anything but unconventional.News filters into passengers on the train that something horrible is affecting people, turning them into crazed rabid flash eaters. Little do they know that this is about to infect the people on the train as well.Along with Seok Woo and Su-an, there are a whole host of great secondary characters that round out the cast. Like cheerleader Ahn So-hee, reluctant boyfriend and amateur baseball player Young Gook (and the rest of the team), Sang Hwa, a linebacker or sumo wrestler or just a plain bad-ass, and his expectant wife Sung Gyeong. Do NOT mess with this man's wife and child! The train is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse showdown. The train can not stop at stations because they are all over-run by the hordes, and the living passengers are continually being squeezed into tighter and tighter quarters by the increasing number of swarming undead that move like World War Z zombies-on-meth.Train to Busan is one of the best zombie action flicks I've seen in a long time. Director Sang-ho Yeon does an amazing job with pacing, the acting is top notch, and the screenplay (also written by Sang-ho Yeon) is visceral and touching.Highly highly recommend!","

Let speculators like Guo Xiaozi, Deng Chao and articles learn how to make a good film without too many paragraphs, special effects and gimmicks. In terms of shortcomings, Man 1 has a dull expression (as if it was only at the end) and fails to find a new bright spot in the zombie convention.","

It did bring tears to my eyes to watch the little girl cry realizing the fate of his father. I really enjoyed the fast pace of this movie like you don't have time to catch your breath once the action starts. I also like the character development although It would have been good to know more about the reason behind the outbreak besides saying a leak in the chemical plant.A well fitted ending which I appreciate, I wasn't sure where the movie was going to end. The girl singing that song for his father was also a nice touch. The movie was so good the 2 hours just went by and I wanted the movie to keep going.

"bear_adam","8 November 2016","OMG I just got out from watching what I believe to be the Greatest Zombie Film Ever Created. I will explain why I feel this way lol. I have seen a ton of Zombie films since ""Night of the Living Dead"" all the way to ""World War Z"" and in-between. My favorites up until this point were ""28 Days Later"" and the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and being the horror movie buff that I'm I take pride in knowing I have seen a lot of movies. I will now start my review. The story is about a man who is taking his daughter to see her mom on a train when a virus breaks out all over South Korea. The premise is simple which makes the movie that much more agreeable. The acting was honestly great with the three main leads played by Yoo Gong who plays the father Seok Woo as well as the daughter played by Soo-an Kim and finally the heavy hitter Dong-seok Ma who has almost as much screen time as the father. The other actors did fantastic as well. The action is where this movie shines. I mean it was honestly as if ""28 days later"" and ""World War Z"" had a baby set in the Snowpiercer setting. The action was visceral and exhilarating. The zombie effects were top-notch and the blood was not too chaotic to the point of being unrealistic mind you this is a zombie film. The action was the Star in this film just to be clear with many scenes from ""Snowpiercer"" and ""World War Z"" being displayed here but what is used in better fashion in my opinion. The cinematography was Excellent and every scene both in the build-up scenes and the mayhem were shot with perfection. I didn't notice one hitch. The location they filmed in was Superb. I will close by saying that I may be biased and love Korean films ever since ""Oldboy"" released but please don't let you not liking to read subtitles be the reason that you miss such a monumental film in the zombie genre pass you by so to speak. The director Sang-ho Yeon deserves an Oscar for his directing of this Breathtaking Masterpiece. The film is also at times very emotional and heartbreaking but it has some of the slickest fight scenes in a zombie film to date.","

"TdSmth5","15 August 2017","A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.I can't quite understand the high score of this movie. It is perfectly mediocre and stands out in no way whatsoever.","

It is a movie of how people struggle trough surviving conditions, which have never faced before, how they choose between morals and how egoistic they can become. It is train of thoughts, train of emotions, train of support and self-sacrifice, facing demons of own.","

"chilligrrl","26 October 2019","I put this off deliberately as i just went on a trip to Korea 3 weeks ago and took the train to Busan from Seoul. I wouldn't have put one foot on a train if i'd watched it first, and would have been on the lookout for zombies the whole time. Kudos to KORAIL for putting their name all over this movie though, my local railway sure wouldn't.It was interesting, horrifying, corny, brilliant.... everything all squished into one train. I feel for the little girl though, and her father when he finally did what he did at the movie end. Watch this, but not just before you vacation in Korea, seriously.","

"jamesvass-62316","8 March 2021","A movie about a distant father and his daughter who board a train along with a collection of other interesting characters all bound for Busan Meanwhile a zombie apocalypse is fast taking hold across the country. An infected passenger does the rest... Watching this movie, I couldn't help but draw visual comparisons to the type of infection seen in World War Z. There are indeed comparable stories in both movies, in the extended version of WWZ there is a strong Korean storyline suggesting that the infection could have originated somewhere in Korea. In TTB, the characters take centre stage and the apocalypse storyline has been compressed into this moving train. The characters are a clear representation of the best and worst of humanity and it's interesting to see them interact with their situations. It's almost like watching a case study on a zombie apocalypse... I wasn't a fan of the fate of some of the characters and the last minute death of the father seemed pointless but maybe my strong reaction was the intended reaction? Either way it's another cool Korean picture.","

The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse.

"cherold","24 April 2019","After telling my girlfriend that Train to Busan was an amazing movie, I found I couldn't quite tell her why. It doesn't really have any of those moments you talk about after or anything; it's a movie that's simply really engrossing and exciting on a minute-by-minute basis rather than one with amazing set pieces.It starts slowly, setting up a bunch of characters in a way that reminds me of 70s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure. A neglectful father and his young daughter, a couple of middle-aged ladies, a bunch of school kids, all taking a train trip. Then there's a sick passenger who comes back from the dead and suddenly a zombie virus is tearing through the train like wildfire.Trapped on a moving train, and seeing the outside world is also in the grip of zombies, a shrinking set of passengers fights for survival, beset by zombies as well as the worst of human nature.The movie is beautifully structured. There is a lovely compactness to the way characters are introduced; you quickly have a sense of who they are and become invested. The pace is fast and disasters come on on another like dominoes.It's not too gory, which is how I like my horror. It's really closer to something like The Birds or Jurassic Park, and is as much action and suspense as horror. You should watch it.","

It has refreshed the zombie movement, something that hasn't happened since the 28 Days Later film franchise.I really can not recommend this film enough.It is action packed and the acting is flawless.You become very attached to the core characters, and it makes you really wonder how you would cope being put in this kind of situation.If you love zombies, please give this a go.

"851222","1 May 2017","Greetings from Lithuania.""Train to Busan"" (2016) was hands down the most involving, intriguing, nail biting and visceral experience I've seen in many moons, considering this so called ""zombie"" genre. It has more in common with ""28 Days Later"" then G. Romero zombies and even ""World War Z"" influence is pretty obvious. But ""Train to Busan"" was by a moon better then ""World War Z"" - at running time 1 h 50 min. I wished it didn't ended and that happens rarely in movies these days.This is a superbly crafted picture from start till finish. The first ~50 min where nothing short of spectacular - great special effects, superbly constructed action / chase set piece at the station, clear character development and very clear and involving narrative. Second part of the film was just great - a nail biting horror / thriller.Overall, if you do like zombie movies - ""Train to Busan"" delivers goods - big time. This is one of the best if not the best example in this genre in some long time. I want a sequel.","

"HorrorFanatic4Life","15 April 2020","Although zombies typically had been slow in the past with them being the ""buried dead"", etc., you have to admit that zombies have evolved in movies so much since the '80s. What movie would be this intense with zombies that you could easily outwalk?! With that being said, these were pretty frightening and that's saying a lot considering there wasn't much gore to go along with it. The special effects weren't too over the top and there were plenty of pretty realistic bits to everything. In comparison I would say these zombies are similar to ones in World War Z or 28 Weeks Later.The difference between this movie and those other 2 is that this storyline is much better. There wasn't some special person on a special mission or anything extravagant. It was a normal dad and his daughter as well as other seemingly normal people going on a normal train ride that ends up being far from normal. Although no character was super special, it was still action packed and as realistic as you can get with zombie movies. To me that's what made it so amazing. Bonus points for actually killing off a main character since that usually never happens!There is also something to be said about the little girl. She was phenomenal for being so young and added so much to the movie. I didn't expect a movie like this to be so emotional, but she sure made it that way with several scenes. More notably when her dad got bit. That was a tough scene to watch because her emotions felt so real.All the other actors were great as well! I don't believe there was a single one that really sucked. Although there isn't much background with every secondary character, you still gather enough information about who they are as people as things progress. This helped with the very intense scenes where one would die off.I don't watch many Korean movies, or many other foreign films for that matter, but this has me wanting to watch more. The only difficult part was having to read subtitles and possibly missed some stuff by doing so, but there was so much other good to this movie that I didn't care in the end. Even for it being a pretty lengthy movie, which is usually a huge turnoff for me. Surprisingly I kept up from start to finish!An issue I noticed that was different than others was that there didn't seem to be a certain timeframe that one would turn rabid once they got bit. It seemed to vary depending on who got bit and where we were in the movie. It could be more intense that way considering you don't know when it will happen. Or it could be a bit of a plot whole. Just depends on how you look at it. There was also a little inconsistency with breaking glass being that sometimes they could break through and other times they couldn't although the glass is all the same.Another weird/confusing bit was when they went through tunnels and the zombies all of a sudden couldn't see. When that happened the zombies literally went mute pretty much and stopped attacking. But they could hear things still. The only problem I had with that is they made a point to say that they got angry when they saw the characters still alive. So do they get angry off seeing them? Or is it the noises the people make?? It seemed to be a little weird to have that part in there and didn't make much sense to me watching it play out.Besides those few negatives, this movie still had so much else to offer. I would still recommend to anyone that's into zombie-type moves. Really glad I stumbled upon it!","

"ninchnails-44276","20 November 2021","This really is an awesome zombie flick. And what's even better, it seems to be on all the best free movie app's (Tubi, Pluto, Peacock, At the very least), and has been for months. Considering it's similarities, I'd call this a far superior version of World War Z, which was pretty much a disappointment.The acting was all top-notch, THANKfully, because that seems to be where so many horror movies fail the last 20 years or so.. There's just such a plethora of horror movies that have come out since 2000 that aren't just b-movie quality and low budget, but the acting is just AWFUL. And that's what I don't understand... Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead were made on shoestring budgets with all local Pitt actors and friends of the director, respectively, yet the acting was on par with most any other horror film of the time... So why, these days, are the low-budgets so terrible? Does the directing have THAT much of an effect on the actors' abilities? Or have the b-list actors really become THAT terrible?But I digress... There was literally only TWO things that KIND OF irritated me about the movie... no spoilers... First, there was too much STARING. You'll find yourself either screaming in your mind or actually screaming at the screen for whichever character TO DO SOMETHING! So instead of taking action and doing something in the best interest of survival, they'll just be standing there, staring at whatever threat for WAAAAY too long. Second, just like in a lot of horror or action movies, there's that one scumbag that really deserves to get it, and you look so forward to seeing it happen... and normally, the more scumbaggery they commit, the so much better you know it's going to be... Well, that's half right in this case... All I'll say is this turd really just keeps adding to your apathy towards him by constantly making choices that make you wanna smash his face in. And when the time comes, he... well, suffice it to say, I was extremely let down... like watching the entire 6 hours of the movie Gettysburg and the DVD showing the error screen right before the ending.Regardless, this movie is EXCELLENT. This and Night Eats the World are the two best SERIOUS zombie films in a very long time. Makes great use of tension throughout, and has plenty of moments that make you jump, not really from scares but more from little shocks. Very well done character building, bc you're either shocked or very bummed out when certain characters bite it. Check it out, you won't regret it.Side note: If anyone is looking for GREAT new horror movies, I STRONGLY suggest...
Host, Terrified (Spanish), Veronica (Spanish), Life After Beth, Braid (one of THE GREATEST, MOST ARTISTICALLY BEAUTIFUL endings of all time), Horsegirl, Kuso (AMAZINGLY warped), Let's Scare Julie, and Skins (Spanish, another wickedly bizarre and brilliant film)... Host is only 60 minutes but it's probably the only film that ever actually scared me for over 3/4 of it. I promise, you will really dig these if you love true horror, not mainstream trash.","

"Uriah43","9 September 2017","""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average.","

During this time there is ""a small leak at the plant"" which leads to the proverbial zombie outbreak and of course one gets on the train to create havoc for the film.The film is a bit heavy. It is about family, sharing, and sacrifice...things Seok Woo placed second to himself. He now must work as a team and learn different values to save his daughter. The film becomes a bitter-sweet zombie drama before it is all over. Almost 2 hours long and needs about 10-15 minutes cut from it.Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing in the English subtitles, but I think there was some in Korean not translated.","

People that are old enough to think should relate to the drama part easily and the message it's passing.The final 15 minutes was really emotional, and I didn't expect it to be so pronounced because I already got the ""message"" throughout the entire film before the last bite started. The movie would still be good even without the last part, and probably more balanced emotionally.","

"shanayneigh","11 June 2017","The movie itself was pretty good. It felt almost like an old Irwin Allen disaster movie like The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure, with disparate groups of people being confined to a location or set piece where they have to confront and overcome adversity.But what stood out most to me was the performance by Kim Su-an who played the little girl Soo-an. In my view, the Korean acting style can at times be a bit theatrical or melodramatic. But not one beat of Kim Su-an's performance felt false. It was dramatic and emotional without crossing the line into melodrama or schmaltz. Very impressive for an actress who must have been around 9-10 years old or so when the movie was produced.","

"FilmSchoolFlunk","16 August 2023","I gotta say, this is a phenomenal zombie film. The undead are erratic and horrifying, the train setting is claustrophobic, the movie has some seriously effective emotional beats and the characters are extremely likeable. The train is a genius setting, splitting the populous into groups of living and undead amongst the vehicle. It provided unique and memorable challenges and situations for our characters to get through. I was shocked and thoroughly impressed with the moments this film got a tear or two out of me, and it owes this primarily to its characters. More than once I felt moved by the passing of an individual, and our protagonists arc feels substantial and rewarding. The manner in which our key cast sacrifices themselves for the longevity of the others is brutal, yet beautiful, and says a lot about human love and motivation. The selfish characters die scared and lonely in the end, and the characters who survived only do so because of others' sacrifices. I love how this film held nothing back, no corny ending where we can have our cake and eat it too, its incredibly bittersweet, as I felt the weight of what was necessary for these character to live.","

Bitting my nails at every turn. Heart thumping through each scene. There's not a single boring moment in this accelewerating 2h film.Gong Yoo is just absolutely incrtedible portaing a father (Seok-woo) that barely has any time for his young daughter Kim Su-an (Soon-an). Together the take the train towards Busan where Soo-an's mother is waiting for her. Nothing prepared them for the train ride of their lives. He'll just about do anything to save her and she realises that he became at last the father she always wanted.A regret? It last only 2h and you'll have to see the end to know the 2nd.","

"themadmovieman","7 September 2017","In what is easily the best zombie movie in recent years, Train To Busan proves an enormously entertaining watch at every minute, featuring twists and turns galore to the backdrop of an intensely action-packed battle for survival, yet still with an incredible amount of emotion and heart, thanks to some very well-developed characters and strong performances throughout.There's a lot to love about this movie, but I'm going to start off with why it makes the zombie genre, one that often falls flat, really work. For me, zombie movies are regularly frustrating watches, proving to be nothing more than two hours of running away from a mass of mildly threatening things, and never really allowing for anything different to spark genuine interest or excitement.Fortunately, what Train To Busan does is keep the simplest and most effective characteristics of the zombie genre, but make sure that it never loses sight of what makes a good film. As a result, while there's so much fantastic zombie action, and some properly intense violence that makes the undead far more threatening villains than normal, it's the film's story that really makes it work so well.Above all, the depth of character development is the biggest success of the whole film. Starting off with a concise and interesting introduction to our main characters, looking at a father obsessed with his work and how that has alienated his own daughter, the film doesn't languish about when it comes to being more thorough, but the background that it does give you is absolutely vital for the rest of the film.Following on from the father and daughter, we're introduced just as efficiently to a couple of other major characters on the train that will be integral to the fight for survival, and it's the fact that get a genuine emotional insight into each of them that means you can really fear for them in this situation, and will them to survive against what seem like impossible odds.Throughout, the film proves itself bold and daring by making sure no major characters are 100% safe, and that means you're sitting on an emotional knife-edge at every moment. It's not the action and pace that makes this film a thrilling watch, but the fact that you're so enthralled in the story, and each and every turn proves yet another incredible twist.The performances in this film are also just as strong. The excellent character development is matched by a selection of both likable and brilliantly dastardly performances across the board, and although that doesn't always excuse the occasional stupid character decision to advance the plot, it reinforces your emotional connection to the leads, and with the likes of Gong Yoo and Ma Dong-seok in particular putting in fantastic turns, you won't be able to look away from the movie's fantastic heroes.And finally, I can't forget to say that this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Its drama may be enthralling, and its emotion powerful, but it's still a playful and hyperbolic zombie movie that will put as much of a smile on your face as put you on the edge of your seat. It's not a downbeat, apocalyptic disaster movie like World War Z or so many Hollywood zombie flicks, but rather a vivacious and rapid-fire blockbuster full of life and humour to go along with its excellent story.Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by Train To Busan. An incredibly entertaining movie that outdoes almost every zombie movie before it, it impresses with excellent performances and directing, and a story that prioritises enthralling characters and genuine drama over simple thrills and spills, but still leaves time for a load of great zombie action.","

"TYContact1","31 August 2018","Some of my favourites are 28 Days Later, Zombieland, and A Girl with all the gifts: I prefer memorable characters, action scenes, dialogues, introspection about humanity, suspense, and dark humour over gory jump scares.This movie, albeit predictable plot lines and character stereotypes, the actors and pace engage the viewer to root for their (good & ill) fates. Characters' actions mostly remained convincing: their behaviour is driven by consistent, reasonable motive, and some characters transformed through meaningful incidents naturally, not in a sudden to fit the ending. Each survivor is well acted.Camera work was effective in portraying a sense of dread and chaos, while keeping focus on the main characters and plots moving along the train corridors. At 2 hours in length, there wasn't much dragging scenes at all. I just skipped the character intro (10 minutes), and from then on, the story runs along. How realistic is the ending depends on the viewer: are you an optomist or a pessimist? Either way, it's 2 hours well spent.The 15 minute behind the scenes bonus feature actors and production crew rehearsing, teasing each other, including bloopers, quite a strange shift in mood :)","

"steamboatwillie1928","27 March 2017","I have to say that we generally avoid movies with sub-titles and Asian films. We want to watch the movie, not read the sub-titles and most Asian films do not make sense to me because of the cultural differences. Train to Busan had both these as strikes against it, yet for some reason, we decided to give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it and have another selection going in short time. Boy were we wrong!! About fifteen minutes into the movie, the main characters had been introduced, the stage set and the roller-coaster started heading down the first hill. And a roller-coaster ride it was. We were on the edge of our seats: anxious, happy, sad, shocked, the full gamut of emotions.This is a zombie film, but it is an intelligent zombie film. The director does not resort to cheap gags and scenes that all of the zombie films now-a-days fall prey to. In many respects, it reminded me of World War Z and very well could have occurred in the same universe.Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job with direction. He gave the film depth and subtle levels.Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim, who play the father and daughter respectively, were so believable in their roles. The majority of the cast deserve praise for their work: you hate who you should hate, you like who you should like you change opinions about the ones you should change your minds about. But it does go beyond the simple classification of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"".Whether you like zombie movies or just a good ""who lives, who dies"" film, give this little gem a shot. You will be surprised.","

"thesar-2","2 October 2016","While these aren't the zombies I'm looking for, the movie made up for every wrong-doing in World War Z.Train to Busan is an incredibly well-shot, well-acted and well-thought- out zombie/infected film with characters you care about, want to see grow and live. It might have had a low budget, but you'd never know it; this foreign film looked like a major Hollywood movie.Now, though the many scenes of heart, exposition, depth, setup and introduction to our ""heroes"" worked really well, the movie was terribly too long. I wasn't really complaining throughout for pacing or length, nor was I wondering if scenes could be cut, but it still went on far longer than it should have. It was almost as if there were 5-6 climaxes and then you realize you still have 45-25 minutes left.Also, and this is a personal preference, the zombies ran at Mach One speed. Sincerely, I love zombie shows and I'm a purist at heart. The slow, stumbling, ""yes, you can walk right past them"" kinds are what frighten me the most. The exception to the rule was 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake. They were fast, fine, but the movie's all-around greatness made me forget my hang-up on the bionic-beasts.And Train to Busan did the same thing. There was so much good here, the zombies were pretty much incidental to everything else I liked. Basically a divorced and selfish dad agrees to take his daughter to see her mom on a train when the 77,493th zombie-apocalypse begins. (That's not a complaint to how many there are, just a semi-fact. Still love this subgenre!) Unfortunately for the passengers, an infected, bitten, Walker, The Living Dead or Zombie – pick your poison, gets on board and all hell breaks loose. Unlike most of the Z movies, you will see characters grow and scenes so powerful, it'd be hard not to choke up. I certainly did. And though the film's not without the standard clichés and stereotypical evil/not-evil scared humans, it's easy to also get past those movie tropes since the actors are so strong and believable.I really, really did like this movie. If you're a fan of zombie flicks and require a lot more depth and sometimes humor, you cannot go wrong here.***Final thoughts: Day 2 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I've heard good things about. I actually put it off too long just to save for October. Wish I hadn't; not only was the movie great, it had some incredibly cute Asian men that I wouldn't mind finding more films with them in it.","

But for those who can't see, there is no better option than to see a great zombie.No other director has ever tried to make a zombie movie in such a good way.The film is also a great emotional drama.The director deserves much praise for making everything that fills the minds of the audience and captivates them.","

"cjonesas","11 March 2022","A movie that starts good, continues great and ends lamentably bad and unclimaxed. Along the way, you get to see and experience big heroism and huge selfishness & cowardice. The latter was so immense that you wish the character and poor human being never existed, while one simple yet selfless character sacrificed himself to save the father, daughter and pregnant lady...Unfortunately, all the ""suspense"" that the director managed to build, with awesome VFX along the way gets diluted in the Korean taste for emotional and sacrificial moments (in the end) and on top of that the last act leads to a just ""happy"", cliched and illogical ending.When they give you order to shoot, you shoot!Not wanting the two survivors to die, it's just that the soldier's finger was not a true soldier's trigger finger and that loud singing just came out of nowhere for the sake of happy drama.Also, the thrill and horror factors were so so and weakened by the emotional moments completed with stupid zombies behavior in the dark.All in all, well-made and enjoyable but not a breakthrough, mainly because of the last 20 minutes or so.Screenplay/story: 7.5Development: 8.5Realism: 8.5Entertainment: 8.5Acting: 8.5Filming/cinematography: 9Visual/special effects: 9.4Music/score: 7.5Depth: 8Logic: 6Flow: 8.5Thrill/horror: 7Ending/closure: 6.","

"janey_villamater","10 September 2016","Whenever I watch movies in the theater, I almost always choose one which is either on IMAX or 3D. My reason is that, Since I am spending my hard earned money to watch a movie on the big screen, it might as well be worth it or I'd rather wait for it on DVD or watch it online. Aside from that, since there have been a lot of awesome TV shows lately, which are written with more cliffhangers, I found that whenever I watch a 2D movie in the cold and comfy theater, I get sleepy and sometimes fall asleep before the end. Blame it on my short attention I guess. The other day I was at the mall and sort of got stranded because of a sudden downpour. And I decided to pass the time by watching a movie. I tried out the Director's Club theater at the new S. Maison beside the Conrad Hotel,and I ofted to watch the Korean movie ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" because of the nice trailer that I saw on my Facebook feeds. I'll be honest, that at first I thought it was a bad decision, because I didn't know that the movie was not in English, and I thought that I would definitely fall asleep because I was so comfy in the cold temperature and lazy boy seats. But the movie was so THRILLING and ENGAGING that I was thoroughly entertained until the end, even though it was Korean and only English subtitles. Zombie plots in shows have been so common lately that I have lost interest in watching shows with zombies themes, such as ""The Walking Dead"" which was okay the first few seasons, but I feel was later on just been too violent and worn out.This movie, ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" was a surprisingly fresh and pleasant to watch. I was thrilled and engaged in it until the ending. I recommend watching it, even if I rarely don't do movie reviews or movie recommendations. For me it was definitely money well spent. So much so, that I am thankful that I got stranded in the mall that day. the all actors and actress are good! good job to the script writers and directors and staffs,.. I LIKE IT!! THE BEST FOR ME!!","

The characters do completely stupid stuff like wait for ages, staring before they take any action like run away or block doors.Punching zombies in the teeth with bare fists seems to be a winning idea & some zombies die by simply throwing them a few feet.From about 30 minutes in, every 10 or so minutes involves a scene where a protective door is shut JUST at the last minute.The way the film ends is so annoying, considering you've just sat there and watched pretty much the same thing over and over for 2 hours.","

Now up to today I'd considered zombie movies unwatchable, but Train to Busan changed all that, though I am not expecting to make it a habit. This is all class, pure quality in all departments, though I'd have to say that casting and direction were standouts. Pacing is delightfully irregular, which adds so much to such a frenetic subject, with gentle poignant moments scored with pensive piano....who'd have thought in a zombie flick. Long live K-screen.","

"vivianla","20 August 2020","Dad is divorced and argues a bit with his ex on the phone. A little girl who is so cute and I love her perfect adorable voice wants to go to mom's for her birthday. Dad got her a gift she already has. The girl lives with her dad and grandma.The two of them board the train and we see various stereotypical types of people - the jocks, the cheerleader, the elderly sisters, the hurrying man in a suit, the conductor, stewards, etc.The girl from Wonder Girls comes on the train to the pleasant excitement of the boys in their baseball jackets and bats. She sits next to one of them.The little girl is innocent and does what is morally correct. Dad tells her that in these situations it's every man for himself but she still wants to be the nice girl. The little girl associates with the other passengers notably the pregnant woman and her husband and the two elderly women who she gives a seat to.The man points at his wife's belly and says, ""I made that."". His wife gives him a look and he says it is true.Information is scattered, no one really knows what is really going on and the government isn't informing in detail. It is literally Darwin's theory about whomever is competent survives. Physical strength, quick running, attention is all tested in fighting and running from the zombies and not being bitten by one.The little main group comprises of Gong Yoo and his daughter, one elderly sister, the pregnant woman and her husband, and the cheerleader's crush. I love this group but they die off one by one, turning into zombies. We see a selfish man, the hurrying one who only cares about himself convince the crowd to block the door for our main group. The other elderly sister looks at her poor sister who has turned into a zombie and opens the door, letting the zombies bite everyone.The train track is blocked from a fallen train and fire. Gong Yoo, pregnant woman and the little girl escape on to another train. Gong Yoo is bitten by the selfish man and lets himself fall off the back of the train. The woman and girl walk through a tunnel where the military wait at the other end to see who comes through.","

"Vivekmaru45","15 April 2017","After having watched the superb film World War Z(2013), I was eager to watch more of the same. Years later I got a chance to see Train To Busan. The quality of the film matches World War Z in every respect. Train To Busan has a different setting to World War Z.The film is shot at a train station. Therefore all the action scenes are set inside and around trains. If you like films that are set on trains then you'll like this film. Examples are Murder on the Orient Express(1974), Narrow Margin(1990), Under Siege 2: Dark Territory(1995), Unstoppable(2010).The supporting cast is superb. Gong Yoo plays the central character of the film alongside a host of gifted actors. Ma Dong-seok is another talented actor. Kim Su-an does a wonderful performance as a child-actress.Note that this is a graphic horror film with intense scenes of gore. People who are new to this genre should perhaps see the trailer to the film before watching this one.There is a companion animated feature film to Train To Busan: Seoul Station, also directed by Sang-ho, was released less than a month later after the main film.Want to see more Zombie films? The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue(1974), Shock Waves (1977), Dawn of the Dead (1978), Zombie(1979), Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror(1981), Re-Animator (1985). C.H.U.D.(1984), C.H.U.D.

This only made the humane moments stand out more. Ma Dong Seok and Gong Yoo's character arcs had the perfect set up and emotionally PAYED OFF. Every performance was on point! You could just see the fear portrayed in detail on everyones faces. Even the extras! Every dialogue flowed naturally and realistically. The zombies physical movements and make up were so believable and executed well! All of this only added to the fear and panic instilled on viewers and portrayed to perfection by all the characters on screen. It was brilliant writing-wise, the way every character had such diverse characters with different perspectives, arcs, motivations, and belief systems all intertwined and played out like a domino effect. Massive tear jerkers, in a good way. I was sobbing so much near the end. Solid Film!This movie showcases human nature so accurately.","

Regularly people, living their lives, suddenly faced with terror and death. But where Night of the Living Dead is a slow-burn thriller, this is an edge-of-your-seat action-horror whirlwind. The performances are fantastic, and the final 15 minutes is unexpectedly moving. A little long and sporadically hacky? Maybebut it's mostly just a cool and scary ride.","

"fikamugg","9 April 2017","If Hollywood ever decides to remake this title my advice to the audience is clear: DON'T BOTHER! It has been a while since i saw a really good movie. A movie that can compete for the 20 best or so list but Train to Busan not only made me smile it also impressed me on many levels. It's without a doubt the best modern zombie movie since 28 days later. The story and the script are well crafted and the characters are likable just like in 28 days later and The zombies are running, thank god.7 seasons with the walking dead has not only nearly bored me to death it has also made me realize how important it is that zombies in a zombie flick are really frightening and not some stupid dead meat you can whack half sleeping. The zombies and the effects in Train to Busan have the touch of a major studio production, which in itself of course is not a guarantee for success. Who doesn't remember the miserable effects in I am legend? Also 28 days later did not have a particularly big budget but succeeded anyway, so its not about the money, rather the quality, and the quality in TTB is top notch. The zombie-crowd scenes for instance feels more believable and well made compared with World War Z even though the comparison is not 100% since the zombie crowd-scenes in WWZ were massively crowded.The only minus comes with the choice of a train as the center piece of the story. On the surface TTB shows similarities with a movie like Flight of the living dead. But the zombies on a plane - zombies on a train duality is just a play with words. The comparison of the two films is unfair. With splendid actors and a far more interesting story TTB has ambitions other than to make you laugh. Despite the unsexy choice of playground TTB is running for 1.57 and you won't even notice. Just another sign of how good this bad-ass Korean zombie film is.","

"Weirdling_Wolf","9 December 2020","Director, Yeon Sang-Ho's almost absurdly locomotive 'Train to Busan' might well be the only apocalyptic zombie action-fest to be openly inspired by Charles Dickens's immortal Christmas parable 'Scrooge'! The doom-laden drama begins immediately after an allegedly benign chemical spill, along with massive civil unrest increasing exponentially there are wild & woolly reports of rioting across the country, and as the societal collapse swiftly spreads, various amusingly stock characters board the last train to darksvillle, along with one recently infected soul, who proceeds with laudable alacrity to scurrilously spread this especially vicious, bloodily viscous, universally eye-bleaching, zombie-making contagion! Unthinkingly aggressive, pack-like, dangerously nimble, this ferociously fleet-footed legion of relentlessly single-minded, flesh-craving savages makes for an especially unruly morass of terminally toxic humanity, and it will take all the available brawn, guile and collective humanity of our hastily organised zombie-resistance squad. A boisterous teenaged baseball team, an especially muscle-bound, Bolo Yeung-esque pugilist and his bulbously pregnant wife, a deliciously despotic, self-serving C.E.O, two immaculate, sit-com ready, octogenarian ladies plus the glacially aloof, hedge fund-manipulating estranged father of an implausibly cute, 'Spielbergian kid' desperately stave off this hellacious horde of hastily reanimated death, as their terror-beleaguered train wends its tumultuous 453 km journey to the hoped-for sanctuary of far flung, Busan. While the flighty film's non-stop, claustrophobic hysteria is frequently distracting, there's a singular sentimentality which felt incongruent; especially the existential, Dickensian emancipation of our handsome, young, estranged father protagonist, dramatically turning from callous, money-hungry 'Scrooge' to empathic, zombie-slaying super-dad! Another niggling irritant was the inevitable repetition of frequently frantic, door-fumblingly, 'oh-so narrow' escapes by our preternaturally plucky, carriage-bound protagonists, but, curiously, while only running at a lean 113 minutes, this celluloid exodus dragged on a wee bit, and could have richly benefited from some judicious editing, excising much of the saccharine sentimentality and enlivening the rather pedestrian script with additional fright-leavening flourishes of zesty repartee would have sped things along nicely, as more than once I could hear myself wearily ask the overwrought driver, 'are we were there yet?' 'Train to Busan' is a mixed bag o' rotten bones, while extraordinarily polished and well made, its momentary lapses of déjà vu, the timorous lack of practical gore FX and the film's grisly excesses of Spielbergian soul searching, perhaps, making this particular zombie apocalypse far more suitable entertainment for mainstream audiences than jaded, hardcore horror fans like me!","

"saeedahmedsasoli","29 November 2020","A very realistic portrayal of human emotion, human actions and scary as any nightmare, this film blows modern day zombie attempts right out of the water. Anyone wanting to make a zombie film should watch this for reference, rather than following the tired and overdone ridiculousness of boobs, sex and stupid people acting stupid, making stupid decisions and deserving to die.I find movies set in a running train intriguing. The aerial scenes were very well shot. The cinematography is spectacular n the editing crispy. The film is loaded with tension n mayhem throughout. The best character is the husband of the pregnant woman. One helluva selfless fella.This is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, 10/10.","

"philipposathina","22 November 2018","Actually a very good one in both categories. Korean cinema has given some very good movies in the past -starting from the excellent ""old boy""- and has already been recognised as an asset in movie industry, so it would be rather foolish to undervalue its films as coming from a country far too remote, far too culturally different, far too unknown to pay some attention to its productions.
I started watching this film with no prejudice but also not been sure of the quality of what i was to watch. Right from the begining it was apparent that it was a serious production and not at all a cheap cartoon style film from a ""third"" country. And so it proved to be till its very end: A very well made zombie/horror film and not at all only. Through the story line and using the zombie issue as an excuse and cause, there was a very clear and interesting effort to point out the contrast of ""good"" and ""evil"" in human nature, and that is among living humans themselves. You add to this the really tender family drama unfolding along a very well and quite realistically made adventure and you have a film which captures your attention from the very beginning and finally leaves you very moved and in tears.
Last but not least: The excellent acting -the little girl will break your heart especially in the final scene- and the amazing, musically simple yet really imposing, epic music score in the ending credits.
Do watch it, worths every penny of it!","

It's plot is weak and has tons of holes, acting was weak, direction was focused more on the aesthetics of the shots rather than story telling. It's comparable to Resident Evil series... actually, I think Resident Evil series is much better.The main character is supposed to be changing from selfish in the beginning to caring for others towards the end. But the main actor played the ""good guy"" from the beginning and the contrast wasn't apparent. He destroyed what could've been a great character to play.Overall, this was one of the worst of 2016.

If you are looking to be entertained, or better yet, if you are one of those people who like horror movies mixed in with the sub mediocre comedy, like the 'Scary Movie' types, only then do I recommend this.I basically laughed out so loudly throughout most of this movie. The acting was so hilarious and overdone and painfully forced. The behaviour of the 'zombies' was unpredictable because sometimes when the plot wanted it they could walk only slowly, sometimes run away like athletes with ghoulishly done faces, and sometimes just look too lost, it almost felt they were sympathetic of the main characters sad life. I cried laughing. I love horror movies, but this is not a good portrayal of one.","

"amesmonde","28 February 2017","A group of terrified passengers fight their way through a viral outbreak while trapped on a bullet train ride to Busan.Train to Busan is a blood-drenched South Korean zombie/virus horror, director Yeon Sang-ho and writer Park Joo-suk offer a serious zombie apocalypse yarn. Interestingly most of the bloody, milky eyed and black vein thrilled story is set in the daytime. Joo-suk offers a novel take on the infected, which cannot see in the dark, this makes for some interesting viewing during the more tense scenes especially as the train travels through darkened tunnels.Sang-ho's twitchy infected are a fast moving reminiscent of 28 Days Later and WWZ at one point there are piles of clambering dead hanging from the locomotive. In addition, this is a decent looking film, not a straight to video, DTV offering, the production values are high and the special effects are impressive. The locations are grounded which adds to the tension and you buy into the characters plight along with the punchy surprise deaths synonymous with the genre. With mistrust between the players there's a social commentary about the division of class and its pecking order, its only apt it's set on a train. There are some action packed segments in stations and some subtler moments in tunnels and the city as the survivors encounter the army and contaminated. Surprisingly there's plenty of emotion especially between workaholic Seok-woo played by Gong Yoo and his young daughter, Soo- an, delightfully played by Kim Su-an who wants to see her mother. Notable is Ma Dong-seok who plays Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man. Dong-seok delivers some memorable zombie head bashing moments. Sang-ho balances the intense infected action and drama perfectly. Highly recommended virus film.","

"Left_Hand_of_Dog","14 July 2021","Over the last 20 years or so, zombies have been terribly overdone in the movie world. I'm pretty tired of them, frankly, so when I find a newer film that works well in this flesh-hungry context, I know something special is going on. Leave it to the Koreans, I suppose, those vanguards of horror cinema, to do things just right.Tonally, Train to Busan is not scary. Let's get that straight. Instead, it rides a line between tension, explosivity, and comedy, doing service to all three. The story follows a father who takes his daughter to see mom in another city. A zombie apocalypse occurs in the surrounding world, which infects the train, and a widening cast of characters must do what they can to survive. Engage action thrusters!Right off the bat, as evidenced by the trailer, the movie looks great. This is a quality production. Whether we're seeing a locked down camera for dramatic character scenes, or engaging in wild carnage, the shots, camera movement and the editing are, in a word, perfect. This is not a small point, either. Action movies are frequently a mess if the direction is poor, and an overreliance of quick cuts is used as a smokescreen for a lack of talent. It's an easy target, but any Transformers film is a great example. The action is terrible for many reasons, not least of which is that all sense of orientation is lost in the chaos of edits. For action to work, you need to know where you stand, where things are in relation to things. It sounds simple, and you'd think it would be, but it's amazing how often it goes wrong. You could also look at the last few Die Hard movies for contradistinction, although I wouldn't recommend it.There are two things in particular that make this movie work, beyond the technically excellent action filmmaking. The first is a devotion to character, manifested in the entirety of Train to Busan's excellent cast. Each player on this kinetic, blood-drenched stage is defined by subtle relationships, whether it be to their child/parent, wife, sister, or boyfriend/girlfriend. These connections are never overstated, as the script does not dive into needless expository elements. Instead, you understand their dimensions right off the bat, and therefore everyone's motivations are clear, and each character is immediately believable and thoroughly humanized, even if they're all essentially just archetypes. This is all to say that the film does a nimble job of introducing and exploring relatable, likeable people. Big check mark.The other lovely thing about this film is its pure kinetical motion, underscored by a love for B-movie splatter. Train to Busan is almost comedically bloody in the best possible sense, as zombies munch humans and humans batter zombies, and once the films starts escalating it becomes epic fun, while still finding time for the characters and audience to breathe. It's very much a game of plateaus. You reach the next level of crazy, take a breather, and then dive back in to the chaos, always with a goal in mind. Save the ones you love.Interestingly, this last thought brings the question of tone to the forefront. As I said, it's not particularly scary, but it has this weird mixture of comedy and drama that almost shouldn't work, but does, thanks to Sang-ho Yeon's immaculate direction. The character elements, all of their fears and relationships, are treated seriously, but the film knows when to indulge in the wackiness of its scenarios to the point that I would characterize the movie as ""fun."" Essentially, the knowledge of when to play things straight, and when to chew the scenery, and not have either element tip the scales too much, is the film's biggest victory. If you want an insane action movie, Sang-ho's got you covered. Ditto for an oddly touching character drama. Just be ready for the metric fuck-tons of gore.FINAL TAKE: Train to Busan is fantastic. It's a simple story that evolves into an absurd spectacle, but the context never overtakes or surmounts its characters. Therefore, even in its most hectic moments, it retains a strong emotional core that carries you through. Train to Busan knows that good action requires good motivation. Splattering skulls is all well and good, but we need to know why doing it matters.","

"hnt_dnl","30 December 2021","On the heels of the insanely popular new series Squid Game and having seen Season 1 and being impressed with that show, I decided to take a look at TRAIN TO BUSAN (2016), also a very popular South Korean output. First and foremost, I've never been a big fan of the zombie movie sub-genre of horror, even though horror is my favorite genre of all. So that was one strike against this film going in. But mainly, I felt that many of the emotional beats of this film were forced and poorly written.I thought that the main actor, who played the smiling guy who recruited contestants at the subway in Squid Game, was almost completely devoid of emotion and I didn't care about the relationship with his daughter. Whether the character was cowardly, indifferent, or heroic, I never bought the emotions. The acting in the first scene with him and his daughter was so static and boring. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the actor playing the weak-willed, bossy businessman was so ridiculously over the top, just yelling all his dialogue.But generally, I thought all the acting in this movie wasn't very good. Overly long camera closeups of characters doing long stares into the camera, forced emotional exchanges, hokey melodramatic crying and yelling. I just didn't feel anything for these characters. The daughter was especially annoying, and also the high school girl with the baseball team felt like watching a fashion model trying to act. The older lady who was separated from her sister had blank face throughout the entire movie and people really think that's great acting? I don't see how someone can watch this cloying film and the amazing level of acting that was on display in Squid Game and think that the acting is remotely the same level.Then the plotholes, like why were the people on the train just staring for so long while watching a person get attacked? Characters were just staring into space. Why did the father just forget about his daughter early on? Why did he shut the door on the pregnant woman and her husband when they were already clear of the approaching zombies? It's like the writers needed an excuse for him to be weak and cowardly, but there was no danger if he keeps the door open and let's the couple in. They had plenty of time to shut out the zombies while saving the couple. Why did the lady's sister just stand there and refuse to be saved? Why did the other sister kill the mob when it was irrelevant since they did the main group a favor putting them in a completely safe car anyway? How does the cowardly businessman REALIZE that he's infected? Every person prior to him immediately turned into zombies. How did it take him so long to turn? The writing for this movie is textbook audience manipulation.Why did everyone all of a sudden turn into an angry mob just because of the overly dramatic businessman incessantly yelling? It was obvious that the group that survived and made it to that part of the train were not infected. The movie established from the beginning that infection happens in seconds and people turn into fast zombies. These people weren't growling or clawing or running towards them. It made no sense other than the writers needed some big ""emotional"" moment of social commentary on mob mentality and class warfare on a train.Finally, the film dragged on for far too long. No horror movie should be 2 hours long. Keep it at 1 hour, 45 minutes or less. Endless scenes of boring characters running away from zombies just makes me eventually root for the zombies.","

"chiaramariecapritta","20 September 2023","This film came out few years ago, I already knew what was going to happen, but this didn't stop me from crying my heart out... there's something really special in the way Koreans make zombie's movies, I think this is one of the best I've ever seen, considering the year in which it was made it has some special effects that some countries still can't reach now in 2023...
Gon Yoo is definitely one of the best Korean actors of our time, I hope that Korean movies and actors will have more considerations all around the world.Korean cinema definitely has nothing to envy from an American production!Definitely worth your time, from the plot, to the special effects to the actors, good job.","

"Irishchatter","21 November 2021","So basically I'm hearing from a YouTuber that this show is getting a remake by Hollywood which will instead include New York (seriously known to be garbage with originality) and I decided to give it a try. It was nice seeing Gong Woo from Squid Game take a different role as a father. I just can't get over though that this movie had a stupidly abrupt ending like can we not see the little girl reunite with her mother? Can we not see at least a vaccine announcement and be able to find her father? Can we not see the pregnant woman name her child after the father? I mean. WHY DIDNT THEY FREAKING ADD ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF SCENES IN WTF MAN?!?!Can I mention that the zombies in this weren't that scary like I just felt they were rather over the top! The blue eyes really makes them like they were possessed more than infected. If this was a demon or a supernatural type of film, I would've understood it more but yeah I would even call the zombies forgettable. Sorry I'm not part of the ""Train to Busan"" fan club..","

You feel sorry for the characters who got beaten by the zombies and you hope that those who still alive... stay alive.When I watch this movie for the first time I couldn't believe what I saw. The photography is excellent and the music is magnificent.I must also mention the actors who did an extraordinary job.The father and the daughter form a tandem and we are really sad at the end of the last scene.Un train pour Busan is also a film that shows how human beings can be mean or even filthy when faced with certain situations.","

The actors are great - believably emotional and terrified. Kudos to the zombie actors, they are intense and very talented. It must be hard to play a zombie with the ticks, drooling, and random body movements. Highly recommend.","

Train to Busan may have all the hallmarks of classic zombie flicks, but its clear execution and vicious monsters keep it entertaining along with a handful of gruesomely memorable scenes.","

"Jqn_Hgar","20 September 2016","Train To Busan is simply one of the best films I've seen this year, and probably the best Zombie movie since 28 Days Later. One of the strongest elements in the film is the screenplay, it works so damn good, giving each character enough time to develop and at the same time keeping us on the edge of our seats with every scene. this movie plays like a video game every level is a scene, and with every level the protagonists go through it gets even harder and more complicated. the actors did an incredible job, I swear to god I nearly cried a couple of times during the run time of the film. Overall this is a very exciting and emotional ride, it's clever with it's pace and character development, the action scenes were brilliantly executed although I don't remember the protagonists killing a single zombie during the entirety of the movie, it also offers a good little twist on the zombie genre, it looks like it was there to serve the advancement of the plot but it's really clever and it worked well. bring some tissues along with you to theater, i dare you not to cry at least once when you see it. 9/10","

"begob","4 March 2017","A dead-beat dad is forced to choose his daughter over his work, but as they settle into their train journey a zombie sneaks aboard ...Bit of a plod as it sets up the emotional stuff, but once the action gets going the story never lets up. This is much better than Snowpiercer, and conveys the zombie satire of society every bit as well as Romero. Plus the emotional moments are truly good. Plenty of humour, but no laughs for me - all in the translation, except the final scene was crying out for a close up on the sniper's face as he heard the singing.Performances are good, with an impressive turn by the little girl.Music, editing - good. And the pile-on effects with zombie corpses were effective.Overall: Good zombiness.","

"robertemerald","5 December 2019","If you want to know what Train to Busan is like then think World War Z (2013) without the need to pay homage to Brad Pitt the scientist action hero. Busan is much more a touching tale of an ordinary man and his cute as pie daughter caught up in world slamming events. Those events broil away just as the train is leaving and then spill like angry snakes and writhing intestines at every survivable turn right through to the hold on to your seat ending. Amazing cinematography combined with amazing scenes of thrashing humanity. This one is worth every penny.","

"water_boy1993","13 September 2016","First, I have to say, the mark 10 I gave here is just because of my own emotion to this movie. This movie makes me cry a few times while watching it. The plot is normal, we could probably guess almost the movie. However, all the other things are great! The music, perfect! The cinematography, amazing! There are some really great scenes in this movie which I highly respect the director! This movie reaches all our emotion, all at the highest level like when it comes to the action scene, it makes me worry and follow all of them, my heart is beating fast like them; when it comes to the emotional scene, I cry and feel really sad.. So, in general, if you're a ""emotion guy"" like me, you could probably like this. If you're kinda strict, you could just give it mark 7. It's all depend on your type of person.","

"ArcherAdam","22 February 2019","Fantastic riff on World War Z, Train To Busan never lets up long enough for you to catch your breath once it gets going. The movie's gore is surprisingly tame, but it's so well placed that you might think it's bloodier than it actually is.At its core, it's actually a beautiful film about a father reconnecting with his daughter after he spends most of his time chasing his career rather than caring for his family. It's exciting, tragic, and often heroic as he fights to get his daughter to safety. I can honestly say it's the first zombie movie that made me both bite my nails AND cry at the same time. It's more action than horror, but when that action is meshed with suspense and horror it's an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. See it.","

"pal05052003","4 September 2016","Koreans are good at making horror, and this zombie movie attempt shows how skillful they are. You have fast-running zombies, blood spattering, and selfish people. The film delivers shock value, and decent drama along the way. It feels like World War Z without CGI zombies piling on each other. Being set on a train, the plot is also similar to Snowpiercer, another train horror movie. (what is this obsession with trains, or is it the only place in Korea where the space is cramped?)The acting is decent, and the casts are pretty average-looking; with the exception of the lead actor, which makes the story more credible. The director did not focus too much on morality issues like the Walking Dead, but sets up new problems for the characters to face at different stages of the movie. This makes the plot move quickly and smoothly. The ending was rather conventional, but I guess no one hates a happy ending.","

Love SK movies but this one was frustrating and the ending sucked so bad. It was like the director loved all the good characters throughout the movie then woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning and decided he hated them and killed them all off. Wanted to like it but for that reason ended up hating it and the second one was even worse of a watch.","

"denise-99445","1 May 2022","One of the best zombie/horror movies I've seen in a really long time. Strong cast, including the young girl. Even though the screen writer relied on common tropes, such as the cheerleader, jock and self-absorbed, work-alcoholic, divorced father, each the characters was fully developed and given an arc that gave them room to grow. By the time the movie ended, I felt as though I had endured their arduous journey and fight to survive. The movie made me laugh, cry and cheer for the characters. It had your villains, your heroes and those who straddled the line. The movie really had it all. Although the ending was heartbreaking, it also made you hopeful that better days lay ahead.","

"johnsonzac","14 March 2019","Train to Busan is a movie that you probably haven't heard about. I didn't either until my dad forced me to watch it with him. He didn't tell me much about it, except that it was a zombie movie. We've seen zombie movies, the cliche walking corpses and the race to survive. I figured it would be just like them, and wasn't prepared for much. Boy, was I wrong. If you can get past the subtitles, you should brace yourself for an emotional, action-packed and morally challenging adventure, as there is nothing like this movie and I doubt there will be for a long time. Unlike well-known zombie-horror films/shows like The Walking Dead or World War Z, Train to Busan manages to create an emotional attachment to the characters. Even though the main character starts out as a prick, we still feel for him and want to see him improve. It kind of reminds of me of the movie Shaun of the Dead, in the sense of a unique approach to the cliche. Shaun of the Dead takes a more comedic and wacky approach to the cliche, with some hints of seriousness, and Train to Busan takes a serious and somewhat realistic approach, with some comedic moments, which is a good balance. The movie somehow packs in these emotional attacks with exciting unique action into a two-hour film, making it hands down the best zombie survival movie along with providing a unique and enjoyable experience.The film starts with the main character Gong Yoo (It's Korean) sitting in an office space and is depicted as a supervisor or administrator of a large corporation. He returns home for his daughter's birthday, late, and gives her a Wii U, which she already got from her mom. He also missed her singing performance, causing her to lose confidence and stutter out of singing. Right off the bat, we know that he's not the best father, but he still cares for her. Things get serious when they board a train to the city Busan to see her mother, as a strange and hysterical woman sneaks on board. Of course, that woman is what you would call a zombie, and thus the classic virus spreading action begins. While their whole city is worrying about their own zombie attack, we get to see it from the point of view of train passengers who are cramped in a small linear passage trying to survive.If you were to just look up the movie and take a glance at it, it would look silly. It's hard to make a zombie movie not look ridiculous. Now before you say ""Well it's a zombie movie, isn't that silly?"" While that is true, the movie somehow takes a silly and cliche concept and magically turns it into something serious, exciting, and original. Of course, there are some inescapable unrealistic moments; such as train security not noticing a clearly strange woman without a ticket board the train, or nobody regarding the woman while on the train. Those are just nit-picky things you can't avoid.Every movie has its faults, yet the faults in Train to Busan don't even come near to how amazing the film is. As I've said before, the pure emotional value packed in with exciting action makes it so great. I don't know exactly how they did it, but I can tell you that the two ""Us vs Them"" and ""Me vs Us"" themes play a big role. Us vs them is pretty obvious; a group of strangers banded together to fight the evil zombies outside, sharing resources and information. However, the Me vs Us theme goes a bit deeper. Would you sacrifice everything for a bunch of strangers you just met on a train? Or would you abandon them in hopes to survive on your own? We witness the characters go through these decisions and change as the story progresses. Gong Yoo was a businessman who wouldn't raise a thumb to help the poor, yet later on, he risks his life for a homeless man by turning back to help him up to run from a horde of zombies. After watching the movie I felt the effects of its message.Along with moral challenges, by the end of the movie, you will shed a tear. Trust me. You will feel sorrow for the characters. This is one of the few movies where I actually felt sad after watching it, and that's saying something for being a zombie movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for it, and it hit me like, well, a train. A lot of movies you will forget about after a couple of weeks, and some you will hold on to for a very long time. This is one of those that you will hold on to.",NA
"rdoyle29","3 April 2017","A rather neglectful father is taking his daughter by train to visit her mother on the day the zombie apocalypse hits. Naturally zombies get on the train and all hell breaks loose. ""Zombies on a train"" doesn't sound like the most original concept, but writer/director Sang Ho-Yeon not only manages to find interesting things to do with it, he rather effortlessly stretches it out to 2 hours of really intense action ... and he works in some interesting character dynamics too. There's nothing startling here, but it's not predictable and it's actually rather difficult to predict who will live and who will die. Great stuff especially for a really tired genre.",NA

"Zac_La_Porte","24 January 2022","Train to Busan proves South Korea can construct, craft and execute a quality zombie flick. Sang-ho Yeon knows exactly how to create a depiction of what a real zombie outbreak looks like, with ridiculously bizarre zombie chases and flesh-eating tension, but frequently set in motion on the train tracks. We receive brilliant performances from the entire cast, including a superbly emotional father and daughter, as well as other caring personalities.Majority of the characters who the camera encounters and provides significant lines for start and end up being pretty likeable. And there's a lot of areas where this movie is strongly centred around generous characters who self-sacrifice themselves to the zombies just to help others, which also forms some solid emotions. Train to Busan is action-packed, violent and surprisingly quite emotional. Sang-ho Yeon executes these feelings flawlessly from the script he wrote with Joo-Suk Park.Finally heading over to discussing the brilliant zombie action, people are chased and attacked by light-speed zombies who also form into ridiculous waves. The zombies are well-designed, freaky in their twitchy ways and intense. Train to Busan delivers real zombie action! This movie only has very minor issues around keeping viewers completely engaged at all times.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",NA

"sitenoise","20 September 2016","There's the re-animating deer near the beginning; the first few overflowing zombie pile-ups; several great contortion moves; a fantastic fiery Locomotive crash; a hilariously great zombie herd tailgate surf. What am I missing? That's about three minutes of quality movie. A Movie Trailer's worth. And like a movie trailer it's a terrible representation of the film overall--where the other 99% is a T-bomb.The pacing of the film is defecating: Zombies run into a door that's being closed; everyone takes a dump. Lather rinse repeat. The pacing is bad because the writing and acting are awful. ""But you're not supposed to have writing and acting in a zombie movie!"" That's right. So why shove it in our faces? Jung Yu-Mi gets a pass, and I liked the little girl. Ma Dong-Seok doesn't embarrass himself too much because he's strong enough to overcome what he's given. Every line of dialog in the film is bad. Gong Yoo is a twerpy faux-stud who can't act his way out of a genre film. I hope to never watch another film with his over-moisturized face.I had high hopes for this. The three minutes of quality film are fantastic. End of story. Well, actually I like the Korean thing of killing everyone, although I'm not saying if the kid dies or not (like the one in *The Host* did). Korea might be inching toward doing Hollywood better than Hollywood, but it's still crap. I, and I can't believe I'm saying this, enjoyed *The Happening* (2008) more than this. Heck, I enjoyed a Woody Harrelson movie more than this.",NA
