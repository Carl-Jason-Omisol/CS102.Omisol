"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023","Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder.","

"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023","Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly.","

You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me

"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023","On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout.","

"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023","Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did.","

"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023","Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way.","

"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024","I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that.","

"Wonka","kjreiter","18 February 2024","This is another one of those movies (turned out to be a musical) that I really wanted to like. Unfortunately it is a one and done for me. The songs are forgettable, and the story is boring. What a shame. The 8,9, and 10 reviews are way off, as usual. I wonder what they would give to an actually great movie? Read the 1,2,3, and 4 reviews as they cover it all without me going through it again. The good: the setting is interesting, the acting is good, and the CGI is ok. If Hollywood keeps putting out stinkers like this, nobody is ever going to return to the theaters like they did 5 years ago. For the sake of the theatre industry, please do better than this. Boring movie, I mean musical. Stream it if you must.","

"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023","My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timothée Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion.","

"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023","Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timothée Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023","I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up.","

"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024","I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do.","

I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat.

"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024","I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me.","

This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed?

It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing.","

"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023","Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10.","

"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024","I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timothée Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure.","

There were a lot of musical numbers, but no one could sing. I absolutely hated the weird plot of everyone being enslaved in the washer room. The only time it held my interest, and my excitement was the final song which was from the original movie! And the only reason that was good was because it was nostalgic.

When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star.","

They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one.","

"Wonka","Socolorfull","7 January 2024","Boring about sums it up. We all know that just because a film has a few big names in it doesn't mean it will be great. It tries to be whimsical, but fails. The songs are mediocre. Noodle is supposed to be the heart of the movie, but her acting leaves much to be desired. Yes, she is a child, but if you're going to make a child the emotional center of a movie, that child needs to be able to carry that, and she can't.Has any sequal/prequel/offshoot of the Wonka universe ever captured the zany magic of the original? I don't think so, so maybe we should stop trying.This movie was at its best and most fun when people were eating wonka's magical chocolate. Everything in between that was just bad fluff. The repetitiveness of the movie was grating to me. Please stop with the same joke over and over and over again.The end did come to a sweet conclusion that may make you tear up a bit, but the ride to get there just isn't worth it.Skip this one. And if you are going to see it, don't bring your three year old with you. Where in the previews did it seem like this would be a movie that would entertain a toddler??? It's a live action musical, for goodness sake. Please save yourself, and everyone else in the theater, a headache, and don't bring your toddler to this movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Who thought that a chocolate cartel would be a fun little plot device? This movie was billed as a family film. While sure, there are things in a family film meant to go over the head of the kids in the audience, these are usually throwaway jokes that don't impact understanding of the plot. The chocolate cartel was the WHOLE conflict of the movie. What does a child know about a cartel?","

"Wonka","robfollower","1 January 2024","The reception is quite positive for Wonka . I however could not get into this film It is not bad , the film is just to tame . ""Wonka"" could use more tart notes; at times it's borderline saccharine. There's no shiver of menace here, this is not the persona Willy Wonka is known for being sarcastic in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wonka is a quirky, eccentric character who is known for brushing off questions and using sarcasm to ignore them ,this is what make the role such a good character Study .It takes only moments into the film, when star Timothée Chalamet first opens his mouth to sing, to discover Wonka's errors: The songs are that not good, and the guy singing them is even worse.Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. Performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming . There is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesn't take me on a trip like the original did. Or for that matter the 2005 Johnny Depp version ; FYI If you love Weird and strange Depp's acting is for you. It is bat crazy !Some of the songs of this the 2023 reimaging tale weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless. On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive. 6/10.Everlasting gobstopper ...........No one will ever play the bright comic exterior and dark soul of Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder did in 1971. Wilder remains the gold standard in the role of Willy Wonka with his mad genius -- which featured a snarky edge and a hint of darkness.","

"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023","As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you.","

"Wonka","ericstevenson","25 December 2023","The trailers gave us an impression of a heartwarming movie and that's exactly what we got. This is probably not a direct prequel to the 1971 film, although the Oompa Loompas do look exactly as they do in that movie. This movie features Willy Wonka being tricked into working in a laundromat because he didn't read the fine print, a reference to the original film. He meets other people who were tricked and they help him escape so he can sell his chocolate. The imagery is amazing, although there's only one Oompa Loompa who doesn't appear until halfway through the film. It's certainly a wonderfully colorful movie.The best part about the movie is that it's a wonderfully upbeat film. My brother was even crying through it and he almost never cries! I wish I could have looked to see him do that. The sidestory with the orphan was probably the most heartwarming. Even the funny sidestories end up becoming relevant in the end. What a wonderful film and a very Merry Christmas for everyone! ***1/2.","

"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023","Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka"".","

"Wonka","mjp-94498","12 March 2024","""Wonka,"" the latest reimagining of the beloved candy manufacturer's tale, unfortunately, leaves a bitter taste. The film's most glaring misstep is its lead, Timothée Chalamet, whose portrayal of the eccentric Willy Wonka is as inconsistent as the flavors of a botched batch of Every Flavour Beans. Throughout the film, Chalamet seems to forget the essence of what made Wonka such an iconic character, delivering a performance that is as forgettable as it is confusing.The film's failure to capture the whimsical charm of its predecessors is not helped by the audience's inability to view Chalamet's performance objectively. It appears that his physical appeal has clouded the judgment of many, leading to a hype that is disconnected from the actual quality of his acting. This phenomenon raises questions about the standards we hold for performances in Hollywood and whether we are too quick to praise based on looks rather than talent.In conclusion, ""Wonka"" serves as a stark reminder that not all that glitters is gold. Behind the attractive facade lies a performance that lacks the depth and charisma required to bring such a complex character to life. It's a confectionery concoction that, despite its visual appeal, fails to satisfy the palate of those craving a substantial cinematic experience.","

"Wonka","gogarrett","18 December 2023","This movie seemed to have it all. All of the actors played parts well and Timothee Chalamet is certainly fun to watch. The bits with the Oompah Loompa, played by Hugh Grant, should have been expanded. The sets, costumes and special effects were amazing. The music was from the original Wonka movie so that was nice. The story was almost completely new which I hoped to be nice too. Not so much. The spark I was looking for in the new story was missing for me, even though the actors and director were clearly giving it their best shot at it. I think the writing was the culprit. I was a bit bored in parts. If the writers were looking to get laughs, I don't recall breaking a smile more than once or twice and I think it was something that Rowan Atkinson was doing as the Priest. I did not hear anyone laugh in the theater the whole time. Most of the jokes I think we were supposed to laugh at were pretty lame. I will not be recommending this movie to any adult or child I know. I don't see it appealing to any age unless they are big fans of someone appearing in the film.","

"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023","Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10.","

"Wonka","jp_91","7 December 2023","""Wonka"" is a pleasant prequel to ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", the script achieves a perfect story for the holiday season and for the whole family, with a simple but effective comedy and good dramatic moments that are strong points for the film production. The production level is excellent, the costume design manages to be fun and the performances are good, especially that of Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka, in addition to a successful special performance by Sally Hawkins. The musical numbers are well choreographed and managed to be performed by the voices of the entire cast. One negative thing to highlight are the digital special effects that look fake in every scene in which they are added. The editing work is of a good level. The music composed for the film has potential and is enjoyable. ""Wonka"" shines as a great movie for the Christmas season.","

Don't go and see this film.The musical is built around the ""Pure imagination"" track from the original movie, however hasn't done much in it's attempts to spring board from there, creating rather a drab and uninspired musical around that!They shouldn't have used that original song, not really, in that it appears to have revealed a considerable lack of musical talent, in so far as the new songs are concerned, within a musical production, in this case!The musical whimpered on throughout a meaningless story, it all felt rather uninspired, with consideration to what came before it, featuring not a single character of interest, going on to fizzle out leaving nothing at all. I'm struggling to write about it in fact, it being almost entirely forgettable.Timothy's Wonka, the character, is actually very good, as are some of the villains within this, however everything else simply fails to leave a mark.

"Wonka","magadalwarmayur","11 December 2023","Wonka, the latest film from director Paul King, takes us on a journey into the fantastical world of Willy Wonka's early life. While the film is visually delightful and boasts a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet, its chaotic story and forgettable music leave it feeling bittersweet.Chalamet shines as a young Willy Wonka, brimming with youthful enthusiasm and boundless creativity. His performance is a welcome departure from the more jaded interpretations of the character, injecting a much-needed dose of innocence and wonder. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant round out the cast with memorable supporting roles, adding humor and depth to the film.The film's greatest strength lies in its visual feast. The vibrant sets and costumes bring the Chocolate Factory to life in all its fantastical glory, creating a truly immersive experience for the audience. King's signature whimsical style shines through, crafting a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere that is sure to captivate children and adults alike.However, Wonka's charm is somewhat diminished by its chaotic story. The plot feels convoluted and lacks focus, making it difficult to follow at times. This is further exacerbated by the film's foray into musical territory. While the songs are visually stunning, they are unfortunately plagued by generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. They ultimately feel disconnected from the narrative, serving as unwelcome interruptions rather than emotional enhancements.While not quite reaching the heights of King's Paddington films, Wonka manages to entertain with its whimsical tone and charming performances. Fans of Chalamet and visually stunning musicals will likely find much to enjoy. However, those seeking a more focused and emotionally resonant experience may find themselves left wanting. Overall, Wonka is a visually delightful and whimsical film that ultimately feels like a mixed bag of treats, leaving one with a taste of both satisfaction and disappointment.","

We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together. I'm not dissatisfied with the film, but I am disappointed because it could and should have been much better, more magical, more appealing, and - tastier.","

Also I absolutely love the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film starring Gene Wilder. It was the type of film that is no longer made successfullybthese days. A musical with great central performance and great supporting characters. And most of all a whimsical quality that is endearing and memorable. This new film Wonka had none of that....It is the backstory of Willy Wonka. Wonka is played by Timothée Chalamet. His performance is not a bad one but he dies not embody the character like I wish he would. There is nothing distinctive about his performance. I understand that he's playing a young Wonka but this character seems completely different from the one played by Gene Wilder. The story is basically about Wonka arriving in Europe to open his chocolate shop. The owners of the the big chocolate factories want to destroy him. Along the way there is a collection of completely forgettable songs and characters that are also forgettable. I get that this is a musical and not high drama but nothing that happens is not at all involving. The production values are good but the film has no sense of wonder and whimsy that this story requires. I was mostly bored. There are a couple decent moments but it just a film without inspiration....Grade: C-","

The movie feels more like an episode of Wonka's adventures, and that's it. Doesn't stand out as a movie at all.You can tell Wonka is extraordinary: he produces the best chocolate in the world from night to day, and everything about him comes with a magic trick. But there's never really a look into his magic. Instead, this is a very campy adventure about this silly guy and his friends trying to escape the bad guys. That's it.Disappointing. A couple of songs stand out. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm not into something this campy.However, Timothée Chalamet stands out. He proves he's a very good actor who can pull off almost any role.

It was never supposed to be anything ground-breaking, nor was it supposed to punch above its weight. And as expected, Wonka turns out to be a decently delightful cinematic experience that nails the basics of a lighthearted film: a plot that keeps you engaged, characters with whom you can empathize, humor that's not too silly nor inappropriate, and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't deviate from a storytelling formula we've known to work. From start to finish, it maintains a charming and approachable tone that makes it enjoyable for audiences of all ages.What stands out the most in this movie is its colorful and innovative production design, where the visual aesthetics are nothing short of stunning. The attention to detail in both set design and cinematography contributes to creating a magical atmosphere that enhances the overall viewing experience. The musical numbers too complement the storyline well by adding a lively and entertaining dimension to the film, contributing to the overall enjoyment without overpowering the narrative.In summary, ""Wonka"" is a well-rounded and enjoyable movie that hits all the right notes. With its cute and charming demeanor, impressive production design, and a satisfying origin story, there's little to criticize. If you've been wanting to go check it out, go ahead.

Why is Willy Wonka illiterate, what was the point of that? Why would all other chocolate makers be fine with each other as competition, but not this new guy?But most annoying, how is this an origin story? There was no explanation whatsoever as to how he made floating candy. Not to mention, he didn't have any in the original movie, so how did he have it in the origin story?Show me Loompaland where Willy met and saved the Oompa Loompas, remember that from the original? Show me how he built the Chocolate Factory, where he got the ideas? Why was he so zany? Show him being betrayed by workers, giving rise to why he only employed Oompa Loompas. Give me some reason why he wanted to give it all away.You know, keep continuity with what we already know instead of just creating some random story, that means very little in the context of Willy Wonka.Hollywood is nothing but remakes, prequels, sequels, spinoffs, etc these days. It is nothing but taking properties that have existing fanbases, but then what they create simply isn't in line with that property. While Wonka is less offensive than many others, this is a pretty big missed opportunity to me.","

Mrs Scrubitt's interactions with Noodle, while supposedly tyrannical, were accompanied by a comedic film score and rather cringeworthy attempts at being a convincing bully. At one point, in a fit of rage, Mrs Scrubitt kicks Noodle, but her acting belied her supposed fury and the 'kick' ended up as a rather awkward, gentle tap.The songs felt like they took inspiration from The Polar Express - a mix of pallatable numbers alongside others that were probably written by someone high on sugar. Any you find memorable are likely to be those from the original film by Leslie Bricusse.The presence of Sally Hawkins, Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson and the odd one or two more capable actors/actresses brought some relief, but it wasn't enough to remove the overriding impression of it being a rather poorly written stage production.","

Tom Holland would've been a much better actor to portray Willy Wonka. Timothee's acting came across very green and uncommitted to the role, almost like someone got him the part. This pulled me out of the story. I understand they needed a younger looking actor to play the role since it was the prequel. However, there are many other younger actors that could have played this role and been more convincing. Sorry.I think the effects were spot on! Even Hugh Grant looked very believable as an Umpa Lumpa and was funny.","

"Wonka","robabwilliams","21 January 2024","I decided to check out this movie after all the hype with people giving it 9 and 10/10, but I honestly feel like I watched a completely different film. It was just bad, not even the ""so bad it's good"" kind of bad. The acting was alright (Hugh Grant was probably the highlight), and with an A-list cast and a high budget, there's no excuse for it to be this disappointing. The story, dialogue, and music were major letdowns. It felt like I was watching a local amateur production of a rejected Willy Wonka musical that couldn't make it to Broadway.The plot didn't make much sense; it was like someone asked ChatGPT to write a script for a Willy Wonka prequel. The film also struggled to decide whether it wanted to be British or American, making it a confusing mess. I was initially skeptical about a Willy Wonka prequel, especially after not being a fan of the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton remake, but after watching this, I think I owe Tim Burton an apology. The original Gene Wilder film was perfection, and this attempt again falls far short.","

"Wonka","Ingrouille181","11 December 2023","I had no interest in seeing Wonka. Just like Solo: A Star Wars Story, I didn't need a movie about Willy Wonka's backstory; his real story is in the main story of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Sometimes less is more, and leaving his backstory out gives him more mystery and intrigue. I liked Timothee Chalamet as Wonka well enough, he's got great charisma, and all of the other cast do a great job too. The songs are really hit or miss, and most feel like songs I've heard in lesser known musicals before. It's passable for a Willy Wonka origin story. I appreciated the characters love of chocolate and wonder. But I think a movie like 2000s Chocolat (ironically staring Johnny Depp) plays with the love of chocolate and fantasy better, I'd recommend it more than this. Maybe giving Wonka the Greatest Showman set up would've helped this movie more. If you're a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fan, this probably won't do much for you. I'll give it a solid 6 out of 10.","

"Wonka","lodger-56981","10 March 2024","I'm so embarrassed for Timothee Chalamet. I've never been so sad or disappointed in him since, well, Dune. This is a horrible movie. Derivative drivel. It's like the makers of this movie couldn't figure out what to do with this undesired movie - so they just watch Annie a thousand times and decided to copy the plot points. I know this movie is for kids - but why does it have to be for mentally challenged children. Chalamet has absolutely no idea what to do here. He is so out of his depths that he just flounders aimlessly on the screen for 2 hours. Key - or is it Peele - not its Key - isn't it? Regardless, he is horribly cast as well. Apparently the guy who did Borat realized this movie was crud and turned down the role. Olivia Coleman is wasted in her role too. Any D-list actress could have done this role. They could have got one of the Kardashians and the results would have been the same. Hugh Grant already admitted he did it for the money - and it shows. (Also Ayo Edebiri should steal that little girl for stealing her face). Just disappointing all around. And the songs - oh God - the songs are lame and atrocious. Never mind that Chalamet sings about as good as he raps in that old video. This is horrible in every sense. There is not one clever or original idea here. Roald Dahl deserves better. Gene Wilder deserves better. Hell, even Johnny Depp deserves better. Let's face it - The world deserves better.","

"Wonka","martimusross","28 January 2024","WonkaOh dear!It was quite inexplicable, this movie was an origin story for Willy Wonka, why anyone thought this was needed, necessary or appropriate I have no clue.It had no touch of Dahl at all, and his wicked cruel sense of children's humour beloved across the world. This was a bland facsimile populated by beige characters.I watched it because of Timothée Chalamet, Hugh Grant, Tom Davis and Olivia Coleman and they really tried to make something of this putrid pastiche. The acting was top hole but the script was bottom drawer. Mister Dahl would have hated it, and never watched, whilst taking a fat cheque in royalties, ever the mercenary!Timothée's singing and dancing was excellent but embedded in a flawed monstrosity of imagination.I cannot see any child enjoying this having been press-ganged by their parents to go to the movies.I'm giving this a firm 3 outta 10, having ruminated over this, I give all 3 points to Hugh Grant he was horribly fabulous!","

"Wonka","haydyno","16 December 2023","This movie is advertised as an origin to Willy Wonka. Instead it should be advertised as a musical that has a merry-go-round plot that never actually progresses. We don't actually know anything else about Wonka that we know from the original.The plot starts off with Wonka getting trapped in smelly laundry/hotel with some other prisoners. Right then and there the writers trap the main character behind an almost impossible way of escape. So for about an hour of this film, Wonka attempts to escape this, and ultimately gets bought out by Slugworth. His candy shop is destroyed, and then he decides he wants to help Noodle by going after his ""Chocolate Mafia"". The last minute of the movie rushes around with Wonka and the Oompa Loompa creating a factory and that's it.Hugh Grant delivers an awesome Oompa Loompa performance, however his lack of screen time and interaction with Wonka was very disappointing.If you're going to this movie expecting to see how Wonka creates his inventions, chocolates, factory, and discovery of Oompa Land, well you'll be leaving like a bad batch of Wonka chocolate.","

"Wonka","MrDHWong","14 December 2023","""Wonka"" is a musical fantasy film that serves as an origin story of the character of Willy Wonka from the novel ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl. Directed by Paul King (""Paddington"" 1 and 2) and starring Timothée Chalamet in the lead role, it is a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd.In an unnamed European town, inventor and magician Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives to fulfil his childhood dream of running his own chocolate shop. Searching for a place to stay, Wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. After failing to read the fine print, Wonka finds himself in debt to Mrs. Scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. While labouring away, Wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to Mrs. Scrubbit's contract; young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), plumber Piper (Natasha Rothwell), accountant Abacus (Jim Carter), phone operator Lottie (Rakhee Thakrar), and comedian Larry (Rich Fulcher). The five prisoners inform Wonka that the city is controlled by the ""Chocolate Cartel"", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Mr. Fickelgruber (Mathew Boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. Wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.One of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", the timeless tale of a young boy named Charlie Bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. Since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. Further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and to a lesser extent Tim Burton's 2005 film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of Willy Wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. The 2023 film ""Wonka"" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.Although I'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of Willy Wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. When we first meet the young Wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. Upon arriving at his destination, Wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. In fact, no less than three minutes later, Wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. Things take a turn for the worst when Wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.In spite of all his hardships, Wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. What I enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance Wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. This is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. As a result, the otherwise off-putting Willy Wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.Being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. While the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, I found that most of them weren't all that memorable. The one original musical number I liked the most was near the beginning, where Wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to ""Scrub Scrub"" until all their debts are paid. The reason I enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most Roald Dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.Additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. For instance, the ""Oompa Loompa"" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Instead of singing about misbehaving children, Lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. The older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" film and I'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but I can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.As the title character, I liked the youthful spin Timothée Chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. His take on Willy Wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. Chalamet's Wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of Gene Wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of Johnny Depp's version. This almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both Wilder's and Depp's Wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. I would say this does work for the most part, however, I personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.Most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially Wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. With that in mind, Noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. Although I did like the idea of her being Wonka's street smart friend, I think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. Early in the film, we learn that Wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where Noodle comes in to teach him how to read. Being an orphan who never went to school, how did Noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? We never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. I'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive English skills.I thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but Mr. Slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. Slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. This film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. I suppose this would make Slugworth the Gus Fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. On that note, I just wish we could have seen more of Mr. Prodnose's and Mr. Fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. It just seems like all of Matt Lucas's and Mathew Baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything Slugworth says.Though far from essential viewing, ""Wonka"" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. It may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. Had the film placed more focus on developing its supporting cast and fixing some plot holes, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Still, you could definitely do a whole lot worse than what we got so all I can say is just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I rate it 7/10.","

"Wonka","dougy-tz","25 January 2024","Willy Wonka almost seemed like a side character in his own movie. Instead of being about Wonka and the Oompa Loompa (played very well by Hugh Grant) it's more about an orphan girl called Noodle. God forbid you could make a movie about a white man doing something positive on his own merit. Imagine how fun the movie could have been with the Oompa Loompa and Wonka making the beginnings of the chocolate factory from the ground up, traveling the world and getting to know lots of interesting sub characters from around the world (then at least the forced inclusivity would have made sense.) Instead the whole movie is centred around a little area where the rival chocolate makers shops are located, they are boring forgettable characters as are 90 percent of the characters in the movie. You're not going to find people 30 years from now still using the names like you would with a Veruca Salt to describe someone's behaviour. In fact I genuinely doubt people will still be talking about this in a few months time, like most recent Hollywood drivel it's another forgetful movie from the meat grinder.The movie is bizarre most of the time, with ridiculous out of this world magic tricks happening that make no sense. Timotheé Chalamet seemed to be doing his best Jim Carrey impression as well. They could have made this movie and called it something else, you really don't have to tarnish the name of such an iconic character. I really wish I hadn't given this movie the time of day as it wasn't worth it.","

"Wonka","lei_lei1","7 January 2024","Its clear that warner bros have chosen a director for this movie with a real vision for what it could look like, because quite literally 90% of the budget went into its set design (and rowan atkinson).In all seriousness though, the set design is gorgeous. Glamorous actually, would be a better word to put it. Great trees with pink tinted rosy petals and 20th Century alleyways that look like they're from the set of Harry Potter and all the color and lights you could want in a lifetime.But everything else in the movie just doesn't live up to the set design. The acting feels artificial. Lines feel memorized and delivered without intent, which makes it hard to concentrate on the movie. The best performance we saw throughout the entire movie was literally from the oompa loompa. And for a musical, this movie is just weak. Songs feel forced, and lyrics fail miserably to hit the mark. Like take a look at this stuff:""If you want to view paradise, simply look at them and view it Somebody to hold on to, it's all we really need, nothing else to it""Also I should probably mention that like 90% of the actors can't sing and rely heavily on autotune, which is obviously perfect for a musical. But nonetheless, I enjoyed watching the movie. I won't ever watch it again nor remember any of its songs, but it felt good watching it. That's all I can say. If you have a kids or a family or are just in the mood for some nice lighthearted chocolate factory lore, you will like this movie. It felt like a music video or a high school production actually. Rehearsed lines, funky costumes, characters that try to be funny, but it felt good and it kinda made sense, and I don't regret watching it. It kinda made me feel like a kid actually, and I liked that.3/10. Not. The highest rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie.","

"Wonka","tarascopablo","12 December 2023","First of all... This new take on a young Wonka is actually fresh and interesting. We were used on Wonka being a secondary character of Charlie and the golden ticket story.The movie is well crafted but it has serious problems:i) Chalamet is a fantastic actor and has the potential to be one of the great ones of his generation BUT he was a miscast. Im sorry, but i just don´t see him as Wonka.Ii) Part of what makes a musical great is that the songs and numbers are meant to be remarkable and catchy. After almost 80 years, people still sing singin´in the rain yet Wonka has no memorable song or tune except for the Oompa Loompa bit that was taken straight outta the original one.To me, this 2 flaws are terrible and make it a bad Wonka movie and a bad musical but taking those out of the equation, it is actually a good film.Enjoy it with your loved ones,Stay safe and happy holidays.","

"Wonka","ferguson-6","12 December 2023","Greetings again from the darkness. It appears as though I'm one of the few early viewers who walked away without having been beguiled or enraptured with this musical prequel to Roald Dahl's 1964 story, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Full disclosure requires me to admit that I actually found it a bit dull, and that's mostly due to the lead performance by Timothy Chalamet. I understand that he's the hottest young actor working today, and brings along an entire fan base, but for me, Willy Wonka should have a twinkle in his eye, a spring in his step, and enough charm to draw folks in ... even at a younger age.Writer-director Paul King and co-writer Simon Farnaby collaborated on the thoroughly entertaining PADDINGTON 2 (2017) and are back at it in this third film from Dahl's classic children story. Most recently, there was Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005), and it's been more than 50 years since Gene Wilder bounded between charming and menacing in Mel Stuart's WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971). King and Farnaby deliver an origin story which allows for a much nicer (or should it be sweeter) Willy Wonka, and instead sprinkles the menace on a few supporting characters, ensuring some dark themes are present.A ""deal"" with Willy's mother (Sally Hawkins) has the illiterate Wonka arriving in town with only a few coins in his pocket, and a dream to build his chocolate factory. His innocence and naivety soon leave him penniless and contracted into indentured servitude, along with some others, at a shady laundry establishment run by the dentally challenged Mrs Scrubbitt (Oscar winner Olivia Colman) and her baritone behemoth assistant Bleacher (Tom Davis). Willy bonds with the others being held captive, including young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), who somehow holds the same optimistic outlook as her new friend. Willy soon discovers that he has landed in the town with a chocolate cartel led by Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton), the local chocolatiers who bribe the Police Chief (Keegan-Michael Key) with none other than ... chocolate, in order to keep the new kid from selling his superior goodies.Willy has even more challenges to deal with, including a knee-high, orange-faced Oompa-Loompa (Hugh Grant), who seeks restitution by stealing from Willy Wonka while he sleeps. Grant's Oompa-Loompa is a definite highlight here (just as he was in PADDINGTON 2), especially during his song. The other familiar song in the film is ""Pure Imagination"", though none of the new songs by Neil Hannon are particular catchy or memorable.In addition to Grant's sarcastic Oompa-Loompa, another highlight is certainly Nathan Crowley's Production Design, ranging from Scrubbitt's grungy basement to the picturesque town square and ultimately, the chocolate store sequence. The decision to have the young, idealistic Willy overflowing with optimism and lacking the grumpiness and menace of the grown Wonka makes sense for an origin story ... I simply didn't find it as magical, as entertaining, or as interesting.Opens in theaters nationwide on December 15, 2023.","

Don't go thinking this will be the classical Gene Wilder Willy Wonka. This movie appeared to have so much potential, but in reality the previews hyped it up. Can't really call it a prequel when it doesn't really relate to the original movie. The songs were bad. Timothee Chalamet tries to pull off The Greatest Showman impression and comes up short. A typical cash grab attempt by the movie studios... I recommend to wait until it streams somewhere... Almost as bad as the Marvels musical scenes... Almost!","

"Wonka","Dargumin","10 December 2023","When I saw Paul King (who has done a wonderful job with the Paddington films) was directing the new Wonka a film I must admit I was a little optimistic. But sadly rather than seeing a world of pure imagination it really was a world of pure disappointment.Timothee Chalamet had big shoes to fill, following on from the late great Gene Wilder and living legend Johnny Depp in portraying the titular zany choclatier. Sadly he does not have the charisma of either. It was frustrating that he didn't show any of the crankiness or attitude which made Gene Wilder's version of Wonka so brilliant, instead he's presented as a naive dreamer.As a musical, the songs were so mediocre, I can't imagine the kids will remember any of them once they've left the cinema, barring the ones we've heard before in the other films. The film would have been less tiresome if they had skipped many of these songs.At one point during the film I looked at my watch hopeful that there wasn't too much of the film left, yet it turned out it had only been on for 45 minutes at this point and it still had over an hour to go, I literally couldn't comprehend how that first 45 minutes had felt so much longer.If I can say one nice thing, it's that Olivia Coleman, Paterson Joseph and Rich Fulcher were the hilights and helped make the 2 hour slog just about bearable.","

"Wonka","GusherPop","19 December 2023","""Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy.""
""Wonka"" is a two-hour musical comedy directed by Paul King, inspired by Roald Dahl's Wonka books but not strictly following them. The film aims to amuse, delight, and inspire cheers when the bad guys are defeated. The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are likely better than needed to make it a hit, as it is considered a pre-sold property, as many people know and love Willy Wonka. Wonka and Noodle, two orphans, are sympathetic to Wonka's situation. Wonka carries a chocolate bar created by his mom, a candy-maker, for inspiration. The main bad guys are a trio of powerful businessmen who control candy manufacturing and distribution, keep the city's corrupt police force under their control, and have passed laws making it difficult for anyone else to break into the business. The film features Sally Hawkins as Mama Wonka, who becomes a good luck charm for big-budget fantasies. ""Wonka"" is a captivating and enthusiastic film, with a withholding quality from the character of Wonka, who can be likened to Gene Wilder's long-lost grandchild in moments of quiet contemplation and madcap inspiration. The film's effectiveness makes it a cynical enterprise. Wonka, portrayed by Chalamet, is an innocent and earnest character with a distinctly British sensibility. Unlike Depp's and Wilder's portrayals, Chalamet lacks guile and is guarded in an unnamed European city. The humor is set against a visually dense Technicolor world, with costumes and sets beautifully made. Willy Chalamet's performance in ""Wonka"" is a captivating portrayal of a boyish sweetness with a hint of sadness, expressing his love for chocolate-making. He is portrayed as a wholesome character, resembling P. T. Barnum played by Daniel Day-Lewis' son, Chalamet. Chalamet's heartfelt baritone singing is a testament to his character's wholesome nature. The film's lines, such as ""Put your hand inside your pock-elet, get yourself some Wonka chocolate!"", are a testament to the character's belief in the power of chocolate and its ability to elevate one's mood and life. Chalamet's performance is a testament to the power of chocolate and its ability to change lives. The film overrelies on computer-generated effects and stunts, including a miniaturized performance by Hugh Grant as the Oompa-Loompa Lofty. Despite skepticism, Chalamet gives himself fully to the wonderment and vocal demands of the role. The film is a playful, heart-tugging take on a beloved character that is smarter than it lets on. The film's beautiful costumes and sets make it outstanding to watch. ""Wonka"" is a musical prequel to the Roald Dahl tale, featuring Timothée Chalamet as the title character. Willy, a 25-year-old chocolate lover, arrives in London after seven years of sailing around the globe. He has recipes for his candy, such as hoverchoc, an egg of chocolate with a bug inside that causes levitate. Chalamet's character is characterized by a long purple coat, vest, ascot, and rumpled top hat. Willy's dream is to bring the wonder of his candy to everyone in the world, bringing his passion for chocolate to life.","

"Wonka","moonspinner55","17 December 2023","The background story of candy-maker Willy Wonka, a child magician-turned-chocolate lover who arrives in a thriving metropolis and immediately runs afoul of lying/cheating/thieving chocolate sovereign Arthur Slugworth. Wonka (an illiterate!) is railroaded by evil hoteliers and is sentenced to work in the washer-room, where he befriends an urchin and conspires to usurp Slugworth with his delicious chocolates made with giraffe's milk. This CGI nightmare from director Paul King--targeted at restless kids raised on Taylor Swift videos--opens with the tinkling notes of ""Pure Imagination"" from 1971's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (and goes on to use that song plus ""The Oompa-Loompa Song""). That's a nice touch, yet the dreary action that takes place down in the dark brown-and-beige washer-room is enlivened only by the ""Scrub Scrub"" number. The plot, concocted by King and Simon Farnaby from King's original treatment, isn't involving: Wonka escapes to open his own shop--across the square from Slugworth's building--only to have his candy poisoned, causing the crowds to turn on him and burn the place down (the urchin solemnly tells Willy, ""We can rebuild"", while the audience likely asks, ""Can't that wait for the sequel?""). King's sense of humor is of the dryly dubious kind found in today's kids' movies, wherein wonderment and magic are greeted with eye-rolling skepticism. When crowds gather (and they do--at regular intervals), no one is overly-surprised when magic chocolates make Slugworth and his flunkies levitate. This is a movie about wonderment without any wonder in it--the whiplash editing eliminates it. In the lead, red-nosed Timothée Chalamet doesn't possess a strong singing or speaking voice--nor, indeed, a strong visual presence (he's forgettable in the role). Some of the supporting players are marginally better, though the casting of Paterson Joseph as the lips-pursing Slugworth doesn't pay off (he's whispery-intimidating but drip-dry and vacant, like the pimps in the blaxploitation movies). The CGI will probably please those who can't get along without it, but it looks cheap when focusing on Hugh Grant as Wonka's chocolate-stealing nemesis; we can't get an idea of this Oompa-Loompa's size, which seems to change, nor his personality (he's brash and yet benign). The intermittent musical numbers give the film a bit of a lift, but not enough, and a vengeful plan for Wonka that lands him in a rising pool of chocolate (""Death by chocolate!"") puts a damper on the whole thing. ** from ****","

"Wonka","qjxsfpqd","6 January 2024","The movie was absolutely bad. Don't get me wrong, I really like the original movies, but this one... I didn't even realize it was a musical at first and by the time I figured it out after the first few songs, it was over for me. I don't even think it was necessary to make a musical out of it. Not even Chalamet was as good in this movie as he normally is. The plot made absolutely no sense, the jokes were nowhere near funny, some of the songs were so bad that I was about to walk out of the theater. I was definitely not the only one who thought that.In my opinion, the movie was only made for the money, not to tell a good story. Wasted money and brain cells, don't watch it if you don't want to waste your time.","

"Wonka","lakonur","9 December 2023","In this latest film, it's clear that something vital is missing. Despite the commendable efforts of a talented cast, they struggle against a script that is both boring and predictable. Their performance, while earnest, cannot elevate the lackluster storyline.The music, often a redeeming feature in such films, sadly fails to deliver. It doesn't capture the audience's interest or invite participation. There's a noticeable lack of catchy tunes or engaging rhythms, making the musical aspect forgettable.Targeted at families, the film surprisingly doesn't resonate with children. The humor is limited and mostly revealed in the trailers, leaving little to be discovered in the theater. The sporadic laughs from the younger viewers are few and far between, indicating the film's failure to connect with its intended audience.A key element missing is the enchanting and quirky charm typically associated with ""Wonka movies."" This film follows a too straightforward and mundane path, lacking the vibrancy and uniqueness that made previous films stand out. Overall, it's a disappointing experience that lacks the magic and personality needed to make it memorable.","

From poor references to Gene Wilders Wonka, terrible cgi, and for some reason a well known actor who keeps switching accents back and forth, to a bad plot as well... overall not a movie I would recommend. Also, why wasn't it advertised as a music, because it is. A bad one, but a musical nonetheless. If you're not a fan of the Johnny Depp adaptation you will not enjoy this for sure.

"Wonka","dan_slentz","19 December 2023","Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (12/16/23): ""Wonka"". First thing to know is to NOT expect either previous version of the movie related to the character. It's neither Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp's version. It's not about a kid coming to the factory after getting a gold ticket. Nothing like that.. so don't expect it. This is Willy's return after going to Oompa Loompa Land and wanting to start making chocolate. Knowing that will help you by not having wrong expectations. In this case, Willie goes up against a ""gang of three different chocolatiers"" (one is Slugworth).The movie is worth seeing.. and it's a movie event, but be aware that it certainly feels more like a stage play in some respect as the acting is ""big"".. as if exaggerated and animated, as if it's being played TO an audience.Timothee Chalamet does a nice job as Willy Wonka, but he fortunately doesn't have the craziness of Depp's Wonka, but neither quite the warmth or interesting appeal as Wilder's Wonka. Don't expect Wilder or Depp's Wonkas, and that will also help your expectations.Though this isn't a musical, there's a fair bit of music and songs in this new version. Some of the music is a bit campy, but some of the music and songs WILL bring back fond memories of the Gene Wilder version of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".I can say that for about the first half of the movie, I really wasn't enjoying this new version of the movie much.. but after about half way through the movie, I started to like and appreciate this movie for what IT is, and not what it isn't (which is like the other two).As I said, do NOT expect the previous other two Wonka movies and look for something completely new. If you go into it and keep a ""clean slate"" image and appreciate it as a brand new movie, I think you'll like it more.Only other note is that Chalamet sings in the movie, and he's not bad, but he's also not as good as an actor like Hugh Jackman (who is an actor who is also an excellent singer.. and other similar actors with well-trained singing voices).The story line is a good one, and the acting is very good by Wonka and the others who are ""in debt"" (you'll understand if/when you see the movie), but the actors portraying the chocolatiers and police are more like the over-acting characters from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (cartoonish in their over-acting). I'd give this movie a 6.2 and say that it's definitely worth seeing.. and seeing on a big screen. I think if the director had taken this movie a little less ""Chitty Chitty-ish"", I would be up in the mid 7 rating... or even a little higher. Go see Wonka at the theater!","

To the contrary, this movie was a nostalgic treat! For fans of the original film you will see scenes that explain Wonka's character and even sets the stage for Charlie Bucket in the future. It was imaginative, entertaining and a great film for the whole family. It does justice to this beloved eccentric character who so many of us grew up watching. If you enjoyed the original, I think you'll like this one too. Highly recommend.","

"Wonka","HeydarEntertainment","4 January 2024","This Movie was good, it had some good elements in it, a little plot twist and some good writing, humor, but it had too much singing! That ruined my experience, the old one (1971) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory will be a timeless Classic it had humor and more and also some music elements but there weren't that many and they went by very fast. This is going to be a Hard one. I'll give it a 5-6 out of 10. (PS: J watched the Movie in German because I live in Germany). Wonka was an interesting Prequel, it made me laugh sometimes and was very interesting. This Review was Spoiler Free :) Event though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a Success and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was too doesn't mean it needs another Movie, Warner Bros.-Power is a gift, do not abuse it.-Roald Dahl (13.

"Wonka","christopher-19951","4 January 2024","This new film adaptation of Wonka left me soo disappointed; it falls short of expectations. The musical aspect felt lacking, deviating significantly from the original's darker themes. It seemed to stray far from the essence that Wonka fans hold dear. This movie just felt way more fantastical and like some Dr Suess alternate universe with Wonka. The plot dragged on unnecessarily, making me wish it could have been wrapped up in a concise 30 minutes. The Oompa Loompas' appearance was underwhelming, and the heavy reliance on CGI made the viewing experience challenging. While I understand it's geared towards children, the cringy comedy and lengthy storyline might test even their attention spans. Although Timothée's singing voice didn't resonate with me, there were a few moments that brought some laughter- (all independently from the movie, I was laughing at it, not with it). In summary, the film turned out to be a mediocre experience for me.","

Scrub -scrub, in for a penny, in for a whole box of chocolates.It's definitely Dahl not dull, Harry Potter with humour and Hugo with chocolate. Being confronted by the shop steward from Made in Dagenham, the Vicar from Four Weddings, the butler from Downtown, Matt from Little Britain and Hugh Grant from everywhere- it's not plain chocolate. Timothee Chalamet with one of those grave things I can't find on my phone and Calah Lane as Noodle were super whilst vulnerable and likeable as the leads.The pair that stole the show with the fantastic nasty parts were Olivia Coleman and Tom Davis as Scrubbit and Bleaker romping through their unfriendly guest house. The use of CGI was hilarious and colourful, just amazing with the sets. Music was fab despite the fact I hate musicals. ! Hats off to director Paul King. Yes we know he had a massive 125 million dollars budget even allowing him to shoot in Watford- he created a great film for all ages and backgrounds. Oops and watch out for Hugh as an orange man with green hair.","

To do so you actually have to be Roald Dahl.Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is rich in satire. In this film Wonka there's none, nor any ironically funny characters like Veruca Salt, Mike TeeVee etc. The method acting is also rather annoying in that it's hardly appropriate for what is essentially a kids' fairy storyThis film is well designed and well acted, but not exactly original (I've see all the plot elements elsewhere.)Still, it's recommended as light and fluffy fun if you're in a tolerant frame of mind, but I can't think of a funny line.","

"Wonka","chand-suhas","7 December 2023","Willy Wonka's origin story puts him in London, where he wants to make his long dream come true. With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain.","

I was very sceptical of what this may be like. I was surprised and delighted with this film. I think anyone who is very familiar with Roald's work will see that the creators of this really understand how he wrote and why and have honoured his brilliance in respectful and intelligent ways. Yes sure it's a total fantasy and quite silly, but once you tune in with that and allow yourself to enjoy what it is it is a great ride. Some songs are irritating and a bit poor but others are beautifully written and really funny. What this film really excels at is the delightful design of everything, if you enjoy that in a film you will love the world created here it is beautiful, magical, ingenious and spectacular. The score is also very nicely woven and had me a bit teary a few times. I really admire how it has been linked in many ways to the original, respectfully and tastefully. It goes without saying the cast is brilliant. Watch it. It's lovely.","

This is one of them.From the writing/Directing partnership behind Paddington 2 comes Willy Wonka's backstory full of whimsy, laughs and 1st class music and songs.Here we see the titular character arrive in the unspecified vaguely Germanic country of the original film where he's tricked into a life of servitude by Tom Davis and Olivia Colman's wonderfully hissable laundry owners. Here he meets his fellow serfs but sets about founding his confectionery empire in the face of some stiff competition led by the brilliant Paterson Jospeh as well as leading his friends to freedom.The songs by the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon and Joby Talbot are a particular high point, with For A Moment easily the best of the bunch. Chalamet is a great, wide eyed and slightly mad early incarnation of the chocolatier with a singing voice to match.Some beautiful set pieces and lots of laughs make this a top class festive treat.","

"Wonka","oliverwilkins1","7 January 2024","Roald Dahl was renowned as a storyteller so a character driven take on Willy Wonka's coming of age was always going to be a challenging task and for me this has to go down as a failure.Firstly it must be said this is not the fault of the lead actor who plays a believable and authentic young Wonka. Nor indeed the assemble cast including notable funny interludes from Hugh Grant and Rowen Atkinson to name just two.The costumes were also exceptional and one of my real highlights. However the fundamental story and storytelling was really muddled and the basic principle of a musical, that the musical interludes augment and advance the plot was missing, forgivable if songs themselves are catchy and not entirely forgettable.Wonka tries to set itself in a magical world. One where it can go from snowy wonderland to balmy summer nights from scene to scene. Where Wonka himself is the arbiter of magic in the form of chocolate. Want to fly? There's a chocolate for that! Want to be inspired? Guess what, there's a chocolate for that too.But get trapped in a formulaic predicament not of your making? Well suddenly you've only got your good old fashioned wits to rely on. It doesn't make sense.One could argue that it's not supposed to make sense, it is about magical chocolate after all. Which is probably the best argument to make. It's just it doesn't sit right with me. The joy of the chocolate factory, is that the magic was held within it, it was limited. By letting the genie out of the lamp and having unlimited wishes they've removed the suspense, the wonderment and the drama.","

"Wonka","chenp-54708","9 December 2023","It's a decent origin story about the character of Willy Wonka with good performances, beautiful production, musical tracks, and some good humor. Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading. Overall, it's definitely not the best movie from Paul King but it's still entertaining with fun visuals and a good time to watch for the Christmas Season. Now time to eat some chocolate.","

His color inspirations and drive backed by a lack of common sense defines his name.The creative uses of candy and colorful creations are enough to inspire anyone.

"Wonka","teddabread2","29 December 2023","When I heard that there was going to be a prequel to the first two Willy Wonka movies I got very excited! It was also quite exciting to see a new actor that i've heard a lot about that plays Wonka in this movie. Timothée Chalamet.I didn't know a lot about this actor except that he was quite famous and had been in a lot of famous movies like Dune, Little Women, Bones and All, Don't Look Up and more popular movies. Matter of fact, this was my first movie that I saw with Timothée Chalamet being a big actor in it, also the first movie I saw that had him in it. No offence, but i didn't think that he would have the right personality to success like for example the Johnny Depp Wonka. But oh boy. This movie was actually REALLY good!Positives:The acting is good.The dialogue is good.The musical is good.The cinematography is good.The CGI is quite good.The characters are likeable.The villains are actually VERY good, same with the heroes.The movie has some cool scenes and themes.The jokes/comedy in the movie is MOST of the time a bit funny even for an older audience, and DEFINITELY very good for a younger audience!Timothée Chalamet as Wonka is actually a pretty good choice, he also has some nice musical skills. It would be nice to see a sequel of this movie with Timothée playing Wonka once again and Noodle being in the story of the movie too, once again, they are a good team for the movie and are pretty likeable characters that make you root for them.The movie has a good runtime.The movie has a good pace.The movie has some good and SURPRISING actors in the movie like Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Tom Davis, Simon Farnaby and more!If you pay a lot of attention in the movie, and if you've seen both Paddington movies, then theres a high chance that you'll recognise 4 actors, more or less, that different actors have been in one Paddington movie, or both!The fantasy in the movie is very good.The movie is very wholesome and definitely keeps you focused with the charming tone and theme to the movie that matches with the movie being a musical.Most of the movies surprising actors are actually VERY good for not only being in Mr. Bean or the Johnny English movies (like Rowan Atkinson), but also for the Paddington actors that surprisingly ALSO fit good into this movie!The movie still manages to keep that Willy Wonka style to it and doesn't only do it in a, ""Welcome to my chocolate factory!"" Way and then some troubling moments happen to some people in the movie.However, THIS movie manages to keep a creative and DIFFERENT idea to it as well as a much more different plot compared to the other Willy Wonka movies. And it works VERY well!The movie is creative and unique.Negatives:The comedy in this movie sometimes isn't that funny and falls flat if you're watching this as an older audience.It feels like some of the actors in the movie don't try to have their absolute BEST charm to them.Timothée Chalamet sometimes in this movie doesn't really have that ""I am Willy Wonka!"" Feeling to him and more has that ""I am a person who can make magical chocolate!"". I mean. It's creative and all, but he doesn't really match that well for especially that Johnny Depp Willy Wonka style. That weird, funny and confused person which is the personality that Johnny Depp's try in being Willy Wonka had.The movie sometimes doesn't have singing in like very PERFECT opportunities which is quite sad and ruins a bit of the moment.Sometimes the CGI in the movie is quite obvious, but otherwise it's very good.Overall this movie is VERY good and MUCH better than I expected! Even if you aren't that big of a fan when it comes to Musicals you'll still have a big chance to like this movie, especially if you like Willy Wonka and want to have some originality which is a quite different story to the other Willy Wonka movies. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie!","

"Wonka","rannynm","9 December 2023","Wonka is an amazing movie! This film, directed by Paul King, is a feel-good musical that took me on a very emotional ride. Viewers learn the origin story of the eccentric chocolatier and magician.Willy (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the Gallery Gourmet but quickly runs out of money. He meets Bleacher (Tom Davis), who introduces Willy to Mrs. Scrubbitt (Olivia Colman), who tricks him into a contract and forces him to work in her laundry room to pay off his debt. There he meets other indentured workers - Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Noodle (Calah Lane) becomes Willy's closest ally and joins him to defeat the corrupt Chocolate Cartel and reach his goal of opening a chocolate shop.I never expected to feel so many emotions in a Willy Wonka movie. There is the familiar magicalness of Willy who whips up the most amazing chocolate and candy confections, like Hoverchocs that can make you fly. Yet the performances, musical score and art direction really pulled me into the story. The song, ""Pure Imagination,"" appears in different versions throughout the film and adds to the emotional experience. I really like the character development and the sibling-like friendship between Willy and Noodle. When Willy agrees to secretly leave town to free his friends, Timothée Chalamet's singing of ""Sorry Noodle"" had me crying my eyes out. The evilness of the Chocolate Cartel led by Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph) had me so angry as they repeatedly try to defeat Willy and they eventually trap Willy and Noodle. My favorite part is when the Oompa Loompa Lofty (Hugh Grant) saves Willy and Noodle from being drowned in chocolate.The message of Wonka is to let your imagination run wild and keep striving for your dreams even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, the struggle will be worth it, especially if you have friends to share your success with.I give Wonka 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The film will be released in theaters on December 15, 2023. By Kira O., KIDS FIRST!","

"Wonka","samuelc_goldman-45076","24 January 2024","The film should have been called ""Noodle"".Not Wonka.Or perhaps the adventures of ""Noodle & Wonka"".The film is more about a girl finding her true self and building character through the friendship she forms with Wonka.So if you're expecting a Charlie or Wonka vibrant movie taking the original to the next level to dazzle and amaze, you will be dissapointed.The last 90 seconds of the film is the best part of the entire movie as it shows what the film could have been. It could have been bright and fun throughout.But instead they went with a negative and dark tone.Still, the main actor was terrific as Wonka.","

The story line was very simple which i apprecaited for this movie. I did not need a complex story line simple wonka wanted to help and sell chocolate and had to overcome obsticales with a dream that made wonka extremly lovable. Overall the scenes were very over the top but it worked for this movie. I really enjoyed it under the timefrane and really was a feel good christmas movie. This was an incredible prequel and would easily want to see more.","

I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't enjoy watching any of the characters! Wonka wasn't a poor child who lived with a poor single mother, and certainly wasn't a magician with an endless portal hat! He was a child of a rich dentist who didn't let willy eat chocolate because of his teeth. This movie is for kids that's right but writers could stick to original story at least. It was totally a waste of time. Made me miss the original one with lovely Johnny Depp.","

"Wonka","vinsond21","8 December 2023","Finally, we can close this unremarkable year with a magical dose of Wonka, which will hopefully wash away the bad memories of the plasticity of Barbie and dreariness of Oppenheimer from the summer.Timothee Chalamet sings effortlessly the songs with clever lyrics by Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. Give the Oscars to them both already.The production design and art direction provide a dazzling visual feast, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.For better or worse, Willy Wonka here is presented as sweet and warm and lovable although we know him as a much darker personality as played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in the films based on Roald Dahl's book. This is the back story, so I guess he started off more innocently. But I still can't get over Timothee Chalamet's absolutely flawless performance. In this very challenging role which includes singing, his speech and demeanor are pitch perfect.So happy to end this dismal year on such a fabulous note!","

There was a song every 3 seconds, and they were not even good and took attention away from the actual plot. I also wanted to watch this movie because I thought it would be about wonka giving away the factory but it wasn't even about that. The actors were not good either and the plot wasn't good either. All in all there could have been major improvements to the song, plot, and the actor in the movie. I wound not recommend this movie to anyone and left the movie too.

They had all the ingredients to make a truly scrumptious film -instead it's an inedible mess. The story is weak, the songs are forgettable and it is NOT an origin story.There are so many cameos from class actors and Timotheé Chalamet does the best he can with a really weak story.I've been left wondering who the film was for. It was too sugary sweet for kids and adults. It's nothing like as good as Paddington 2 which worked on many levels. Watch the Gene Wilder one instead.","

The 2005 edition with Johnny Depp was okay but compared to this film it is a masterpiece of epic proportion.Chalamet does not do a great job as the titular character, it feels like he was overacting constantly. The story is strange and is hard to follow. The visuals may look attractive to some but personally I found them nauseating. The songs are terrible and forgettable, and there is an unnecessary amount of them. Very very few jokes land.Hugh Grant does an ok job but others did not perform here.Don't waste your money seeing this.","

"Wonka","cricketbat","13 March 2024","I was not excited to see Wonka because I didn't think Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory needed a prequel. I still think it doesn't, but Wonka is not exactly the origin story of the beloved 1971 family film. This movie hides out in another corner of the Wonkaverse and it is kind of its own thing. I liked Timothée Chalamet's character, but I kept wondering if this story would have been stronger if he were not Willy Wonka. I also think using Hugh Grant as a CG-Oompa Loompa is a mistake. The filmmaking recipe is definitely more seasoned for children, but I enjoyed Wonka more than I thought I would.","

've never walked out of the cinema before but I was very close to it. The whole movie from start to finish was irritating and infuriating. Timothy Chalamaet Is not right for the part. There's no eccentricity or edginess to his character. He is not fit to lace Wilders boots. His sidekick noodle Is more wooden then my kitchen table.she has zero charisma. The entire English cast are overacting and beyond irritating. The musical scores must have been written by a 5 year old. Scrub scrub scrub. I'll scrub this movie out of my head very quickly.Nothing happens in the whole movie.its bland and soul less. I'm amazed by some of the rave reviews.

The use of ridiculously stereotyped British people in the form of the 2 hotel proprietors that essentially kidnap Wonka into slavery really made me hate every minute they were on screen, which was way too much time. And not because they were playing deplorable people, but because the film no longer felt any semblance of real with their over the top portrayals. The music itself was also quite a step down from the originals music. The only saving grace of this film was Hugh Grant and he's barely in the film. The whimsy of Wonka as played by Chalamet was uncomfortable and plain weird to watch at times.","

"Wonka","SAMTHEBESTEST","6 December 2023","Wonka (2023) :
Movie Review -Wonka Review: So you must have read Roal Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (1964); you must have seen Gene Wilder's blockbuster ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) and then Tom Burton-Johnny Depp's mega hit ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005), so now it's time for Timothée Chalamet's origin story of Willy Wonka with ""Wonka"" (2023). It's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. It's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. That's it. You have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. Comedy lover Paul King gets it right. Paul understood the assignment well. Wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.Wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in Wilder and Depp's movies. There you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. He isn't settled yet, though. Rather, he hasn't started his career. He keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. Since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even ""poor"" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. They try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. Amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, Wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. With the help of Noodle/Nicole (Calah Lane) and other imprisoners, Wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.First of all, Paul King has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. The humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of Wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. The musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. Wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. In the end, we see Wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. We are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to Paul King for writing one that lives up to expectations. We had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. I think that's just dandy. I was craving; I was drooling for chocolates by the end, and I wish I could enter the screen just like Mia Farrow did it in Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. It's so freaking tasty.Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka. I wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder, but yes, he is our Willy Wonka, alright. If those generations remember Wilder and Depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember Chalamet. Calah Lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. Paterson Joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. There is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton (that yuk ""poor"" joke was so rich) support him well. Keegan-Michael Key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. Our favourite Mr. Bean, Rowan Atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? I mean, it's so hilarious to know. The first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. Jim Carter, Tom Davis, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar, Rich Fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.Joby Talbot's songs have made Wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. I was tapping my feet, and I didn't even realise it. Mark Everson's editing has literally no flaws. The only scene that looked slow and dated was when Noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. Chung-hoon Chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. Roald Dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and Paul King has given us that. Action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what Paul serves you on the table in no time. Scrumptious is the word! ""You've never tasted chocolate like this,"" says Wonka in one of the songs, and I can assure you that he really meant it. This chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. There is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.RATING - 6/10*","

"Wonka","Couchkik20","11 December 2023","Wonka is an amazing piece of entertainment reminiscent of old Hollywood when spectacle and awe truly meant something.The secret is that it is a cartoon made in live action. The tone, the musicality, the over-the-top acting and characters, everything has the sweetness and joy of an animated movie.The story is the emotional and musical journey of a very naive but smart character in the true spirit of Roal Dahl. It blends humor, drama and a baroque sense of insanity that wraps you with childlike excitement.Timothée Chalamet nails the complex Wonka by playing it in all seriousness and embracing the silliness like a male Mary Poppins.Paul King uses the 1940s love of dramatic shots, crazy colors and retro choreographies to fill his movie with fascinating set pieces. The shop scene is fabulous and just an example of the incredible attention to details : the right combination of digital and reality. Disney could learn a thing or two from it. Of course if you're familiar with the Paddington movies you will recognize story beats, aesthetic elements and an obsession with heist scenarios but it works for the best. As an incredible rollercoaster of old school fun,
Wonka will melt your heart.","

"Wonka","superfox_888","22 December 2023","I LOVED the first half hour! It was magical, wonderful, Wonkatastic.Then it died soon after plot point 1 signalling Act 2. I should have listened to Hugh Grant's complaints about the film. It gets bogged in melodramatic sentimentality with forgettable songs. Reminded me of Hugh Jackman's The Greatest Showman at times. Every great idea starts as a dream, and there's no shortage of big ideas and daydreams here.Timothee Chalomet is a competent Wonka, but the dialogue did no favours. He'd say a Wonka-ism like, ""scratch that, reverse it""... and never utter it again. The other characters are forgettable sidekicks. As far as I can see, the Oompa Loompa was included just for continuity's sake and holds no narrative purpose. As mentioned Hugh Grant has been quite vocal in his criticism, saying he only took the role for the money. As an Oompa Loompa, I quite liked him.On the way out of the cinema, I listened to people around me. Not one kid liked it. A couple of adults did. Most just wanted chocolate.","

"Wonka","farthingtonwisemore","2 January 2024","Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet's performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.The film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothy Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.One has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.","

the sequel it was advertised to be when there's no perceivable way from this story to evolve into any version of the original story.The musical numbers are weaker even than the casting. The entire movie plays out like a cheap stage production in which none of the actors wanted to perform.There was no need to retell wonka's story to make him a sad, likeable type when the entire original concept leans heavily on his dark nature and outright insanity.

"Wonka","r96sk","13 December 2023","Enjoyed this!2023's 'Wonka' is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.Timothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.Someone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.All in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).","

"Wonka","Snootz","27 January 2024","With a current 7.6 approval rating it's evident the general audience liked this film. I usually very much enjoy family films. But I have to admit I found this a bit underwhelming.The only actor I really liked was Calah Lane, who played Noodle. The other actors just weren't given much script to work with.The songs were disappointing and the choreography worse. Add to that the general dismal and depressing sets, and there's very little in this that felt like Willie Wonka.The villains were cliche, the authorities corrupt, and the ""wonder"" of Wonka really wasn't that wondrous. What was seriously lacking was the sense of mystery that was in the original film, the eerie feeling that Wonka was just a little... odd.The main actor (Wonka) didn't really impress me in performance, singing or dancing. Of course that could be because the songs and choreography were sub-standard to begin with.In the end the film just barely held my attention, which really surprised me. I was expecting to sit down and fully enjoy this, but simply didn't. It was a disappointing presentation of a beloved character and simply didn't live up to expectations.I'm glad people generally enjoyed it. But I feel this could have been a whole lot better, especially with today's movie making tools and by today's standards. This felt like a cheaply-made film from the 90s, and that definitely wasn't what was expected.","

"Wonka","Bibliophile100","15 December 2023","Just got back from this on its opening release date with my Mom! I absolutely ADORED it!!!The story: Willy Wonka, a magician/inventor/chocolatier arrives in an old English city with a happy hopeful dream: selling chocolate and spreading magic and happiness to all of the townsfolk! However, three other pride and greed infested chocolatiers, Ficklegruber, Prodnose, and Slugworth (collectively knows as The Chocolate Cartel) are instantly consumed with jealousy and annoyance at Wonka's work, and decide to try and crush his dreams. Luckily, with a group of wishy-washy washers from a hard labored laundry business, Wonka might have just the friends he needs to succeed, and make his Mama proud!The cast was an excellent, interesting choice of actors; each actor had the perfect mood to fit their character in different situations in the film. I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and Olivia Colman's performances the best; they really made me laugh!The film had a nice lighthearted, cheery, and humorous tone to it. A little something for adults, and children. I felt constant giddiness throughout the film! Sets and effects were pretty neat as well. The musical numbers, were outstanding! For each situation in the film, there was an excellent song to go with it! My favorite songs were ""You've never had a Chocolate like This"", and ""A World of your Own"". Plus, as respect payment for the 1971 version, the Oompa-Loompa song, and ""Pure Imagination"" were also featured, with brand new clever lyrics!Overall, this was one of the most happy, funny, exciting, descriptive, detailed, and clever musicals I've ever seen!! I've never felt such giddiness, joy, cheerfulness, and happiness at the movie theater before!! I actually felt like I was a kid again, skipping down the theater steps with my Mom, still singing ""A World of your Own"". I truly cherished Wonka! DON'T miss it!!

And, if you're going to remake one of the most beloved movies of all time, you better make sure you're doing it REALLY well.Well, that's where this movie easily fails. The original movie was a lot of fun for both adults and kids. This one is more for children. The songs are forgettable, the lead actor is OK but most of the other actors were not. The cast is completely forgettable. I could not tell you one of the actors names, or the real names besides the lead. They were that uninteresting.All in all of this is an easy pass.

"Wonka","Tweetienator","26 February 2024","Well, Wonka is not the worst movie nor the worst musical on this planet, but, and this is a great but, it lacks of really good and catchy songs and magic - the story and characters are rather shallow cartoons and predictable and neither the direction nor the cast can fill them with life (at least not much). Solid is the production value with some eye candy here and there. All in all not a total crash, but nothing I will (presumably) ever watch again. Like many productions/movies these days, Wonka just feels forced, rather redundant, generic, even boring sometimes. Both movie adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, Tim Burton) that I know, are superior to this one easily - by miles.","

"Wonka","Boristhemoggy","7 February 2024","With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.Remember this is an origin movie, exploring Wonka's young life, and not remaking the original film. This review could be long, so if you just want a nutshell review, here we go:
Is it fun? At times, yes.Will I enjoy it? If you concentrate on the bits you like, yes.Is it worth the price of a cinema ticket? No.Will it get an Oscar? Absolutely not.Now, Wonka has been given a great cast. It's obviously benefitted from a huge budget. ($125,000,000) The CGI is very good, but not quite faultless. The story is great, and definitely worthy of a decent film telling.However...
Timothy Chalamet looks the part, but at his young age he simply does not have the ability to act with his voice and his face and body, as well as a seasoned actor. Also his singing is excruciatingly ordinary, and the songs were not even close to films such as The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins. I can't even remember a single song and the film has only finished 3 hours ago. He was pretty flat, carrying out every scene in the same way without ever showing anything but that smile. It really felt like he was just along for the ride and not invested in the story. He clearly failed to understand the character of Wonka properly and that showed in his performance. I think he was badly cast, he's not yet ready for a role like this. Or, maybe he was just poorly directed?If you are going to make a musical you must make the songs tuneful, and memorable. Not one song in Wonka is either of those things, and because Chalamet's singing isn't great, it fails as a musical.I dislike Olivia Colman, but it is fair to say her performance was one of the best in the film. She magically brought the character of Mrs Scrubitt to life and was one of the standout performances of the film. Pure acting talent, nothing more to be said.I've never heard of Paterson Joseph but as Slugworth he struck a brilliant balance between bad guy, and almost-comic book character. I could easily become a fan of his. He wasn't given the easiest part of the three chocolatiers, but his performance was very decent unlike the other two who I honestly felt presenetd as out of their depth amateurs.Keegan-Michael Kay was another decent performance as the Chief of Police. He nailed the part of bumbling fool, but without being completely silly and slapstick childish.I felt an affinity for the characters indebted by Mrs Scrubitt, mostly because of their predicament. But had we not been told they were indebted I would not have guessed as they seemed to be happy and lived cleanly and were well fed. None of that indebtedness really rang true but the characters were played well anyway.The rest of the cast slipped between average and really poor, and I have no idea if that's down to acting ability or direction. I suspect the former as Colman was so great in her part. Sally Hawkins shone in her tiny role, and I wonder why such a fabulous actress was given such a teeny part? It really doesn't make sense.The script was odd. I found odd sayings such as ""everyone being on the same page"" slipped into the dialogue and that really timestamps a film. There were a cluster of dialogue faux pas' such as that and I felt they had been put in there to satisfy people who like that nonsense kind of talk. Overall the script wasn't bad, but it failed to light up situations and people. There was nothing at all that I felt moved me or touched me, and I took nothing memorable from it.It's made about $570,000,000 which isn't a huge amount for a film like that about a much beloved story. I suspect many who remember Gene Wilder bringing Wonka to life were expecting something almost as good as that film. But while people new to Wonka might enjoy it on some level, and I very much expect many to do that, it falls flat as part of the Wonka World.Overall I don't think it's a bad watch, especially if you're not familiar with Willy Wonka, or if you are a Chalamet fan, but I am glad I dind't pay for a cinema ticket, and I won't be watching it again.","

"Wonka","cruise01","17 December 2023","2.5 out of 5 stars.Wonka is a pretty bad fantasy musical film that is an origin story to Willy Wonka. And how he came to be before he made his factory. Starting off poor. Coming across greedy and corrupt chocolatiers.Plot is decent. Timothee Chalamet did a great job with the performance. The script is cheesy. The humor is tacky and more aiming for the children audience. The musical sequences i did find to be quite forgettable. It was hard to feel emotional with the characters. Fans of Willy Wonka will enjoy this film more. With its magical direction. Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa. And the cheesy humor.","

I didn't had high hopes for Wonka and I was not dissapointed.Everything is just great in this film. The cast was awesome, Thimothee Chalament was so great as Willy Wonka and Rowan Atkinson, Keegan Miachel Key, Hugh Grant were great. With this lovely performance I think Timothee Chalament is the best Wonka.I'm really glad that Paul King (director of Paddington 1 and 2) directed this movie because he truly does know how to make a family movie.Wonka is a magical, fun, and a heartwarming movie I seen so far and it's a Christmas film.","

"Wonka","b5fanatic","31 January 2024","Just saw Wonka. It's okay. But it's nothing like the Roald Dahl book. Nothing at all. It's like little orphan Annie, complete with most of her story in the og movie in the 80s, almost down to every plot line except the daddy warbucks. The orphan even delivers laundry and sneaks people in and out like Annie in the movie.And the horrible woman that owns her drinks gin. Sound familiar? She meets the magic chocolate man. I don't know why they didn't just call it Annie Meets The Magic Chocolatier. Though mildly entertaining, it's got none of the karma that Dahl brings and none of the comedy that Annie had. It's not very funny, and it's not very enchanting. It's meh.","

"Wonka","ThereelscoopwithKK","28 December 2023","This may be my favourite movie of 2023. Based on the trailer I had very low expectations. Thankfully, unlike most trailers nowadays, it saved a lot of its juice for the actual film. The casting for this movie was perfection. Each character brings a magic to their role necessary to make this kind of film work.I was a bit concerned with the opening scene leading off immediately with a song and wondering if I'd just gone to a movie solely meant for 5 year olds. However, it sets the stage for the rest of what is a beautifully crafted family movie with excellent messaging and characters that grow on you more and more as the movie develops. The role of Wonka had high demands and Timothée Chalamet meets them. He's charming and his demeanour fits that of a young Gene Wilder version of Wonka. The supporting cast and villains are spectacular as well. There was no point where I felt bored or felt that scenes were included that didn't serve a purpose.Perhaps the best asset this movie has is that it has natural unforced comedy. So much of what's meant to be funny nowadays in movies is just so bland or overused. Wonka offers something new I haven't seen in years.Overall Wonka combines excellent character development, comedic relief, plot development, strong visuals, and a magical setting which only further elevates the superb performances. Most films these days are lucky if they are able to achieve just 2 of the above in one film.Huge thumbs up to all involved in the creation of this movie. Prequels are almost always a let down , but this one hits just right.See it in theatres if you can !","

"Wonka","Elvis-Del-Valle","12 December 2023","Years after Gene Wilder brought Willy Wonka to the big screen for the first time and after Johnny Depp played him, now the beloved chocolatier returns to recount his beginnings before creating the chocolate factory. The film tells a charming story that manages to maintain the essence of the 1971 film and update it in an excellent way. He presents us with an innocent and charming Willy Wonka who has that charisma and eccentricity that so characterizes the character. The movie shows Willy as a kind of magician and that's what he's always been since he first appeared in Roald Dahl's book or the original movie. Without a doubt, the actor manages to maintain the eccentricity of the character. Hugh Grant plays the first Oompa-Loompa that Willy met and the way he embodies this peculiar character is wonderful, making him striking. Even though short real actors were used in the original film and CGI was used here, they managed to keep the Oompa-Loompa's appearance and quirkiness intact. The film's musical numbers are a work of art and have the feel of the original film's soundtrack, making the musical scenes masterful. It is quite appreciated that some parts of the original soundtrack were also used. The acting, the production, the special effects, literally everything in this film is excellent, managing to respect the vision of the source of origin and making it a worthy successor to Dahl's work for perfectly capturing its magic. Wonka is definitely one of the best prequels in cinema history and a beautiful film to enjoy with the whole family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.","

"Wonka","grigoraaakis-889-295918","27 December 2023","A very imaginative origin story of the beloved character. There is something peculiar about ""Wonka"" in that it is an origin story but we really do not get to see much of him and his travels around the globe. There's still so much mystery left surrounding his character. Other than that, Timothée Chalamet is charming and absolutely fitting in the lead role. His charisma and charm are doing wonders for the movie. Many side characters and many of them not fully realised. Olivia Colman is having real fun playing the hideous villain of the story. Hugh Grant shines as the Oompa Loompa. This was pure fun, filled with joy and magic. ""Wonka"" brings nothing new to the character of Willy Wonka but still is a fun adventure!","

"Wonka","roncarrpurdue","4 January 2024","Timothée Chalamet should not have been cast in a musical. His one note performance ruined what potentially could have been a good movie had someone who could sing have been cast in the role. I wanted to leave after the first song but stuck it out and did get to hear him hit a couple of notes in the final song, so I'm not sure why they couldn't have done that throughout. The best scenes were towards the end when the technical production was kicked up a notch. Hugh Grant probably stuck out as my favorite character. The three antagonists were pretty annoying, which, I guess is appropriate for antagonists.","

"Wonka","tm-sheehan","14 December 2023","My Review- Wonka
My Score 6/10I don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but I felt that Roald Dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.I'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as I enjoyed Timothée Chalamet's characterisation of young Willy Wonker pre his Chocolate factory I was bored .Even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular I kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .I kept thinking I've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like Oliver or Annie .The plot is very different to Roald Dahl's backstory to Willy Wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. This unfortunately made Willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.In this Wonker movie Willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed European city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious Mrs. Scrubbit and her henchman Bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.The three other villains are three chocolatiers named Mr. Slugworth, Mr. Prodnose and Mr. Fickelgruber who mock Wonka's chocolates .They scheme together and call the corrupt Chief of Police to confiscate Willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.Wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed I hope it does but it didn't with me and I really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?I doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and I also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.I enjoyed the 2 Paddington movies that Simon Farnaby and Paul King who also is the director of Wonker made but I feel have missed the mark in this movie .To many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . Perhaps it just that Roald Dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by David Greig, music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman.Joby Talbot the composer of Wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that I'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley score for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory which produced The Candy Man and Pure Imagination which is also used in the finale of Wonker.The ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like Olivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit , Matt Lucas as Prodnose , Hugh Grant as Oopa Loompa Guard 1, Sally Hawkins as Willy
Wonka's mum ,Rowan Atkinson as Father Julius and Jim Carter as Abscus Crunch.They are all fun to watch for a while but I found the overall experience of Wonka irritating.Unlike the superb 2018 sequel to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Returns Wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory movie of 1971 starring Gene Wilder .However I will say top marks to Timothée Chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. He is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.This chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.","

"Wonka","Coventry","9 January 2024","Before, throughout, and after watching ""Wonka"", there was just one question spooking through my head: What would Roald Dahl think of it? Dahl was a genius, and he's in my top three of favorite authors/personal heroes, but he was also known to be a very skeptical and grumpy person when it came to film adaptations of his books. ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) and ""The Witches"" (1990) were two successful and widely acclaimed film-versions of children's novels of his, but the author himself hated them. I honestly wonder what Dahl would say about a spinoff/prequel of one of the most mysterious characters he invented.We'll never know, sadly, and obviously I never knew him personally, but somehow, I like to believe that Roald Dahl would have appreciated the colorful and excessively imaginative background story that is given here to his chocolate maker Willy Wonka! Enough about the writer, though, what did I think of it? Well, I watched it at the cinema, together with my 8-year-old daughter, and we both loved it. Could have done with a little less singing, perhaps, but it's a joyous and stimulating spectacle that is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face from start to finish.If anything, ""Wonka"" is loyal to the flamboyant mindset of Roald Dahl. It's absurd without being ridiculous, it's child-friendly without being childish, it's impossible but simultaneously fascinating, and you'll be getting a couple of unusually wrapped but valuable life-lessons along the way. Willy Wonka is a naive but very optimistic young man who arrives in a Mediterranean city with the dream of opening a candy store. He learns about life the hard way, as bad luck and sabotage pursues him, but Willy never loses his optimism and finds good-hearted allies. I really don't want to write too much about the plot, as it's more than worth discovering and experiencing.I had confidence this would be a good film, and this solely based on how the duo Paul King and Simon Farnaby previously handled the adorable ""Paddington"" films. They do make use of digital and CGI effects a lot, but it's due to the story being grotesque and fantasy-like. The performances are excellent. I have great admiration for Timothy Chalamet who doesn't depict Willy Wonka quite as eccentric as Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder did in the past, but nevertheless finds the character's right balance between pleasantly deranged and unworldliness. Hugh Grant is hilarious, although allegedly he didn't enjoy it much. At the end, all the dots nicely fit into the legacy of Roald Dahl, and I think that's beautiful.","

Definitely.Do musicals recall you good old times with your acquaIntances? Absolutely.Ladies and gentlemen, that's 'Wonka'! A brilliant movie filled with magic. Chalamet delivers a wonderful performance, whose range of acting hugely widens with this role, from a 1920s clown like Chaplin to a 1950s charming dancer like Gene Kelly.I was especially delighted with the city's atmosphere, it's a Victorian London-like city. It's clear that Paul King knows how to bottle Christmas essence, mixing grayish pedestrian streets and brick buildings with goldish open malls. Watching this movie takes you back to the time when you were a child, and you walked hand in hand with your parents watching extravagant shopwindows displaying the finest products on Christmas.And what about the music? It's perfect! 'Oompah Loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a Christmas ambience. You can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys...
Finally, we're not even un mid-December ans ""it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas"" so please get yourself a hot chocolate mug get together with family and enjoy watching 'Wonka' because it will become a Christmas classic.","

"Wonka","henryhoooover","8 December 2023","This film is nothing like the older Willy Wonka films and is a huge disappointment. The story is altered a bit without giving too much away but it's not interesting enough to hold your attention. The acting is pretty average, although better in comparison to the other aspects of the film such as its humour. That's my next point, it's not funny at all. I maybe gave a little smile at 1 or 2 moments but that is all, which makes this film a failure as a comedy movie. The older Wonka films had much better humour and far better acting, therefore resulting in a much more enjoyable experience.The music is also distractingly irritating, and is certain to break windows. I regret seeing this and am dissapointed as I enjoyed the older films.Maybe young children will enjoy it but if you don't have any then I would give it a miss without a doubt.","

The casting seemed solid until you actually watch the movie and then you realize it's actually horribly off at every role. Worse, the music was so horrendously bad that it truly detracts from the movie more than it adds to it. It's one forgettable musical number after another with very little enjoyable story. It doesn't help that Timothée Chalamet doesn't have a good singing voice. The songs from Gene Wilder's version were catchy and fun to hear, learn, and eventually sing along to. This doesn't have that kind of magic or any at all really. Overall, this film is more forgettable than that Johnny Depp dumpster fire.","

Despite being broke, a young Willy Wonka aspires to open the best chocolate shop in the world. However, he finds out that the chocolate industry is run by a cabal of chocolatiers, who are drunk with power.Wonka is an excellent film. Director Paul King has given us a movie that is hilarious, endearing, has a few catchy songs & above all, is super entertaining. The set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are perfect. Watching all of Willy Wonka's magical & delicious chocolates come to life on the big screen, is an absolute joy to watch. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Willy Wonka. Chalamet gives us another unforgettable performance, this time in a light-hearted role, that shows his incredible versatility. Calah Lane is outstanding as Noodle. Olivia Colman & Tom Davis are awe-inspiring as Mrs. Scrubbit & Bleacher, respectively. Keegan Michael-Key is hysterical as the Chief of Police. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas & Mathew Baynton are perfect as Slugworth, Prodnose & Fickelgruber, respectively. Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Rakhee Thakrar, Natasha Rothwell, Rich Fulcher, Colin O'Brien & Sally Hawkins are perfect as the Oompa-Loompa, Father Julius, Abacus Crunch, Lottie Bell, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, Young Willy Wonka & Willy's Mother, respectively. Wonka is a must watch for chocolate lovers & fans of Roald Dahl's source material & its two previous big screen adaptations.

Remake of a known and beloved IP, Popular and/or established actor in lead role, holiday release, it's all there.Jaded cynicism aside, did we really need Willy Wonka's origin story? This is like Solo, it answers questions no reasonable viewer would have. The top review right now mentions it's a cash grab in the first sentence. That's correct. It's not the best version of anything based solely on that. I didn't mind the 2005 version and enjoyed the visuals but of course nothing is going to top Gene Wilder.","

"Wonka","Jsotosoto2","6 January 2024","Chalamet was the wrong casting choice for this role. Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp stepped into the larger than life role of Willy Wonka and gave the character substance and depth, a sense of something you could feel unfolding on screen. You were able to buy into their characters and believed that they actually were Willy Wonka. Unfortunately, Mr. Chalamet somehow managed to do the complete opposite. Almost every time he spoke or tried to add in a ""Wonka-esque"" quip I was immediately transported from the Wonka fantasy world to a realistic modern day one. My biggest complaint and reason why I will not recommend this movie to anyone is in large part due to the extremely lackluster songs and sense of low budget production. Low budget production? Yep, that's right. I was highly unimpressed with the feel, style, and overall vibe of the costumes, choreography, and sets. The entire thing felt rushed, thrown together, and in some inconcebible way like a high school production. I maybe laughed once during the whole movie and not even at one of the constant lame jokes. Multiple story lines that had nothing to do with Wonka himself created a sense of confusion and added to the jumbled up mess of the movie. I gave the movie 4 stars and the only reason was for the magnificent Rowan Atkinson. Also Hugh Grant was ok. Overall, this movie was such a huge disappointment it makes me want to go back and watch the originals just to make myself feel slightly better.","

"Wonka","harhouflo","2 January 2024","I really wanted to like this flick, even so, I went to the theatre with relative low expectations. Well, I should have even lowered them further. So far, enough has been said about the music. About how bad it is; and it really is bad, with just very few exceptions. I could have looked beyond that fact, being a musician myself I try to be less critical, a bit more open minded when it comes to musical numbers in movies. But in Wonka that's hard to ignore as it was just one bad song after another, sometimes crippling the already crippled super-predictible storytelling. Obviously the whole story is about Wonka but more depth often is added to other characters. You like them, you feel for them, you want them to succeed. I didn't care much for any other character, neither did my kids, they didn't care much for Noodles either. All of them seemed shallow and boring, including the villains, perhaps even Wonka himself, as I felt we were all waiting for the moment his personality would flourish and make us root for him till the end. Instead, it was more like looking forward for it to be over.In my sons's own words ""The scenery was great, the story...meh!"". In my teenage daughters' words ""this is so cringe"" (she still thinks Chalamet is very cute though). To be fair, there's very little in life teenagers don't find cringe. But this is coming form a couple of Willy Wonka movie fans, they both love and still watch the Wilder and Depp's versions. This one they said they're OK not to watch it ever again.It felt to me at times like I was watching a TV musical presentation or episode, where you kind of expect mediocre numbers and flat storytelling, because that is exactly what Wonka was. Sadly there's not a whole lot to choose from at the theatres right now and we had seen previews for Wonka that seemed promising, we all felt let down.","

"Wonka","TheVictoriousV","18 December 2023","Roald Dahl once wrote that he found Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka in 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a way too ""sappy and saccharine"" version of the character he first envisioned. Well, if that one was ""a bit too much"", Dahl is lucky to have passed away before he could witness the Timothée Chalamet version.Here is a Wonka who is full of cheer and whimsy. Being that it's a prequel, I guess we are to understand that this is set before he adopted more kooky and sinister traits, ergo this isn't quite the Wonka we know. The real issue, perhaps, is the casting. Chalamet can be dark and brooding (Dune), and a little creepy if he needs to (Bones and All), but having him dial up the whimsy feels off.Of course, I also believe that there's a missed opportunity here. A while ago, with regards to FXP's The Bear, I wrote this: ""When Timothée Chalamet was cast for the upcoming Willy Wonka prequel, many TV nerds pointed out that they could've gone with Jeremy Allen White if they wanted someone who has a sort of Chalamet energy to him, but actually LOOKS like a younger Gene Wilder, supposing that's the Wonka they were going for. ... Having watched the show that put White on the map, I see it even more. It's like they had some kind of character customization slider with Wilder on one end and Chalamet on the other and cranked it all the way up to Chalamet when they could've left it in the middle and gotten White.""Ultimately, however, I warmed up to Chalamet as the picture went along. His singing isn't always great, yet there is an earnestness to it all that seems to have won critics over. Indeed, as if this year in movies wasn't already wild enough, it now closes out with the revelation that, yeah, even the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan-fic prequel is a part of the ""cinema is back"" club. It's good -- for the most part.Perhaps we were foolish to presume that a Willy Wonka musical as done by the man behind Paddington -- boasting a cast of such names as Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman -- would be mere soulless IP nostalgia bait, especially in the year when Hollywood pictures of that ilk finally would begin to f*ck off. (So starved indeed were people for anything other than the usual slop, with its green-screened everything and persistent key-jangling, that even the return of the Saw franchise, itself more ""on fire"" than before, was cause for more jubilation than, say, most of Disney's output in 2023.) Sure enough, Wonka has more lively and well-staged musical numbers than any of Disney's recent remakes and is unabashedly colorful to look at.I maintain that some aspects looked unpromising as the trailers came out and that the final product is flawed, but this was still a joyous viewing that certainly left me in the mood for some exotic sweets.One still baffling element is the casting of Wonka's first Oompa-Loompa. Instead of a little-person actor, it's Hugh Grant's head on a small body. I understand if little people would find this sort of role demeaning (or if Peter Dinklage's comments about the exploitation of little people made studios less willing to cast little-person performers in roles like this, ironically making the landscape more difficult for the group he sought to protect as they now get even less work), but this isn't really a sight one gets used to.Lastly, allow me to once more evoke David Ehrlich with the following musing: ""There's a delicious irony to the fact that Warner Bros.' first big release since Discovery CEO David Zaslav (once again) canned a completed film in exchange for a $30 million tax write-off is an anti-capitalist fable set in a city run by a ruthless chocolate cartel who've diluted their own product in order to hoard the profits."" Hollywood will never be perfect, but sometimes, as with the year 2023, it lets out more gold than usual. Golden tickets, if you will? No? Okay.","

If you liked the Harry Potter movies, liked Les Miserables and you have a sense of humour, you will love this movie. Matt Lucas, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant and ofcourse Wonka himself are all outstanding actors.The cinema was full of people clapping, laughing, happy, and very little moving about.

"Wonka","annelauremilleville","20 December 2023","With all due respect to fans of Tim Burton's version, I think this prequel opus is a success: colors, songs, fantasy... that's exactly what you'd expect from a film on Willy Wonka, isn't it?According to my view, this « sweet fantastic reality » created by the sets, costumes and special effects is very accomplished, and helps us to immerse in Wonka's adventures to fullfill his dreams: set up his own business and share the magic of his chocolate with the rest of the world. Olivia Colman and Calah Lane are excellent all along, as is Timothée Chalamet, who once again rises to the challenges of his role. Of course, many will be unable to resist making comparisons with Johnny Depp's previous performance, but in my opinion, Mr. Chalamet has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. A perfect Christmas film for young and less young curious ones!","

The songs are not that unique, not catchy or special. I ask myself what the hell is wrong with the director. Timothee Chalamet is imho one of the greatest actors of his generation, but failed to fill the role Wonka with life. The rest of the actors stay faint. When you are a fan of Musical movies, Wonka can be your deal. But when you don't like singing in films, than I wouldn't recommend watching this one. The dialogues are also not on fleek. I expected more.I give a plus point for the costume design and the cut.For me 3/10 in the end.","

There is no heart, everything that should be magical seems wooden, the camerawork, the directing is so boring. There is no depth in the acting of Chalamet, there is no sense of danger or hardship palpable when noodle is put into the coop or when we see the people in the laundry in the basement. So there can be no relieve or urgency felt when they are rescued. It's not the fault of the actors, the cast is good. And well, I hate the musical stuff (I always do ;-)), but that's just a matter of taste and doesn't affect my rating. I guess small children could have fun with this.","

Not really something I was looking forward to. And yet the movie got to me ... it really is a feel good movie and it really works. With all the ridiculous and enhancements and caricatures it is drawing. I mean talk about evil ... it relishes in it! The actors turn it up to 11 more than once.But they know what they are doing - they do not have to be reigned in. No sir - although I assume the director had a leash on some of the things ... he had to have, right? Considering all the small details added to the movie I will go ahead and say yes.While I was a bit skeptic, the movie had me quite early. Yes you could make cases about how ""kid friendly"" this is (stunts from the start, as in do not try this at home, riding on top of a car, jumping of it), but it is quite clear that the movie is fantasy. And I think kids can tell too, without wanting to do things they see ... and arent't we all addicted to chocolate already? I'd say the answer is quite ... well revealing ... I mean obvious! Also you get to see one character change physically ... so there is that too.This may be too sweet ... if there is such a thing ... and a pun you would be able to forgive ... now on to watch the 70s movie soon ... never got around to that ... until now, this being a prequel, it should work nicely.","

"Wonka","miguelungson","4 February 2024","First, it was deceptive because it was never marketed as a musical and it is. I have no problems with musicals but it's wrong to not say so.It has an okay story, but as a fan of Roald Dahl, they never should have adapted Willy Wonka if they will completely change his character. An adaptation means a different take on the same characters and the same story. If you change Willy Wonka's backstory, then he is not Willy Wonka anymore. Without the depth of his backstory and the borderline crazy and genius, this character is definitely not Willy Wonka!!!The acting and the songs are okay, but it could actually be a different story just inspired by Willy Wonka and it would be better.","

So many dumb things happened and so many naÏve characters.It featured lots of great acting for the most part. Wonka's mom did a lot with what little screen time she had, and Olivia Colman was great as usual, but the actress who played Noodle was pretty bad.The music wasn't anything special either, apart from the songs from the original movie that they reused here. The ""World of Your Own"" song was not bad, but the rest were just forgettable.Overall I'd easily put it 3rd among the 3 Wonka movies released so far.","

There are so many nods to that version. Timothee Chalamet is a young Gene Wilder. But a softer version. He has the same magic and charm as Gene Wilder.I spent a lot of the movie with tears rolling down my face. Especially when Timothee sings ""Pure Imagination"".There are some amazing scenes. Especially when they are dancing over the rooftops of London.Hugh Grant is just so brilliant and funny as an Oompa Loompa.This film just blew me away.It is utter movie magic.It has everything.

Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of watching musicals on the screen. If I want to see a musical, I'll go to Broadway. They really need to make it clear in the trailers that this is not a movie but a musical. Did I mention I'm not a fan of musicals? If you like musicals you'll probably like this.","

"Wonka","samnaji-15383","15 December 2023","A prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an enticing idea, especially if the film is a prequel to either the 1971 or 2005 film. It should not be a difficult endeavour provided there is consistency to one film or the other. The problem I found with this film is that the setting has the Germanic vibe of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Timothee Chalamet is channeling Johnny Depp from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Apart from the Johnny Depp's Wonka impersonation, there is nothing in this film that is related to that 2005 film. The backstory of the dentist father and the origins of the oompa loompa are dropped for something different. Shame. I would have liked it if this film was set in that universe. To add to the disappointment we did not get a story that is set in the 1971 universe either as the character of Slugworth and the people are completely different as well. Put it this way it is a film very much for 2023. I mean if you are going to do a prequel, at least try and be consistent with that 1971 universe.There are some positives. I found Timothee Chalamet charming and a great fit for the role. Some of the jokes landed, but not enough to warrant a comedy (in the full house I saw it in, no one laughed out once). Paterson Joseph was fantastic as the villainous Slugworth. It was also great to see Tom Davis get more screen time (a very underrated actor). Hugh Grant was probably the best bit of the film and it is a shame we did not get more of him. The dancing was also fun to watch.Unfortunately, for me, most of the songs did not land. The story was also lame and the character of this young Wonka did not gel with the craggy, somewhat mean, reclusive character we know when his chocolate ideas get stolen. To be honest I was somewhat bored by it. I checked the time twice as I felt it was 20 minutes too long.It is not a film I would see twice after loving the first two movies. I came away disappointed as it was not the prequel I had hoped to see.","

Found myself rolling my eyes halfway through because ""here comes another sing along"".

"Wonka","Prismark10","26 January 2024","Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory from 1971 was regarded as a mixed bag for many years. A strange confection that never hit the sweet spot. Now it is regarded as a classic.Paul King and Simon Farnaby the makers of the Paddington movies have reimagined a prequel Wonka. Before Wonka started the Chocolate factory.Timothee Chalamet plays Willy Wonka. He arrives in town to open his confectionary shop and introduce the world to his magical confection.Only the illiterate Wonka finds himself press-ganged as a slave in a boarding house. He could not read the terms and conditions.The cartel of chocolatiers fix it with the authorities that Wonka fails.Wonka was a big box office hit. So unlike the 1971 film, it will not have to wait to be rediscovered.I thought this was full of interminable songs and had lazy charm. The only bright spark was Hugh Grant with the Oompa Loompa song from the original movie.A lot of the plot from the naive innocent Wonka to the vile landlord Mrs Scrubitt were recycled from other movies like Les Miserables.","

"Wonka","Amsterdam-100-87908","17 December 2023","To start off that this movie for me has a different target audience than the 2005 or even the 1971 films. The vibe is much closer to the 1971 film, which I think was the intention of the creators. That was good for me as I am not a fan of the 2005 version at all. The film is basically a fairy tale. I watched with my two boys age 8 and we all loved it. The film is visually stunning! The colours, the brightness, the kind of history feel combined with the magi was just brilliant. I see in some reviews complaints about the acting. I guess everbody's taste but for me the acting was spot on. Timothee makes an amazing Wonka. He is witty, sparkling but also just boyish and hopeful. He sings well, dances well... I loved him in this movie. I see also complaints about the story but I wonder what people actually expected? The film is again meant to suit also younger audience and it did. It is not meant to be War and Peace :) All in all for me a great movie experience. I will certainly watch it again with the kids when it comes on the streaming services.","

"Wonka","anonim-73883","28 December 2023","Opinion on the movie «Wonka» (2023):I'll start with the fact that I found out about the film «Wonka» in 2021, then I was looking at the schedule of future premieres and saw this film in future premieres and began to expect it due to the fact that my favorite actor Timothée Chalamet starred in the lead role. Later, I found out that this movie was directed by Paul King (the Paddington duology) and I began to look forward to this film even more, and finally, after two years of waiting, «Wonka» was released in theaters. Today I managed to go to the cinema and watch this film, and what can I tell you? Did my expectations come true? Let's find out!«Wonka» - is a beautiful and lamp family film about the fact that dreams come true. The most important thing is not to give up, no matter how difficult they are.The plot is naïve and simple, but on the contrary, it benefits the film, it captures you from the very beginning and does not let go until the very end, the 116-minute chronometer passed in one breath, quickly and imperceptibly.The humor in the film is funny, and a couple of moments touch you to the core. The characters were not cardboard and wooden, each of them was revealed, and you can feel for some of the characters and empathize with them.The cast is gorgeous. Timothée Chalamet is an excellent Willy Wonka, knowing that Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling and Ezra Miller auditioned for the role of Wonka, Chalamet is generally the perfect choice for this role. Chalamet played well and did not overplay. The rest of the cast also did an excellent job.I really liked the soundtrack of the film, the songs are inserted not just for show, but each of them advances the plot. One of my favorites is the song «Pure Imagination» performed by Timothée Chalamet. I liked the rest of the songs as well.Also, I would like to note the excellent costumes, scenery, visuals and excellent camerawork.As a result, «Wonka» - is an excellent and tube-like family movie that is worth watching with the whole family in the cinema. I think in a couple of decades this film will become a classic of the 21st century.My rating is 10 out of 10 and I advise you to watch it!P. S: By the way, «Wonka» was the second movie I watched about believing in a dream this month, the first one was «The Inseparables», coincidence? I don't think so.","

The songs were predictable and pedestrian. The inclusion of songs from the original showed up how ordinary they were. They could have come from a round in 'Who's Line'. I am loving Hugh Grant's return to form but I think he was let down by poor special effects that didn't allow his character to develop. Considering the film was entirely shot in the UK, some of the Milan substitute buildings were spectacular. I feel bad marking this so low but a bit more effort in the musical department was required.","

"Wonka","movie-reviews-uk","25 December 2023","I'd been hearing many excellent things about ""Wonka"" in the run up to this Christmas and figured that it would make excellent Christmas Eve entertainment. I wasn't wrong. The film is entertaining, enjoyable and easy to watch. There's very little here to offend anyone.Which is rather the point of Roald Dahl. His stories always carried a quite malevolent edge, a real tangible darkness where bad things happened. This is what made his stories so great - they never shielded you from reality despite being based in fantasy.Sadly ""Wonka"" has none of that magic. Instead Willy Wonka is simply someone who wishes to bring joy to the world and that's basically what happens despite the dastardly dealings of the baddies arrayed against him. It's all very simplistic and not particularly memorable.On the plus side the film looks great, it's very well made and the bad guys really are the most awful caricatures. There are quite a few familiar faces from the British TV and film universe and they all put in a good effort. It's just a shame that the script isn't worth the sweat.Still the younger kids will certainly enjoy ""Wonka"" with its wild array of chocolates and sweets. They should enjoy the musical numbers too as they're very slick and professional. But this isn't a Christmas classic in the making I'm afraid.","

"Wonka","nightwishouge","10 February 2024","Based on the previews, I desperately wished to avoid seeing this movie. But my girlfriend's little brother wanted to go, so hey, free popcorn. I was rewarded with a film that is suitably okay and occasionally pretty good.This is the origin story of Willy Wonka--so beholden to the 1971 version that it reuses its songs, but apparently not intended to be a canonical prequel. This Wonka is kind and magnanimous to a fault, a pure being who only wishes to inspire joy and imagination through his magical confections. It's difficult to imagine this character growing into the cynical, eccentric, and occasionally sadistic recluse Gene Wilder played. Wonka's relationship with the Oompa Loompa (Hugh Grant in a scene-stealing performance) seems carefully constructed to avoid invoking the residue of enslavement that hangs over the novel and its other adaptations. In a way, creating a backstory for a character like Wonka is as foolhardy as trying to set the Joker's origins in stone--he just works better when he's nine-tenths mystery--but the filmmakers establish so firmly early on that they're doing THEIR OWN THING that you never really feel like they're cheapening the classic interpretation of the character by over-explaining him. This is almost more of a parallel universe story, a what-if, a big-budget fan fiction that takes what it wants from the source material and doesn't sweat the rest of it.The acting is variable. I've enjoyed Chalamet in everything else I've seen him in, but his performance as Wonka is a touch too ""musical theater kid"". I suppose it's good that he's having fun, smiling and dancing with a kind of sexless energy that conveys to the audience, ""I'm not a threat!"" But it doesn't exactly make for a character with depth. Given that this is generally meant to be a fairy tale, I suppose it's all right to play a superficial archetype, but there were times when the character felt ""vacuous"" as opposed to ""relentlessly optimistic"". Olivia Colman and Tom Davis are a lot of fun as the unscrupulous owners of a sweatshop laundromat--very Roald-Dahl-esque in their playful grotesqueness. (Fan fiction prompt: What if Willy Wonka met Sweeney Todd? But keep it PG, please.) Calah Lane is unfortunately rather flat as Noodle, the obligatory sad-eyed orphan. Perhaps the writing failed her, perhaps it's that Chalamet was only giving her a single note to play against, but I found her lacking in charisma, which makes her character very slight and difficult to really invest in, which in turn hampered the sweetness of the ending. Everybody else is suitable to their roles.The biggest problem with Wonka is that it never really soars as a musical. The numbers are perhaps entertaining in the moment, but the staging often feels unimaginative and the music is forgettable. The only tunes you'll be humming on the way out of the theater are the standards from the '71 version. It almost feels as though the filmmakers made a straight narrative film and some studio head saw the result and was like, ""No songs? But the audience will expect songs in a Wonka movie! Quick, go shoot a few."" The third act pretty much eschews musical numbers altogether until the (underwhelming) reprise of ""Imagination"". Everything feels weightless and inconsequential the moment the characters start belting out a ditty, and the excess of CGI doesn't help. The movie works a lot better as a gentle comedy--pleasantly formulaic, at times emotional, and occasionally even whimsical.Wonka is no Paddington, but there's enough to put in the Plus column that I look forward to director Paul King's next endeavor.","

Pretty poor origin story he was the sub character, which was a huge mistake.But saying that it still had me laughing in parts. The casting was spot on which is rare nowadays.

"Wonka","lisafordeay","10 December 2023","Wonka is a 2023 musical fantasy starring Timothy Chalamet,Hugh Grant,Jim Carter,Olivia Coleman,Keegan Michael Key and Matt Lucas. Directed by Paul King(Paddington),the story tells the tale of Willy Wonka(Chalamet) who dreams of opening up his own chocolate store. But he ends up being stuck in a bnb owned by an evil couple (Coleman)who uses their guests as slaves. So Willy decides to make his dream a reality by asking the slaves to help him create a chocolate store in spit of the evil chocolaters and of course the evil couple. Will he succeed in his dreams?.Overall I enjoyed this film. The songs are good but not as memorable as say The Greatest Showman(they are more like Mary Poppins Returns)and the story has been done before so many times. Hugh Grant had me in stitches throughout as the Oompa Loompa.If you enjoyed Mary Poppins Returns or The Greatest Showman then you'll love this film. Also features Rowan Atkinson as a priest.","

And despite it sometimes deviating from the books, I love the 1971 movie with Peter Ostrum and Gene Wilder as Charlie and Willy Wonka. I wasn't a fan of the 2005 Willy Wonka movie (and I will not call it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) because even though it set itself up as a truer to the text readaptation of the book, it completely sacrificed to that for an origin story and character assassination of Willy Wonka which completely undermined the books and everything about them.Having said that, I went to the theatres with heavily managed expectations for this one and I z was surprised by the extent to which I loved it. Unlike the 2005 Willy Wonka movie, this didn't try to have its cake and eat it too. It was just his origin story and didn't attempt to splice that in with a new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory adaptation. And it does so brilliantly.Chalamet played Willy Wonka so well that I frequently forgot he was the same actor as Paul in the Dune remake. Wonka's found family relationship with Noodle was sweet and heartwarming. I greatly enjoyed the original songs and new dance sequences as well as the covers of pure imagination.Slugworth and the others were extremely memorable villains (and I would defend the race swap on the grounds that 1971 Slugworth was an imposter.) And indeed, quite a lot of the humour, in addition to being quite funny was the kind of humour you would see in a Roald Dahl book.There are three criticisms of this movie I feel compelled to refute. 1) But Willy Wonka isn't that heroic. (My answer:In the sequel he is) 2) Willy Wonka is way too trusting in this. (My answer: Yes and that's an actual plot point in this movie and it's worth noting that in the Chocolate Factory story, Willy Wonka's secrets were stolen from his factory by corporate spies already meaning that if the movie ends with him opening the factory then he shouldn't be that cynical yet.) 3) But this movie doesn't work with the Chocolate Factory lore. (My answer to that; It does if you read it as a prequel to the 1971 movie specifically and this film gives more than enough reason to believe that that's meant to be the case.)So in conclusion, I loved it.","

"Wonka","silverpinkcity","15 March 2024","Just....no. This movie was disappointingly tedious and boring. I almost fell asleep a few times. I sort of couldn't wait for it to end! I never felt this way watching the other two Willy Wonkas. And wow, I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie.You hardly ever hear anyone talk about the Johnny Depp Willy Wonka version, and I have to admit. I liked it! It was so weird and quirky and strange and downright funny...including some very interesting back story that the first Willy Wonka movie didn't have. Don't get me wrong. Like everyone else, I adore the first movie; the Gene Wilder version. However, UNlike everyone else...I also adore the Johnny Depp version, just as much! So I'm not opposed to new things being made and using different people, etc... However, this new Wonka movie? It just didn't captivate.This new Wonka movie wasn't fun, like the others. It wasn't unique and funny and entertaining. It was just sort of generic and soul-less. With the other versions, Willy Wonka is sort of an off-putting character...not very socially adept. But I think that's what makes him so interesting! There's this sort of ""dark side"" to him, which makes him say unexpected things. He's not predictable.Now in this new movie, the Willy Wonka character is syruppy nice. Friendly and happy and incredibly social with everyone, and it's like...wait a minute. This isn't the Willy Wonka we all know! How did he go from this amiable lovable guy to this weird anti-social hermit chocolate creator?Now if that had been the story arc of this prequel movie, maybe I could have accepted that. Like...what happens that makes this Wonka character the strange, almost sinister person he becomes in the movies we all know and love? But no...do not expect any interesting story arc like that, or you will be as disappointed as I was.This new movie isn't about Willy Wonka being clever and creative and coming up with all sorts of machines to make his crazy candy. No...in this movie that all comes so easily due to some unexplainable magical powers Willy Wonka evidently possesses. Like, he can just wave his hand and make flying candy appear! He puts no work or effort into it, at all.Then there's all the cringey songs, like this some sort of scrubbed clean Ice-capades show. And what was with that weird ""new"" past they show us, of when Willy Wonka was a little kid? Where is Willy Wonka's abusive dentist father? Why did they just take that out?And yea...that whole story with the orphan girl? Horrible! This isn't supposed to be a movie about some orphan girl. It's like the writers weren't even sure what movie they were writing! Make a different movie about a poor orphan girl if you're so hot to do that. Oh wait. We already have one. Annie. And this girl in this movie? Zero personality! Yawn!This movie was supposed to be about Willy Wonka and what led up to him running his candy factory and living like a hermit! Or at least I thought.Okay, so you can I wasn't happy with the movie. And ONE Oompa-Loompa? We all KNOW there was MORE than one! Even if that Oompa-Loompa is Hugh Grant, and by the way, I just thought that was weird. I mean, I wasn't seeing an Oompa-Loompa, I was seeing a tiny orange Hugh Grant, for pete's sake!So.... I say skip it. It's really just that bad. There's no charm or cleverness or Willy Wonka-ness about it! It doesn't feel like Willy Wonka, at all. And I'm sorry to say that, I really am. After all, I was really looking forward to this movie!","

"Wonka","PennyReviews","11 December 2023","'' Wonka '' is a musical taking inspiration of the 1971 version of the book adaption of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, serving as a prequel to the well known story. And trully, King does what King did in Pandington: give a heartwarming, enjoyable fairtale that pleases both adult and younger audiences.First of all, the songs were enjoyable, well performed, with entertaining dancing sequences, and witty lyrics. The costumes and CGI were all great as well, creating the right atmosphere for the story to be properly unfold.As for the story itself, it is pleasant, though, some scenes were a bit too much and a bit cheesy, and the progress of the plot was predictable as well. But the overall result was entertaining and heartwarming.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.","

"Wonka","filmtohster","9 December 2023","WONKA is a huge surprise and a fun time at the movies. I didn't really expect much going in, besides King's attachment as director, but was surprised at how well-made this film is. It blends movie magic, well choreographed musical numbers, and a heartwarming story to make the perfect family film. Although I would've preferred a bit more moral and meaning to the story, Wonka delivers a feel-good experience and I enjoyed it a lot. It is just what it needs to be and subverts expectations. When I first heard about Chalamet's casting as the title character, I thought it wouldn't work, coming off of Dune (2021), but I was wrong. His charisma and joyous presence on screen made me realize his capability as an actor. All of the cast members were really good, but the main star of the film is director Paul King. He previously directed Paddington 1 and 2, two films my family and I really enjoyed, and was my only source of optimism for this film. He really knocked it out of the park with the way he handled the story and reassured my faith in him as a filmmaker. The way he handled the musical elements of the film were especially well done. Overall, this is one of the better films I've seen this year and deserves more attention.","

"Wonka","bob-276-155252","22 December 2023","This is an especially delightful movie at a time when I think we all need the joy that most movies are missing. The message is simply to follow your dream and have a good time while you're doing it. And, of course, watch out for the bad guys who want to stop you. This movie felt like a comfortable, funny, enjoyable Disney movie from my childhood. A modern Mary Poppins or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. This prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory had memorable music, fun dancing, great special effects, lovable characters and mean villains, and everything you could want in a clever story. Fun for the whole family. You will leave the theater feeling much better than when you entered. Let's hope this is the beginning of a trend.","

Annoying disney musical. Childish humour to try make it funny or entertaining..Best suited for children. Lost its roots or could have been so much more.For those who never watched the previous movies it may come as an enjoyment but, you stuck with the wrong memories that will not stick and be remembered. Like a famous brand and someone came and made a reject range of it. Lika an original favorite desert passed through generations and someone mixed in other ingredients and calls it the same thing that will never live up to the expectations of what it used to be.","

Now they have this one and the unfortunate, one where they made Johnny Depp look like a petfile. Just quit the original was perfect. That or at least make a new one where Charlie in running the damn place.Still really is sad that you have to keep remaking movies that turned out amazing. Why not do a remake of the crow. That way you can just destroy his legacy of it being a amazing movie.That or remake the wizard of oz. Since the actress is dead, you can just ruin another good movie.","

"Wonka","rjsullivanjr","8 January 2024","It's wonderful to look at. The cast is accomplished and engaged; however, the music is mediocre and the lyrics don't have the edginess and zest that one associates with Dahl and his Wonka worlds (Charlie and C. F/Great Glass Elevator, etc.).Funniest line, by a mile, is Rowan Atkinson answering the phone: ""Pulpit!""In a two hour picture though, that makes for a massive shortage of memorable lines.The indentured servants in the washing factory lack sufficient backstory for us to care about their fates. Not to mention Wonka's own hazy background -- how does he wield magic so effortlessly? A better history of the chocolate ""cartel"" might have made those enemies more daunting instead of bumbling foils. The story is a mess. I feel for Mr. Chalamet who throws himself into a part that doesn't really find the beating heart of the Wonka mystique.","

It's also a musical. Timothee arrives in a little town that is known for it's chocolate makers, to set up his own little chocolate shop. In fact, it is run by a cartel of chocolatiers but they don't want any competition, so they do everything that they can to hinder Timothee setting up his business. Olivia plays a shady boarding house lady that puts Timothee-and others-into a situation where the residents have to work off their rent in her basement. Keegan is a policeman and Rowan is a priest that the chocolatiers bribe to do their bidding-with chocolate, of course-and Hugh plays an Oompa Loompa that is after Timothee for his own reasons. If you liked the 1971 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory or the 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you should like this one, too. I liked it better.It's rated PG for mild violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I liked it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"Wonka","Shamus248","29 December 2023","In an age where the over-saturation of superhero flicks is leading to giant Marvel productions becoming box office bombs, and the public is yearning for quality pictures to hit the big screen, gliding in comes Wonka. The third feature length film based on Roald Dahl's 1964 book, this serves as an origin story for Willy Wonka, portrayed by Timothée Chalamet.This prequel adventure captures all of the charm and purity of the Gene Wilder-led 1971 classic. Though it discards almost all of the edge and darkness that occupied both that film and the 2005 follow-up, that's honestly one of this film's strengths. This film is brimming with boundless amounts of heart, soul, warmth and humanity. Chalamet is nothing short of stellar as Wonka. He oozes empathy for those around him and dedication to his chocolatiering craft.The music and choreography are masterful. Every number has so much heart. The editing and special effects bring the in-universe setting to life in a way that is as majestic and dreamlike as the source material suggests. Calah Lane also shines as the adorable Noodle and Hugh Grant as the iconic Oompa Loompa.Just when I thought they didn't make movies like this anymore, this one left me with such a big smile on my face. This is an adventure and experience the whole family will want to enjoy again and again!","

"Wonka","TheMovieBBQ","21 January 2024","This is a trivial watered down dart board scripting. Essentially take a great work and arranging it in theost diluted way inorder to pretend to be unique. Extremely predictable dialogue and interjected with the most vanilla.lazy AI generated CGI and computer voice enhcnaed Ssng-along.kareoke at best.Was expecting a fantastic musical with an original take, but this is clearly some delusional direction with incoherent fantasy CGI travesty.The delivery of this particular story completely assassinate, ignore ls and disassembles the works of Roald Dahl.l to make a bick off the name.The only saving grace is the most excellent Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson and of Keegan-Michael Key the rest dial the roles in like some year 1 acting class due to the poor story and lack of leadership in the script for strong colourful characters. The portrayal of the main characters are diminished by the deeply superficial stereotypes rooted in culture rather than actual story.If you think this is harsh, try hearing the 11 and 12 year olds only laugh when Grant, Atkinson and MK deliver lines with flawless timing and vocal tincture due to some serious experience with rubbish scripts. The rest of cast did the best they could while delivering lines to green coated objects or green onesies - which leads to the next point...Visual effects, often are poorly executed and lazy with perspectives that bends fantasy into complete nonsensical visual oddity. Sometimes set building is worth it, just to deliver a believable charm to classic fantasy. The CGI is often visually askew and breaks immersion often. May as well has the set staff hanging about in any given scene and no one would bat an eyelidThe misical score is well executed and the throwback re arrangements are excellent but feels like the musics direction got told hard what to make. It was missings the individual input that is required to give it a X factor that takes a movie lift from the trivial into a classic.Full credit to cast and musicians whom must of been frustrated on set at the atrocious job of the editong so 4th wall breaking may as well if has the crew in shot.Writing - Sorry Bucket family, you.Do not exist - we will just do some random stuff and create more random stuff completely unrelated - I guess the sequel will be called Elevator and be about a magical egg beater.

"Wonka","meydiana-65242","29 January 2024","Wonka is the spiritual prequel to the 1971 masterpiece and family-classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This film is hyper focused on the backstory behind the wacky, eager and joyous chocolatier as he returns from a seven-year excursion and attempts to make his way in the world as the most renowned chocolate maker. Throughout the film, Wonka is faced with the success and failure of a candy-maker, while meeting a group of captive workers in a launderette, most notably a young girl named Noodle, who follow him on his journey to attaining his dream and facing the Chocolate Cartel trio consisting of Slugworth, two other well-known chocolate makers, as well as the police force. It is, in essence, the companion to the 1971 film and illuminates the humble beginnings of the titular character in a way we never thought we would see. Timothée Chalamet's performance as Willy Wonka is brilliant. Timothée, throughout the film, is able to capture that aurora we all felt watching Gene Wilder play the quirky and fun candy maker. His mannerisms, temperament, humor, wittiness, and enthusiasm is unmatched, cementing himself as the Willy Wonka we know and love in Gene Wilder. As first, many seemed skeptical of how well he would perform, but undoubtedly, Timothée Chalament is simply wonderful. Another charming performance is that of Calah Lane as Noodle, the orphan worker Wonka meets in the film. Her companionship matched with Chalamet's well-natured character, displays such emotion and hope. Lane's character is confused and silenced initially, but through Wonka, she finds herself and then builds the confidence to become wholesome while tagging along with him. The last performance that was quite impressive and exciting was Hugh Grant as Lofty, a cunning, ill-humored, and persistently annoying Oompa Loompa bent on making Wonka pay for his crime of stealing from Loompaland. Hugh Grant is hysterical, even though his appearance in the film is short of just half an hour in segmentation. Though his screen time was limited, Hugh Grant's performance as an Oompa Loompa is both comical and entertaining. He really does capture the disposition of the Oompa Loompa's from the 1971 film and even sings in the original riddle-like voice and rhythm from the 1971 film too! The additional and supporting cast are exceptional as well. Keegan-Michael Key, Rowan Atkinson, and company just add that much more laughs and interest to the film. The music accompanying the film is beautiful. Just like the original film, the score and compositions add such wonder to this story and even contain subtle clues of songs you may have heard in the Mel Stuart film! Such light-heartedness and beauty give the music such importance and depth, truly encapsulating the movement and tone of the film. The CGI, practical effects, scenery, and more were outstanding as well. Everything was on the dot and seemed real to the point that it will leave you feeling that making chocolate that can make you fly or coming across little orange men with green hair can actually exist! Overall, Wonka is the perfect film, not only because of its simplicity, but how it is representative of establishing the backstory of both literature and cinema's most iconic character. Though Gene Wilder is sadly no longer with us, he would be proud of Timothée's performance and the charm presented by every bit of time and effort put into the making of this film. A must see film is you love Willy Wonka or if you generally love this type of film!","

Just came home with my now 50 year old daughter from watching it in our local movie theater, that was recently renovated, and was around then. We both loved this version. I can't imagine how some people could give it rather low ratings. It was perfect. The young man playing a young Willy was great, liked the other actors also. Huge improvement from the Johnny Deep version. Perfect movie for young kids, nothing in the movie that was offensive. Plan to buy it, although I'm now almost 77.

"Wonka","Wildlost","6 December 2023","Spectacular production, wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there was a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family.Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka, I did not have much to go on. I did not even know it was a musical until the movie started, and then, I was engaged from beginning to end.From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead.If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it!

"Wonka","Chris-74934","30 December 2023","Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way. First off, I am not a big fan of musical movie adaptations, however, I respect that many people do. I also appreciate that this art form requires a lot of talent, and I tend to take this into account when reviewing movies (in other words, I put my bias aside and evaluate how much effort was put into the movie, whether I really liked it or not). Having said that, this film was a dud. Every new song from this movie lacked cohesion and did not rhyme (unless real words were butchered to make it fit). It almost seemed as if somebody put together the complete soundtrack during the length of a 5-minute shower. Perhaps, ""Dr. Suess' Talent-less Twin"" put together this atrocity. That could be the only explanation. You will really appreciate the original films ability to seamlessly mix the word ""trepidation"" into a song, after sitting through this two-hour nightmare.Now, let's move on to the worst aspects of this movie: the plot and acting. The main actor playing Wonka (Timothy Chalet) lacks the basic screen presence needed for a supporting actor, much less a lead in a major motion picture. His embarrassingly small range of emotion was, at best, laughable. Other supporting actors were overbaked, resembling mere caricatures on many occasions. The plot was simply idiotic and bland, and could not be saved by the presence of Hugh Grant. I really cannot see why this movie received such high praise. I had very low expectations and would have given this a much higher review, had it just been average. I rarely give reviews below a 3 or 4 out of 10, but this movie is a worthy exception. Do not waste your money if you are on the fence. In fact, see ""The Holdovers"" instead, this holiday season.","

The pacing was solid and 2 hours never felt laborious or drawn out.Where this movie shines was the acting/casting. Tomothèe Chalamet was absolutely perfect in this role as was the rest of the cast. The characters were colorful, endearing, and wildly entertaining. The music was fun, touching, and a few songs had me laughing out loud.I went into this movie to spend time with family.

So to compare the new Wonka movie to the original would be a little unfair.I did have such high expectations for the new Wonka, and was desperate to watch the movie. The movie trailers had me hooked, the outstanding list of actors just added to the anticipation, as well as the buzz and reviews of the movie.In its own right the new Wonka movie is very good, the sets, the acting, the star studded cast, tick every box on how to create a blockbuster. But to me it didn't quite hit the mark, and I somehow felt it could have been better.But don't get me wrong, it is highly enjoyable to watch, and takes you on a very special journey where age doesn't matter, and the movie will be enjoyed by young and old.You have to watch to make up your own mind, but I feel many of the ten star reviews are maybe a little biased.?","

"Wonka","Sunsphxsuns","6 January 2024","About halfway into Wonka (2023) I began wondering if ""reimagining"" classic films is always a good idea. Do we really need another Casablanca (1942) or Gone With the Wind (1939)? Does Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (painted between 1503-1509) truly need ""CGI"" and other digital effects to enhance her iconic smile? I don't think so. Yet, there seems to be a lack of wonderfully original scripts in Hollywood. If that's not true, then why else would film companies continue to tamper with that which has already been wonderfully done? Perhaps it is because Wonka is a pre-sold property. It already has several generations of fans to bolster the box office receipts. After all, film making may be a fascinating art form, but at the end of the day, it is still a business with a bottom line.To its credit, Wonka offers a clever back story of Willie's origins. The film also introduces us to several new songs, some of which, are quite memorable, but not nearly as much as the reboot of the wistful tune, ""Pure Imagination."" One thinks of the late Gene Wilder even as Timothée Chalamet performs a very capable version on the screen. Chalamet is very charming, of course (he's a tremendous actor), yet the character is not written nearly as cynically as Wilder's 1971 portrayal. Indeed, even the brooding darkness in Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) is absent here. Wonka is far more optimistic than its two predecessors, though perhaps that is not a bad thing, especially for younger audiences.For the most part, ""Wonka"" is visually entertaining and hits several high marks one would expect for a film that had a $125,000,000 budget. It's an elegant enterprise to be sure, but nevertheless has some very BIG shoes to fill.No spoilers here as usual, but I can share that Timothée Chalamet reportedly was constantly sick during production as a result of having to eat an extraordinary amount of chocolate and candy.","

"Wonka","bastille-852-731547","17 December 2023","While I cannot say we definitively needed a prequel establishing the foundation of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, I still was looking forward to this film because of Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and having grown up with and enjoyed Roald Dahl's books. While far from perfect, ""Wonka"" should satisfy families looking for a good time at the movies this holiday season. The film may contain fewer direct tie-ins to Dahl's book than some viewers might expect; however, the whimsy and exaggerated humor of Dahl's writing is very present this story in enthralling and clever ways. The film centers around the conflicts that ensue when Willy Wonka wants to open his own chocolate shop, but realizes that the chocolate industry is heavily monopolized by a ""chocolate cartel"" of corrupt influencers.The film's aesthetics are unique compared to the 1971 Gene Wilder film and the 2005 Johnny Depp film (which also makes sense given the prequel nature,) but they are still very engaging. In particular, the production design of a wintry European city is frequently gorgeous, with excellent cinematography integrated with practical visual effects. Timothee Chalamet is great as Willy Wonka, although his singing during the musical numbers isn't anything exceptional. Yet his charisma fully inhabits the role to make an earnest and endearing character. The supporting characters are mostly underused except for the orphan girl Noodle. Hugh Grant has limited screentime as an Oompah-Loompa, but he does steal the show in every scene he's in. The overarching story of ""Wonka"" is a bit on the formulaic and sentimental side, but Chalamet's acting, enjoyable musical numbers and scrumptious production values make this a sweet and deftly paced treat for both kids and adults. Recommended. 7/10Note: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium format screen. The picture and sound quality were very good, particularly during the musical numbers.","

"Wonka","surrinderella","10 December 2023","The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.","

It might have just made its way onto my yearly Christmas watchlist.","

"Wonka","njijaaj","20 December 2023","There's a warm glow to this film. A comfort of joy washes over you as you settle down for this visual treat. It is a borderline musical and it does not take long to establish that musical numbers will come your way.. a lot. They are catchy for sure, but they are unlikely to win any awards. I really did like Timothée Chalamet in this. I thought it was a great casting choice. I'm sure there was a lot of thought went into choosing him and it paid off. I actually preferred his of all the WONKAs gone before. Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp were bordering psychotic weirdos, although I'm probably alone in that thought. Chalamet takes an easier friendlier approach and makes for his friendships in the film much more believable. I don't think the film would have worked otherwise. You know it's a HEYDAY movie now when there is an olde worlde funfair chucked in (and a giraffe) and the cast from past heyday movies (especially from Paddington) make a return for this predominantly British cast. Tom Davis was the chef T-Bone and plays Bleacher in this. I actually laughed out very loudly in the cinema when he puts his lederhosen on! Overall I loved this movie. My hard to please son who is 10, gave it an 8.9 so I'd trust that more than what I'm writing. Overall, lots of fun with a good ending.","

Paul King perfection that is a delight to watch, and which lifted our spirits and provided momentary escape from the real world. I loved the entire film but Tom Davis performance was a highlight. I cannot I see him in a mini kimono with a tiny tea cup and saucer. Comic genius no doubt facilitated by partnering with Olivia Colman in the film. It's not as wonderful as Paddington or Paddington 2 but that's ok, a tough act to follow. However, I would happily watch any Paul King film multiple times - there's no side to the humour - pure joy.","

Timothee Chalamet really gets in the role of Willy Wonka without trying to copy Gene Wilder, clearly playing the part in his own way, also the rest of the cast are pretty good also. This movie really stands on it's own, guaranteeing to the audience that have seen the original.","

I know others around me were feeling it too because we laughed together and struggled to hold back tears towards the end. Worth the hype. Worth my time. Worth my money.

"Wonka","baileycrawly","14 January 2024","Wonka is an interesting film. As far as origin stories go, they don't exactly set it up for something you would ever think would be successful. And then, with the likes of the handsome (and talented) Timothee Chalamet in the cast, it's easy to think of this movie as something hastily made simply because the ""Willy Wonka"" property is still viewed as profitable by the studio.And, while that may be true to an extent, this movie was overall pretty decently made. Timothee not only delivers his trademark second-to-none acting chops in front of the camera, but he also adds singing to his repertoire (something I, personally, have never seen him do in a role). He's got a gorgeous singing voice, which serves to make this even better.There are lots of little homages to Gene Wilder and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film as well and, although they often feel like yet another soulless act of fan service (isn't that everywhere these days?), it still holds up pretty well on its own.The music is fun and catchy, the characters are easily sympathizable and relatable, and the story flows well enough to keep me fully interested throughout the duration of the film. Where it starts to fall apart, however, is in the lore... particulalry surrounding the Oompa Loompas and how they came to work for Wonka.Look, I can fogive Hugh Grant in part for doing a relatively terrible job in the role (he was focused primarily on the payday of it all and, at this point, who can really blame him?), but what's a little bit harder to forgive is that, given that this film is billed as the origin of Willy Wonka, the inconsistencies of where, exactly, the Oompa Loompa characters came from and how Wonka ended up being tied to them is completely inaccurate and muddled to the story present in the book as well as both film versions (although more extensively in Tim Burton's rendition of the tale).Overall, if you can suspend your disbelief and forget (to a certain degree) about the finer details of the original story, this is a fun little piece of moviemaking magic that isn't afraid to have a good time. And you should, too, if you relax and enjoy it.I want to close by giving quick props to the satirical elements tackling the government, coroprations and their shady behaviours. Sure, it was played up for laughs but I can't help but feel the industry is taking a few (light-hearted?) jabs at themselves with the story behind this film.","

"Wonka","shelbythuylinh","15 December 2023","I agree with one reviewer over Timothee Chalamet portrayal of Willy Wonka. And that the late great Gene Wilder the original is the original.But this is a new version over in the late Ronald Dahl's book series. Timothee's Wonka is innocent but optimistic and how that he is poor but still doesn't stop him.He plans to spend a night over in a lodge like, only to be tricked into paying more and when he can't come up with it, forced to do laundry with others like him who can't pay against their will as the owners were bribing people.But when his new friends including an accountant and comedian to name a few. And an imprisoned orphan named Noodle who wants to find her real parents, want to figure out a way to make their way home and be release from their predicament.Wonka only can make chocolate but the antagonist in the movie a corrupt chocolate maker names Sluggsworth and his two minions want to put their plans in action who gets a corrupted police chief played by the hilarious Keegan Michael Kay to stop Wonka.The chief seems to be decent but is conflict. It is with a great ensemble cast with Rowan Atkinson as a corrupt priest.","

Even the music, on the way home from the theater noting really stuck with me, other than the throw back pieces from the original movie.There were elements of the original as well as the remake, but just not the memorable type from either.

"Wonka","cdjh-81125","8 December 2023","I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining. All the villainous characters were over-the-top in all the right ways but they did start to wear out their welcome for me after a while. Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa is such a great concept and he is fantastic but he wasn't in the movie as much as I would've liked because he and Chalamet made such a great pair. I also think the film was starting to feel a little long by the time the 3rd act came around but I was having such a good time watching it that it didn't bother me too much.Wonka was far better than it had any right to be and I could absolutely see myself rewatching many more times. Chalamet is basically perfect and this role just goes to show how much range he has as an actor. I would fight back against anyone who thinks this is a corporate cash grab because the feeling it gave me is one very few other movies have given me all year. I think the best compliment I could give Wonka is that it's absolutely a movie I would show my kids one day.","

Chalamet is as charming and sincere as Wonka. Wonka's supporting cast are brilliant, and I can't keep the tunes out of my head. Wilder's Wonka was too dark, and Depp's Wonka was wacky just for the sake of being wacky. Chalamet's Wonka is just right, the right mix of warmth, sincerity, and wackiness. The musical sequences aren't too long, drawn out, or tedious. Chalamet shows versatility by handling the singing and dancing sequences like a true song and danceman. This movie showcases oodles of fun, over-the-top characters. Keegan-Michael Key is delightful as the corrupt police chief and chocoholic. Wonka is a fun ride from start to finish.","

For those that love musicals I'm sure it's fine but I personally don't like musicals at all. The Johnny Depp version was decent where the songs were funny and not over the top. Way more dialogue in that one and that just makes sense for someone that wants to watch something that gets right to the point.","

"Wonka","cricket30","20 December 2023","As Queen Victoria often said regarding Sherlock Holmes, ""The hat makes the man."" I think that Willy's topper from his latest cinematic outing is his best head covering of all three films. The milliner for this movie did a great job in matching head-wear to character to actor. This picture deserves at least a nomination in the ""Best Costume"" category on the basis of Willy's derby alone. Though some viewers may quibble that when the Chocolate Cartel blows up the ship onto which they've lured their rival toward the close of this story his hat should have disappeared as he swam miles to shore, this criticism overlooks the fact that Willy is a magician, so his hat obviously is magical, too. The film crew even included a Magic Consultant. In summary, this prequel gets a big boost from its attention to detail, particularly when it comes to hats.","

The girl who played Noodle has no acting skill whatsoever. None of the songs sticked. There are a few chuckle-worthy moments with Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman, but that's more because of performer charisma. Sally Hawkins is also laudable just for her perfect mom image. I do appreciate Timothee Chalamet for attempting to imitate Johnny Depp's version of Wonka in terms of the mannerism, expression, and cadence. Overall, a pretty bland film.","

He was great as Wonka!Hugh Grant was great as an Oompa Loompa, it was very funny seeing him as a small orange man with green hair.I loved the new characters like Noodle, Mrs. Scrubitt, Bleacher, the 3 chocolate cartels and there were so many more and they were all great!This version of Wonka has nothing to do with the previous movies ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" it is completely different, it is about how Willy Wonka became the famous chocolatier we know now.There were many musical numbers including new versions of ""Pure Imagination"" and ""Oompa Loompa"" it was very nostalgic and nice to hear again. The Original Score is amazing, and I haven't stoped listening to it since it came out, it's just something else, it's magic! To be honest I cried when Timothée started singing ""Pure Imagination"".There is a scene where Wonka and Noodle are running away from the zoo and singing as well as dancing and that specific scene melted my heart, it was so sweet and nice.Timothee brought a new version of Wonka to the world, there are references to the Gene Wilder Wonka and when you notice them there is a little spark in you which makes you smile! The movie is filled with love, happiness and hope as well as adventure.I really recommend going and watching this movie in the theatre with your family, friends and loved ones in general, it brings a bit of hope to you and it was just so magical.The cast was amazing and they all did an amazing job!""Everything in the world started with a dream"" 🍫🎩","

It's got a good story, good characters & plenty of visuals & dazzling ace effects. Even for a musical, it's ace & really well made! The films a little long at 1 hour & 50 minutes & does drag a tad bit, but it's good with some not bad songs that are well shot when the actors dance & break into song!Overall, it's a pretty good film!

"Wonka","KFstudios2009","12 December 2023","Wonka's story in this film is very weakly based on the book, but they made something new, something we can call a prequel, but not exactly. It's a story on its own. The story that tells us the beginnings of Willy Wonka, and how he and his chocolate became famous. First of all, I was a little skeptical about this. I thought that the new actor for Willy would be dumb and badly played, but I got the exact opposite of it. Wonka performed by Timothée Chalamet played absolutely amazing, he did have this magic that somehow Johnny Depp didn't have. He was the actor that fitted the character surprisingly best, from what I have seen so far. Timothée did sing very good, too, and he sang the songs greatly with a nice voice, as well as the rest of the cast. The story was gripping and extremely well developed. Wonka's flashbacks with his mother (Not father this time) was a well addition to the story and his character development came brighter in, and he was more understandable then, too. Wonka as a character was good introduced, but I think his backstory came much later, and could come more on the beginning, but that's ok. Wonka's friend, Noodle, was a good addition to the story, and she as his friend was something amazing. Wonka's connection with Noodle was organic and didn't felt fake at all. The action and build-up was in a way that I could see it was a Paul King film. He directed the two Paddington movies, and he has a similar style of humor and way of building up action. The moral was good, good value and something everyone can get out from the story. But the scenography was the absolutely best thing about the film. The strong, powerful colors from the candy and chocolate, and the amazing decorations and exteriors in the town they lived in. Nice visuals, as well as the costumes for the actors and actress. Hugh Grant as the Umpa-Lumpa had a fantastic costume, and he was characterized great with good make-up and had the perfect size for the creature. The songs were composed fine, sometimes could the text have a better rhythm to the melody, but that was rare, maybe two or three times it happened. In the end, Wonka was a great experience, a perfect film for the whole family, I really liked the first film, but this one is just more magical and made in a different way, that I really enjoyed. Recommending!","

"Wonka","akoaytao1234","9 February 2024","This is awful. Its a kind of slop you put out and forgot afterwards BUT I felt this is more offensively bland than usual.Timothy does ok work in this. Definitely the initial previews did not do him justice BUT this by no means a triumph at all. He plays the Wonka here earnestly. The kind of performance in Musical tend to put to their in-offensive and charming 2nd lead. The other performers were fine too. Its a bit too adjust too to be honest. No one from the other leads were really that noteworthy maybe than Olivia Coleman who did a fine performance.I have big issue with the direction of this one. I think it does not do justice for its performance aspect by cutting off the performers from their torso or cutting immaculately in the worst angles. It just so small to look at. Especially the biggest charm of musical is how it use space and movement (ie claustrophobia or emptiness tied with the rigidness in Cabaret or the expanse and movement of the 50s musicals). It such a choice for this one. Also, the singing here is so awful.Not my film.","

"Wonka","steveinadelaide","18 December 2023","I love chocolate! And it would seem that the consumption of nearly 7.5 million metric tonnes of it around the world last year indicates there's a lot of people out there who do too! And who among us hasn't enjoyed the past movies about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory? But how did Willy Wonka get to be such a famous character? Director Paul King has the answer in the new Wonka movie.The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are all better than they needed to be to make this movie sure to be a hit. Timothé Chalamet, who portrays Willy Wonka, gives the character a youthful charm and eccentric edge that feels new and nuanced.The world of Wonka is whimsical and filled with vibrant colours, and the candy creations are delightfully yummy! The original songs are catchy and heartwarming. The well-composed songs are seamlessly integrated into the story and add a beautiful touch of magic and emotional depth. Despite my usual distaste for musicals, I found myself tapping my foot along on multiple occasions. Wonka celebrates the power of our imaginations and encourages us to embrace our own unique dreams.Considering how entertaining Wonka was for the most part, I feel bad about having to criticise it. I'll have to indulge in the guilty pleasure of chocolate consumption to compensate 😉. Just three things I'll mention:Firstly, the story feels a bit rushed sometimes, particularly in the second half of the movie, which leaves some of the character arcs underdeveloped. Second, if you are familiar with Roald Dahl's world or have watched the original film, you might recognise some of the story's fundamental plot points. And, finally, while Wonka shines, some of the supporting characters, like the young Oompa-Loompas, could have had their personalities fleshed out.Leaving those few flaws behind, it is important to mention that Wonka tackles some serious issues! It reminds us that 'the greedy beat the needy every time.' It touches on the themes of resilience and resourcefulness-traits we definitely need to develop nowadays. And most importantly, does candy have a point?Wonka is beautiful and moving, and it shows how important it is to be creative and follow one's dreams. And it justifies the necessity of chocolate! Despite its flaws (a predictable plot and underdeveloped supporting characters), Wonka is a fun film with a fantastic performance from Timothée Charlamet and is sure to be a hit with families with children older than eight. Lots of grownups, though, will be curious to see it as well!","

I'm not typically a fan of musicals and usually avoid them but I thought this movie worked as a musical. My only complaint is that I watched the trailer beforehand and there was no indication of this movie being a musical which is frustrating when you go to the theatre expecting one thing and you get something completely different. Why can't trailers just say it's a musical?? I probably wouldn't have gotten tickets if I had known that. Despite it being a musical I did enjoy the movie but I probably wouldn't watch it again. It had some good moments but the signing was a bit corny at times. If you don't like musicals I would avoid this movie or maybe wait for it to come out on streaming so you can skip through the singing bits.","

"Wonka","thekarmicnomad","29 January 2024","This has a lot of things going for it - great cast, good performances, production and clearly some love was invested in making this.The result is a fine movie - but nothing fantastic.I think this is a children's film as oppose to a family movie.There is not much of a plot: stuff just happens and when a problem seems too difficult to tackle Willy literally pulls the solution out of his hat.This leads to a lot of silliness that kids will probably appreciate.The songs are ok but I have forgotten them already.The sets are interesting but the CGI feels oppressive.There is some great acting (especially Coleman) but most of the charters are pretty shallow.Whereas the original was about shunning greed, gluttony and selfishness - this seems to be about solving everything with magic and chocolate.Got a problem? Eat this sweet and it will make you big or small or strong or whatever you need.Got no money or any place to sleep? Eat a chocolate.I think too much was put on Calah Lane's shoulders - she gives a sterling effort but it is such a big part to put on such a young actor - and in a lot of places it shows.","

"Wonka","ethanbresnett","8 December 2023","Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.","

"Wonka","Jithindurden","8 December 2023","I've always liked Timothee Chalamet's performances. Even when he did things exceptionally, it felt like he was really good at that but still not enough for me to love him as an actor. There's a certain charm that I find in actors I grow to love and I found that in him here. Chalamet is brilliant as well as the rest of the cast. I didn't know Olivia Coleman was in this, and even though I recognized her face, I couldn't place her. She looks much younger here as the evil Mrs. Scrubbit and have a completely different body language that I couldn't place her till the credits came on screen, brilliant. Paul King has made this as sweet and optimistic as the Paddington films, even though it does have the darkness of the Wonka world. The movie doesn't dwell on those dark moments, it quickly follows them up with optimism. The songs were great and the older songs used were such fantastic placements. Willy Wonka is yet to be truly betrayed by people and he has the innocence and purity here and that works perfectly. Whatever problems I had must be things that aren't even part of what they meant to tell through this movie. This worked fantastically as a prequel to the 1971 movie.","

"Wonka","df4205","7 February 2024","Much like the Mary Poppins follow-up, this prequel to the much loved Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory falls flat at worst and mediocre at best. While it's not a horrible film, it falls well short of the bar set by the original staring Gene Wilder. Walking in the footsteps of a legendary, beloved classic is a near-impossible task as it is, but this film barely seems to try.The Music/Songs:The problem with modern day musicals, this one included, is that they're not songs - they're conversations set to a tune. While they sometimes meet the technical requirements of rhyme, getting there is quite ponderous as they fail badly in terms of meter. By the time a character has finished singing one sentence, I could've listened to three songs from the original. This, I think, is why the songs are largely unmemorable because each one requires us to essentially learn ""Modern Major General.""Compared to the original, these songs also seem largely lacking in point. Whether, as many others point out, they're far too frequent or some other reason, they just don't inspire a person to sing along. The original songs either gave us insight in to the character's state of mind, they're foibles, or their comeuppance. Here, its more like ""Ow, I stubbed my toe! It really hurt! I'll be walking funny all day!""The Characters:Grandpa Joe, Charlie, Veruca, and Willy are all timeless, well-known and had time to be explored/fleshed out. Heck, even the one-shot people like the scientist with the machine telling him it couldn't cheat and the psychiatrist demanding his patient tell him where a dream told him a ticket was had more personality and are more memorable than most folks we see here. The villains are cartoonish caricatures lifted right out of a Neil Breen film - Twirling their mustaches, talking openly about how evil they are, and doing incomprehensibly stupid things like keeping records of their misdeeds.Though Timothée Chalamet seems a capable actor, the writing for Willy Wonka doesn't give him much to work with. Here, Willy is presented as an ever-jolly fellow, constantly smiling and looking on the bright side of life. Does that seem even remotely like the enigmatic, wise-cracking, flippant, wise, distant, playful, fun-loving, often enraged and borderline psychotic Willy portrayed by Gene? The fun of the original Willy was that he could be all those things because from the time he 'fell' off his cane and did a roll you learned you could never know what to expect out of him from one moment to the next. This incarnation just doesn't seem the same man who would show such unbridled rage as during his ""You stole fizzy lifting drink,"" speech. Yes, people can change, but we should have gotten at least a hint of one of these other moods/behaviors during the movie, just to show him as being capable of capricious behavior.Final Thoughts:I agree with those that have already said it, it's a nice looking movie. The visuals and effects are excellent, but is that enough to carry a film? The original didn't have things like CGI and even adjusting for inflation, the budget for the original is a penny in the cup compared to this one, yet I can watch the original again and again and again...this movie just isn't going to get the same kind of love and devotion. While the actors do what they can, the movie winds up being too ""sweet"" for it's own good. The original was accessible to both adults and children alike, this one seems to lean heavily towards favoring children. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but if you want your film to be timeless, you have to make it so adults aren't going to want to pull their hair out or to suddenly remember they need to cook a 2 and a half hour dinner.","

"Wonka","corinnedeberry","29 December 2023","Speaking as a massive fan of Paddington 1 and 2, Horrible Histories (OG) and Peep Show, when I saw the cast I was about as excited as it's possible to be about a film. But there was so much wrong with it. The plot (too predictable, too boring), the dialogue (unmemorable), the songs (terrible idea!), the pace (too hectic)... I won't go on.My kids (15 and 12) were so bored. My biggest complaint is that they wasted the talents of a dozen superb comedic actors. Why did they choose to focus on this bit of the Wonka story? Why not start at the beginning and explore what made him a genius/magician with a slightly twisted view of the world? Why give him a (predictable) dead mother as motivation? Why not give Hugh Grant's character a bigger role?Simon Farnaby and Paul King were incredible on Paddington, so I can only assume they were forced to make a lot of compromises, or write this in a hurry. I genuinely don't know who this was written for but I hope there isn't a sequel! The only positive is that visually it looks great.","

I'm happy I had no expectations and no pre conceptions.The main actor and the rest of the cast are great, so is the story and everything else.

"Wonka","SnoopyStyle","24 January 2024","Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives in a big European city with little more than a dream to open a magical chocolate shop. He signs a bad contract with Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) and is forced to do laundry. He befriends little orphan Noodle who is similarly trapped. He struggles to sell his chocolates against a trio of establishment chocolatiers who have a stranglehold on the corrupt police.Sure, the 1971 movie has plenty of songs and a couple of them are iconic. I was not expecting a musical, but I wasn't surprised either. It is telling that the best songs here are redoing the old icons. I don't remember any of the other songs. This is adapting Willy Wonka to Broadway musical Annie. Chalamet is not quite Gene Wilder. Who is? There is a missed opportunity here. The movie actually gave me a great idea early on. Wonka is imagining his chocolate shop with pedestrians dancing away. In reality, it's all in his head. This world should be a Dickensian hell scape, but he sees the magical world underneath. That's what I want for this movie. As it stands, this is not going to be remembered like the iconic original.","

But neither over shadowed Wonka and Noodle who were fantastic. I'm a 43 year old man and I left the theater smiling. It's a feel good movie that brings out the inner child. It's nice to escape for a couple hours from a world that seems very broken. Leave your adulting at the door and just have a good time.","

Johnny Depp wasn't good at all and this version was a little bit better.I love Hugh Grant but I feel like he would be or should be embarrassed to be in this movie. Even for Rowan Atkinson, is he struggling for money and needs to take what he can get? For having A grade actors, the factoring wasn't that great.Feel the 1971 version that didn't have the technology we have today, had better graphics than this movie. The whole movie felt cheap or on a severe budget. You can tell they didn't put much effort in the cgi. For a 2023 movie, you would expect more.The music was not even catchy. It made you feel like the music should stop. At best this movie is a feel good movie but nothing more. It's great for kids but nothing compared to the Original Movie.","

the ideal fit for any Willy Wonka movie. His portrayal felt artificial, lacking genuine movements and dialogue, appearing too slender and immature for the role.However, the film showcased commendable scenography, audiovisual resources, storytelling, songs, and most characters were well-cast. A standout was Hugh Grant; in my opinion, he brought the Oompa Loompas to life and saved the movie.It was an interesting approach to Wonka's early life, but in my opinion a musical like this one erase the most important part of Willis's world: the madness.","

Race swapped characters. Disjointed cast. Sloppy story line. Dark and dingy grading. Forgettable music. Embarrassing script. There was soooooo much wrong with it that I can't simply list it all. I literally can't remember when my family was last enchanted by a movie. Incredibly disappointed, could have been something special.

Depp's was too tied up in the simile with Michael Jackson that it was just creepy and unpleasant, and I say that as a huge fan.We go back decades in the Wonka world to this film and we find a young man who is softer and kinder. This all makes sense.The casting is insanely brilliant, the pacing spot on, the script bonkers and wonderful with so many deft touches. The sets beautiful, the CGI well-managed and the music is simply amazing. We're still humming them all today and will be for years to come. Bravo Hannon and Talbot.Do a few of the actors need their singing a little digitally-corrected? Yes. But in a world of Wonka gloss and magic, I think that's a tiny criticism given what a wonderful, magical world it creates and how it fleshes out the Wonka story in such a respectful fashion that I think Dahl would be delighted with.And, wow, Calah Lane... watch her go places.","

Classic!I love these types of films that awaken our sense of whimsy and have us harkening back to our childhood.I just saw it, so I am not going to say more until I watch it for another time and consider things like camera angles and editing which is all about the directors vision, which I also love to consider.I gave this a 10.","

They all fulfilled their roles very well. The script is pretty average, although it has a few shining parts. The main material is very suitable for high quality work without any boundaries in terms of scenario, stage art and musicality. The main work, Charlie's Chocolate Factory, is a work about pushing the limits of imagination. Even though there were a few fantastic elements in the movie, it felt quite weak to me in this aspect.

Wonka looked already rich and successful guy from the beginning which was funny. Western people seem to like the first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I like the second one the best.

Unfortunately, as an adult, it ends up being quite difficult not to be critical of some aspects of this film.To get the positives out of the way, the entire production and costume design are outstanding, and when the story takes its time to explore Wonka and his quirky inventions, the creativity is, without a doubt, a standout (wish there was more of it!). A highlight is the shop scene with the yeti tears.Other than that, the story just didn't quite manage to engage me. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but overall, I didn't feel drawn in. The characters all seemed quite cartoonish and over-the-top in their mannerisms and dialogue, which struck me as odd since the original (to which this one is a spiritual prequel) is grounded in realism despite its fantastical elements. The Chocolate Cartel, Bleacher, and the Chief of Police are all examples of this-uninspired and one-dimensional.I don't want to be overly critical, knowing I'm probably not the target audience, but the songs were also forgettable, both lyrically and melodically. Finally, I wish the film hadn't relied on visual effects as much, as it ended up contributing even more to the lack of realism and made it harder for me to feel immersed. It all felt too fake.I guess that all pretty much summarizes my thoughts. I did have a few laughs and was marveled at times by the creativity put on screen, but at the same time couldn't connect as much as I had liked to the story and its characters.I still do recommend it though, worth a watch nonetheless.","

Basically, aspiring magician, inventor and chocolate maker Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Timothée Chalamet) arrives in the big city to seek his fortune and open a chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He quickly burns through his small savings and finds a laundry/boarding house to stay the night. But the owner Mrs. Scrubitt (Olvia Colman) is a devious woman, along with her henchman Bleacher (Tom Davis). Orphan girl Noodle (introducing Calah Lane), who stays at Scrubitt's, warns Willy to read the small print, but he is illiterate and signs the contract regardless. Wonka is confident that he can draw in customers for his chocolate at the Galeries Gourmet and sells his ""hoverchocs"" which make those who eat them fly. The three main chocolatiers of the galleria, Mr. Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Mr. Fickelgruber (The Wrong Mans' Mathew Baynton), mock Wonka's chocolates but are secretly impressed by their taste and his ingenuity and see him as a threat to their business. They call the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key) who confiscates his earnings. Unable to pay Scrubitt, Willy is consequently forced to work down in the launderette for up to 10,000 days (27 years) to pay his debt. The other workers trapped in Scrubitt's basement are accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), telephone operator Lottie Bell (EastEnders' Rakhee Thakrar), comedian Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Abacus tells Willy that Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelgruber are the ""Chocolate Cartel"" and are in cahoots to eliminate any competition. The Cartel's base of operations is located beneath a cathedral, run by the corrupt Father Julius (Rowan Atkinson) and his ""chocoholic"" monks, where they store a large container of chocolate. Wanting to get out and satisfy the public with his chocolates, Willy plans to distract Scrubitt and Bleacher, manipulating them into falling in love with each other, so that he can sneak out, with the help of Noodle. On his first trip out, Willy is successful in making sales, but the Chocolate Cartel exploits the Chief's love of chocolates to threaten Wonka into leaving town. Willy ignores the warning and continues to sell chocolate, becoming a sensation with the public. Noodle teaches him how to read, and he avoids the police using magic tricks, and sewage drains as escape routes. After introducing Noodle to her first piece of chocolate, Willy explains that his love for chocolate came from his mother (Sally Hawkins), who made him one last chocolate bar before she passed away. Willy has told Noodle that various times he has made chocolate, his jars have been stolen by a mysterious ""orange man"", who has been stalking him for years, but she does not believe him. One night, Willy and Noodle travel to the local zoo to milk a giraffe to create his signature chocolate using Giraffe milk. The two of them recruit Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie to help him sell chocolates to pay their debts while evading Scrubitt and the Chief. Meanwhile, Willy catches the ""orange man"" who has been stealing his chocolates, an Oompa-Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Years ago, Willy took precious cocoa beans from Loompa Land, which Lofty was watching, and he wants Willy to pay him back in chocolate. Willy's group earns enough money to open his dream chocolate store in the galleria to an excited crowd. However, the Chief and the Chocolate Cartel have got wind of this, and they tell Scrubitt about what they have been up to. The Cartel spoils his chocolates, putting yeti sweat into them, causing customers to grow excessive hair and discolour their skin. The angry crowd demand their money back, ransack the place, and cause Wonka's store to burn down. Returning to the launderette, the Cartel confess their sabotage of his business and make Willy an offer. They will pay off all the debts of his friends, and give Noodle a future if he leaves town and stops making chocolate forever. Willy reluctantly accepts the offer and boards a boat that night. Lofty joins Willy aboard the boat and motivates him to return and fight back against the Cartel before they abandon ship after finding a bomb set to explode. With their debts paid, Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie are released from the launderette, but Slugworth pays Scrubitt to refrain from releasing Noodle. Willy returns and his group rescue Noodle; Willy discovered she is the daughter of Slugworth's dead brother. Noodle's mother left her with Slugworth, but he realised she could claim the family fortune when she grows up. Slugworth dumped his niece with Scrubitt and lied to her mother that she had died. Willy and his friends put together a plan to expose the Cartel using an accounts book Abacus had spotted when he worked for Slugworth. Releasing the giraffe into the cathedral as a distraction, Willy and Noodle go beneath ground to find the book but are cornered by the Cartel. They are trapped in the container where they are to be drowned in chocolate. Before entering, Willy asks the Cartel to give a jar of hover chocs to the Oompa-Loompa to repay his debts, but the three men and Father Julius eat the chocolates, and Lofty appears and rescues Willy and Noodle. Confronting the Cartel and the Chief outside, Willy and Noodle expose their actions to the police and the public revealing the contents of the account book, and their chocolate is released through a water fountain, ruining their business. The Cartel uncontrollably levitates due to the hover chocs, while the Chief of Police is arrested. The crowd celebrates by tasting the chocolate containing Willy's ingredients. Willy unwraps his mother's chocolate bar, finding a golden ticket with a last message from his mother telling him that chocolate is best shared. Willy shares his mother's chocolate with his friends. Willy helps Noodle reunite with her birth mother, Dorothy Smith (Tracy Ifeachor), who works in the library. Willy pays off his debt to Lofty, but he says he could do with some help when he opens a new factory, he needs a ""Chief Taster"". Willy purchases an abandoned castle and with Lofty helps to build the Wonka factory. Meanwhile, Scrubitt and Bleacher are arrested trying to hide evidence of sabotaging Wonka's shop, and eating his chocolates, they are turned into the Twits. Also starring Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Officer Affable, Simon Farnaby (also writing) as Zoo Security Guard Basil, Charlotte Ritchie as Barbara, Phil Wang as Colin, Ellie White as Gwennie (Mistress of the Keys), Sophie Winkleman as The Countess, Murray McArthur as Ship Captain, Peep Show's Isy Suttie as Fruit & Veg Vendor, Colin O'Brien as Young Willy Wonka, Rufus Jones as Jenkins, Tim Fitzhigham as Sinister Ship Captain, Susie Fairfax as Abacus Crunch's Wife, Coronation Street's Ian Bartholomew as Sceptical Old Man, Justin Edwards as Green-Skinned Customer, Miranda's Dominic Coleman as Donovan, and Alison Pargeter as Wendy Chucklesworth. Chalamet is likeable as the aspiring constantly positive upcoming candy man, Colman and Davis are a great double act as the mean workhouse owners, Joseph, Lucas and Baynton enjoy themselves as the pantomime villains, young Lane gives a confident performance as Wonka's assistant, and Grant as the pompous wisecracking little creature is hilarious, spotting recognisable acting and comic talents is the cast is fun as well. There are some nice songs written by The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, including ""A Hatful of Dreams"", ""You've Never Had Chocolate Like This"" and ""A World of Your Own"", and the return of classic songs ""The Oompa-Loompa Song"" and ""Pure Imagination"" with slightly altered lyrics is good. As an origins story for the young chocolate factory character it works well, it is full of likeable characters, a charming Dickensian atmosphere, with colourful costumes and set pieces, there are some good laughs to be had, the family will all have fun with this little bite of magic, a sweet and enjoyable musical fantasy. Very good!","

"Wonka","tvpvdbh","28 December 2023","Wonka was fine. I mean, it was good. I expected to be annoyed, and I wasn't in the slightest. It's well written, well directed, very good acting all around, uniformly by everyone. The songs are clever. Very appealing characters and a solidly written story. Timothée Chalamet is super charming as Willy Wonka, breezy and fun. I enjoyed Calah Lane as Noodle. She really grounds the whole movie with a believable combination of weary cynicism, unexpected wonder and hope. Olivia Coleman is a great villain, had a lot of fun. Keegan Michael Key, Matt Lucas, I mean, the entire cast is solid.Part of the problem is that, despite the seeming high stakes of the story, not very much seemed at stake. Willy Wonka is so breezy and so easily inventive, there's never any doubt that he's going to be ok. In fact, because it's a prequel, it's guaranteed he's going to be ok because he's destined to build that chocolate factory, after all. In the original, it was Charlie who had everything at stake, and you felt it. In this one, it should have been Noodle. But as she is the secondary character, her story can't be the central, driving one, even though hers is the story, as written, with the most at stake. In the context of this movie, however, her story is too tied to his for it to ever feel like the outcome of her story was in doubt.I left feeling, well, that was nice. Lots of good stuff. Solid. But Willy Wonka should be magic. And for whatever reason, the magic and wonder or giddy fun didn't happen for me. I liked it WAY better than Tim Burton's version, which I hated. But this chocolately treat, while well made and tastey, failed to lift me off my feet.","

"Wonka","movieman6-413-929510","10 December 2023","Wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. This prequel was directed and partly written by Paul King, the director of the two Paddington films.Young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. When he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, Willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. This cartel is run by Slugworth (Patterson Joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.Together with Noodle (Calah Lane) and the fellow residents of Willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against Slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from Willy Wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .
The book adaptation of Roald Dahl, his book about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. They managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. What further made this film unique was the acting of Gene Wilder, who managed to make the role of Willy Wonka his own with his own creative input.In 2005, the film was remade with Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. This remake was directed by Tim Burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.Now with this prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Timothée Chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. Unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. As a result, the younger version of Willy Wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. Timothée Chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to Gene Wilder's singing. Fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as Calah Lane.In the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for Willy Wonka's character to emerge in the film. In this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. In the beginning you follow Willy Wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. This gives the film a different atmosphere. Once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. However, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. In the original film, Willy Wonka's helpers, the Oompa Loompas, were played by small actors. In this film, an Oompa Loompa is played by Hugh Grant, who is transformed into Oompa Loompa with special effects. This way, credibility is lost somewhat. Sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. Because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.This way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. Furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of Timothée Chalamet.","

"Wonka","kjproulx","26 January 2024","It was hard for me to not have some small expectations going into Wonka, simply because I am a huge fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. That original film from 1971 is a film I grew up watching many, many times. When I was younger I also liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I have since grown a distaste for it. In my eyes, after that Johnny Depp version, there was nowhere to go but up. I'm very happy that I got around to checking out Wonka though because it was just wonderful to watch. Far different from the other versions, here's why I recommend this one.Willy Wonka, a young man with aspirations of opening his own chocolate factory, works his way up the chain at a job that pays him almost nothing. With the help of some newfound friends, he may just have what he needs to get started. Sadly, he is being hunted by what the film calls ""The Chocolate Cartel,"" a group of people who wish to take Wonka down. His magic and wonder are too much for them and that scares them. This film is silly through and through. The villains all made me roll my eyes on multiple occasions, but Wonka was meant to be a family film and it more than succeeds at that.Even though I was watching this film based on the name alone, Paul King was the second reason. His writing and directing on both Paddington films was stellar. Those films are delightful and not only made for kids, but the emotional core and overall messages make them worth watching, and I feel the same way about Wonka. It's a fun, charming family film, but the way the film wraps up at the end had me in tears. It focuses on a lot of silliness to keep kids engaged, but I truly feel that adults will get more than they think out of the emotional ending, as well as the references to the original classic film (especially in the music).I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this film is first and foremost, a musical. The trailers don't exactly portray it as such, but there are quite a few musical numbers. I thought the musical aspect added to this film and brightened it up many times. Timothée Chalamet is also fantastic in the role, but he's great in everything, so I wasn't surprised there. If you're looking for a simple film that is fun and will likely put a smile on your face, look no further than Wonka. I would gladly watch Chalamet in a sequel to this.","

"Wonka","hreghen","29 December 2023","This film has some charming and creative elements but essentially all the great parts came from mining Roald Dahl's creativity and not from original thoughts. This origin story didn't really many details of Wonka's past or tell an interesting or nuanced story. A young Wonka is thwarted by over-the-top enemies who are outrageously cruel.There were too many songs and too many attempts at heartfelt 'Disney' moments that would surely have made Dahl cringe.There was a totally unnecessary subplot involving corrupt priests that could only be seen as a vulgar attack on the Catholic Church.Chalamet was very good in the title role and Olivia Coleman delivered the sought of broad comedy she was known for before her surprising Oscar triumph in The Favourite. Hugh Grant, and his clipped English accent, made the Oompa Loompa character amusingly memorable.There was too much focus on the Noodle character. Oodles of Noodle was too much.Just watch the 1971 version. It's the best.","

The plot is unbelievably formulaic and predictable even for a kids film .. going well, setback, going well, setback. It's unimaginative and there are several glaring plot holes! Why did the giraffe not have any udders? Why did they keep going back to the place they were imprisoned despite the police being after them anyway? Also why did they even need the giraffe milk, the giraffe milk chocolate just went to an extra irrelevant to the plot.. in the next scene they magic'ed a whole shop load of chocolate.","

"Wonka","chukkacabra","23 January 2024","I liked the original, but after the extremely underwhelming Johnny Depp reboot, I was skeptical to say the least about Wonka. I was not disappointed.Fun, humorous, creative, colorful, Wonka was way better than I could have predicted. Timothee Chalamet showed a quick-witted side of Willy Wonka that not even Gene Wilder could top. Wonka was exuberant and flashy, but not over the top. The Oompa-Loompas dawned the same orange skin green hair from the original and the iconic Oompa-Loompa music that the reboot butchered. The ""Chocolate Cartel"" was a laughable villain, but Slugworth (finally getting screentime) was a truly despisable antagonist.Wonka was a great watch for me, and I highly recommend that you watch it with your children (if you're old) or your parents (if you're young), or at least a dog or cat.","

The plot was predictable and simple, i feel like for this one the problem isn't complicated enough and wonka seems too naive, yet somewhat it what makes it feels really special. It is very different from the previous two movies, and it is refreshing but still feels nostalgic. I was laughing, and crying (of course) and i usually find musical movies boring, but i love every single song here. Timothee and those other great actors hit those note delicately. My inner child was filled with so much happiness. Overall it's a perfect holiday movie.","

It's a wonderful film full of likeable characters; endearing performances; a heartfelt story; whimsical, storybook-like direction (like the Paddington films); memorable songs and brilliant musical sequences with fun choreography; colourful, immersive visuals and production design; and most importantly, lots of chocolate! Timothée Chalamet was perfectly charming as Willy Wonka and proves once again that he is easily the best actor of his generation - I loved seeing him in a happy role for once. Paul King and the rest of the team from the Paddington movies made an instant holiday classic and a truly magical time at the movies! Yeah, it's no perfect film, but when faced with a movie as warm and delightful as this... who cares? Wonka is a wonderful movie that is perfect to see with family and friends this holiday season! I absolutely loved this charmingly entertaining film, it'll have you smiling from ear to ear and leave you feeling great afterward! It's so joyful and full of life! King and Chalamet, to no one's surprise, knocked it out of the park - Chalamet surprised with his singing ability and King proved he was made to direct musicals!

"Wonka","d_penn","25 February 2024","It wasn't until after I watched the movie that it was brought to my attention that this adaptation was based off the book, so I'm gonna quickly clarify that this review is with the opinion of someone who hasn't read the book. Going into it I didn't know it was gonna be a musical, which makes sense cause usually if movies are marketed as musicals they are quickly gonna fail, but to be tricked into watching it didn't seem fair especially since the songwriting was awful. Storytelling wasn't bad at all. The pace was great and I loved the balance between flashbacks and present day. If you focused on the non-diegetic sounds, you could easily foreshadow what's happening next. So yes, it's predictable, but for a Childs film it's 'cute'. Do I recommend this movie, not sure considering the fact that I never read the book, so please read that first and then make the decision of whether its worth sitting through the musical version. Now, because while watching this movie, I did compare it to the original movies we all grew up on. Those other movies are far more superior. Literally nothing could compare to the beautiful minds creating those films. This version felt too forced with the screen play and song writing. They tried too hard to make Wonka feel 'quirky' to the point where he felt annoyingly irritable. Now I believe if they wrote it differently it would've been a masterpiece, but it is what it is. Lastly, the only decent song in this movie was the cover of ""pure imagination"", which says a lot because they didn't even write that song for this movie, it was simply an homage to the original. That was also the only song I believe Timothee sung well.*not a big fan of musicals so it was okay.","

"Wonka","gsanvin","31 December 2023","Wonka is not a bad film. It is well acted and filmed but if you are looking for a memorable backstory to the beginning of Wonka's factory from the original movie you won't find it as it's not there.First of all kudos to the cast. I felt everyone in the film played their roles very well. No faults to be found there at all. Beyond that it gets messy.The biggest sin is the incredibly unoriginal innkeepers and their list of charges for the stay.... Hello, are you doing a Willy Wonka backstory or a remake of Les Miserables?Willy Wonda the magician or chocolate maker? This show makes him look like more of a magician. He pulls an endless array of items out of his hat ala Mary Poppins' carpetbag. This does not jive with the source material.Slugworth in this film resembles a Bond villain more than a rival chocolatier. He even puts Wonka and Noodle in a Bond Villain type death trap. Again Is this a Wonka backstory or the next Bond film?Even with all of these faults, it's still watchable but it's largely unoriginal and makes no sense with any source material. I gave it a generous 7 out of 10.","

Surprisingly, I enjoyed it and found it very charming and reminiscent of old fairy tales. The acting was very good. Timothy Chalamet was so endearing that I made me rewatch Dune. Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa? Whose idea was that but it worked. I scored it an 8 because it's a Musical. Sorry. I was never a big fan of Wonka #1 and found Wonka rather mean. The remake with Johnny Depp was not much better. I think I liked this one more because there's a certain pathos to the story.","

"Wonka","DanLawson146","26 December 2023","POSITIVES:1) Timothée Chalamet is absolutely brilliant here. The singing, dancing, charm and emotion are all present in abundance and I really wasn't expecting him to be so great
2) I thought the songs were very good and the dance choreography that accompanies a lot of them was also very impressive. ""A world of your own"", ""Pure imagination"", ""For a moment"" and ""Sweet tooth"" were real highlights for me
3) As the title of this review suggests, I found the film to be incredibly heartwarming and endearing. I thought the friendship between Wonka and Noodle was extremely powerful and in general I just thought the whole film made me feel better about the world and come out of the cinema with a spring in my step
4) Casting Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa was a stroke of genius. He's brilliant and his signature level of wit and sarcasm still shines throughNEGATIVES (all very small and nitpicky):1) Chalamet's line delivery at times was too cringey for me; ""land ahoy"" and ""absolutely insane"" are the two examples that immediately spring to mind
2) The character of Larry the comedian was so annoying and just felt completely unnecessary
3) There were a couple of times where characters throw and catch things and the cutting / editing of those moments was poor
4) I understand that it's a kid's film, but it always really bothers me in films when villains don't take the easy opportunity to finish off the hero. The chocolate cartel are completely okay with blowing up the boat Wonka is on when he tries to leave the city, but they don't shoot him when they're pointing a gun directly at him in their underground lair?? Instead they decide to slowly submerge him in chocolate instead for some reason??","

I looked up the director Paul King and he directed the Paddington, now that make total sense with the style.I'm not exactly a huge fan of musicals, some of the are cringe to me.

"Wonka","fciocca","14 January 2024","""Wonka"" tells the origins of the famous chocolate maker telling how his small business started. The staging is dreamy, but also grimy, creating a wonderful mix of different styles that merge well together. The directing of Paul King perfectly captures the mood of the film. The symmetry of the sets makes some sequences extremely engaging. The CGI is overall good and it blends seamlessly with the real environments. Unfortunately the oompa loompas played by Hugh Grant did not look up to today's VFX standards. I can pass over this issue, considering that in this film the character was very marginal, but in case of a sequel, this is an aspect that they definitely need to improve.As per tradition of every Wonka movie, this is a musical, and I truly enjoyed the songs that were very catchy and not too invasive, giving space to well written dialogues that made the story flow. I believe that the length of the movie was perfect, the film goes straight to the point. All the flashbacks displayed serve a purpose. This is how a fairy-tale is supposed to be: simple, short and sweet. I believe that this is one of those movies that both children and adults can watch and truly enjoy equally, and this for me is quite an achievement. Timothée Chalamet showed once again to be versatile and I believe that here shone, as he was able to demonstrate his skills as a singer and a dancer. Happy to see one of my all-time favorite actresses Olivia Colman, who was the comic shoulder, together with Tom Davis. I was glad to see Keegan-Michael Key who is always able to make me laugh, no matter the role. ""Wonka"" uses a lot of tropes, so the story is predictable. However it works, and not all movies need to be groundbreaking anyway. In my perspective it is definitely worth a watch, possibly to the cinema. This piece of art gets a solid 7.5 rate from me.","

"Wonka","beckwith-92198","25 February 2024","I had my doubts, but I put them aside to see this, and I'm so especially glad I saw Wonka in a theater. It exactly captures the happiness and wondrous feeling when I enter any candy store. Wonka successfully tells a new yet chronologically believable story of Willy Wonka's start-up while giving a tasteful homage to the classic original film and the work of author Roald Dahl. Anyone familiar with Dahl will see the iconic character styles and aesthetic sprinkled throughout. I particularly think of Mrs. Scrubit and Bleacher, being dark and ridiculous and exaggeratedly despicable caricatures like the Twits.On the more vibrant side, Chalamet brought such energy and heart to the role that a few times through the film I found myself fully believing that I was watching a young Willy Wonka. You have to remember that this is Wonka right at the beginning of his professional venture whereas the original 1970s film is literally depicting his retirement, so some differences in his tone and motivation are to be expected here.Wonka and the young girl, Noodle, have great on-screen presence together. The rooftop dance with the balloons was whimsical and touching like many moments in the movie, maybe being one of the my favorite feels. I liked the songs and all the actors were leaning heavily into their roles, no matter how oily or silly or dastardly or orange... haha.Wonka is not perfect (hence not 10/10), but this is not the original, it is not a remake of the original, and despite not being absolutely perfect, it should not be given a poor review because of infractions that are slight and few. I love the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and this Wonka felt completely worth the ticket and my time because it felt like it was worth the time and attention of the movie makers.","

The songs were catchy, beautiful set design and choreography. There was not a thing I could fault about it at all.

Remakes are always tricky in that regard. This was more of a kids movie than I had anticipated, nevertheless I enjoyed it all in all. I didnt really enjoy the musical numbers. The singing was satisfactory but never excellent. The costume design and colours of the Wonka world where great though. The most disappointing part of this movie for me was the plot. I was hoping to see how Willy Wonka became the Wonka as in how he built the chocolate factor and how he found the Oompa Loompas (which granted that was slightly touched upon). However, the plot was a completely new story featuring a girl named Noodle and a bunch of characters whose names I dont remember indebted to an unfair Inn owner played by Olivia Coleman. They try and try to escape with the help of Wonka and his chocolates. The story isnt bad at all but it was disappointing as I was expecting somethign that was very specific to Willy Wonka and rather the movie gave a story that I felt like I had seen before.","

I loved finding the little nods from the original and hearing that oh so familiar tune throughout. I may not know much about film making and such but I think it says something when you as a viewer can actually be swept away into a magical story like you used to as a child. I am excited that my daughter gets to grow up watching this magical film as I grew up with the original. *Chefs kiss*
Will likely be heading back to the theatre soon to watch it again.","

"Wonka","Tactrix","21 January 2024","So this movie did a lot of things right, they had the right general idea, they had a great cast, and they had amazing things in the way of wonders and compilations. And even though I hate musicals this one was one of the better ones for sure. So where did they miss? Ok first the story, it was about 90% dreary and 10% hope. That's not a ratio you ever want to see in a Wonka movie. Because it genuinely ruins the experience. You might think the first one had a similar ratio, but it didn't. The ratio in the first one was about 20% dreary to 80% hope. And that's one the main reasons it did so well.It's really depressing to see such a great cast and movie be ruined by something as stupid as ""let's fight greed as the plot."" The people who wrote this, have lost the thread of just how valuable not just saying that imagination matters is, but actually watching it is. Watching this movie was just watching someone attempt to be great and be repeatedly shut down until they became corrupt enough to play dirty enough to win. Which is not hope, it's just lazy. We deserve better, Wonka deserves better.6/10 bad plot and feel ruined what would have otherwise been a great movie.","

Some of the backstreet weren't that great, especially the oompa loompas.But there was a bunch of good stuff about it too. As much as I hate Timothee chalamet I do think he was perfect for this role. He was pretty much the right amount of silly and goofy that you need for a young willy wonka. Both Hugh grant and Matthew Baynton were really good. There was arguably too many songs but honestly I liked them. Especially Timothee chalamets version of pure imagination. Was definitely really fun. 8/10.","

"Wonka","Sperry23","29 February 2024","First things first. This is a film BASED on characters and situations from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, as interpreted in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It is a Musical. Timothee Chalamet's singing is OK, neither great nor grating. The songs are more 50's and 60's than current. Some are toe-tappers, but there's nothing to bring the house down.It's a Comedy. Nothing is really side-splitting but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments. There are several really good scenes, but overall, it's just generally amusing. The story line has enough twists and turns to be engaging, but is lightweight enough to be used as background for housework.Coming right down to it, the entire thing looks and sounds like a film adaptation of a stage production and little more.On the positive side, There are many homages to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory throughout as well as some to Gene Wilder himself. Many are very subtle. Much of the musical score is based the 1971 film.The cast is a fine ensemble with a number of excellent comedians and comic actors; including Keegan-Michael Key, Matt Lucas, Rowan Atkinson, and Hugh Grant. Chalamet shows his significant performing chops. Paterson Joseph makes for a delightful matinee villian and Keegan-Michael Key is a wonderful corrupt Chief of Police. Kalah Lane as Noodle is a brilliant young actor. She is definitely going far.When all is said and done, Wonka is enjoyable. It's what I call a Lazy Sunday Afternoon Film; an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. But it could have been so much more.","

"Wonka","vicocas","18 March 2024","The negative reviews hit the mark. The songs were unbearable, prompting me to skip them entirely. Timothee's portrayal of Willy fell flat, lacking the charisma needed to embody the character convincingly.However, amidst the disappointment, Hugh Grant shone brightly as the quirky Oompa Loompa. It's a shame his role was limited in the film, leaving people wanting much more from him.The climax felt rushed, leaving a desire for a more satisfying resolution. Trimming the forced and lackluster musical interludes could have allowed for a deeper exploration of the conclusion.It's frustrating to see potential ruined in the Hollywood film industry today, especially considering the likely substantial investment in this project.","

I think I like South Park Bigger, Longer, and uncut and Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd just to put into perspective of what musicals entertain me. I figured I'd give this a shot and more than likely shut it off. However, not only did I finish it. I finished it with a smile on my face. It brought back old memories of being a child and hearing those songs again after all these years. The set was amazing, the acting pretty much all of it took me back to a different time. I had fun and anytime a movie ends with me smiling I'm gonna say is a really good movie. I feel like watching the og now.","

"Wonka","paulclaassen","17 February 2024","Young Willy Wonka is an inventor and magician and has dreams of becoming a chocolatier. With no money and no place to stay, he ends up at the evil Mrs Scrubbitt's boarding house. Desperate, he signs a contract without reading the fine print, even after being warned by a young girl, Noodle, not to sign. As it turns out, Willy is illiterate.Not being able to pay the bill when he wants to leave, Mrs Scrubbitt locks Willy up in the basement together with a few other 'unfortunately tenants', who now does tasks around the house to ""pay off their debt"".'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' from 1971 starring Gene Wilder as the titular character had a fantastic production design, and a thought-provoking underlying theme. In 2005 the film was remade as 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. That film, too, revolved around a boy named Charlie, and the film had a much deeper meaning to it than the candy-coated façade it presented. This version of Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory relies heavily on visuals to captivate the audience. I found the story and the characters too slapstick - especially Mrs Scrubbit (even her very name!) and her henchman Bleacher, who were downright silly characters and aimed to entertain a young demographic.'Wonka' is beautifully theatrical, with an impressive production design and good visuals. They do attempt a deeper meaning to the film with regards to Noodle, but sadly it fell flat. There's so much slapstick and satire here that there's no room for a deeper underlying tone. This is by every definition a children's movie.","

"Wonka","PanDemic","27 February 2024","Granted, this movie has lowered the sense of danger compared to the book. It would maybe feel more like a true Roald Dahl experience if for example the outdoor winter had more of a bite; the cold never really bothered anyone. But as a family experience, this movie works in every way-and we all went home smiling.The visuals, the craftsmanship, the design of everything from chocolates to costumes; everything is delicious and wonderful. The song and dance sequences work well, and so does the dialog.The Gene Wilder version has in my opinion too many immersion-breaking moments that simply are too dated. This movie has just one: the synchronization of the body movement of the Oompa Loompa to the head of the amazing Hugh Grant (who is absolutely splendid, perfect).With a pinch more danger, and a perfectly animated ""orange man"" this could be a classic.","

"Wonka","southdavid","15 January 2024","I can't say I was particularly excited at the prospect of ""Wonka"", despite the Paul King / Simon Farnaby production team, and the trailer didn't inspire much positive thought either. However, it fit in timewise at the cinema one day, so I went and was very pleasantly surprised.Willy Wonka (Timothee Chalamet) arrives in town seeking to make his fortune as a chocolatier. His plans are initially thwarted though, by both the chocolate cartel, led by Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph) and then by Mrs Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) the unscrupulous owner of a local guesthouse. With the help of his fellow captives at Scrubitt's hotel, particularly Noodle (Calah Lane) Wonka tries to thwart the other chocolate providers, and a mysterious small orange man who occasionally steals his products, and establish a shop of his own.Utterly and relentlessly charming, is how I'd describe the film. It's a musical, in the same way the 1970's ""Willy Wonka"" was, and the songs, provided by Neil Hannon, are nicely done. It's very much a British version of this story, with the whole cast full of the cream of British comedy faces, even down to minor roles for Phil Wang, Isy Sutie, Ellie White and Charlotte Ritchie. Whilst there's not very much edge to the comedy, I did laugh quite a bit. Even Chalamet, who I do like in other films, but I feared was wrong for this role, does a good job.I don't necessarily buy much of a link between this version of the character and the Gene Wilder one though, so much so I wonder if there's half an eye on using a sequel to show what makes him a reclusive and blunt character. This is a really specific criticism, but it did seem to me that one plot point was entirely reverse engineered around Rich Fulcher's ability to do the voice of a man underwater, which is insane when you think about it.Those are the only real criticisms though in what was a pleasant surprise for me and one I look forward to seeing again in the future.","

"Wonka","joesabin-76663","9 March 2024","First off, this is a musical, regardless of what the official word is on it. Second, most of the actors can't really sing, they are OK, but they aren't singers. The filming of it is rather spectacular in its colors and cinematography, but there seems to be nothing funny, only a bit bizarre and oddball. Not sure what they were attempting to do with this movie, but it falls flat in my opinion. I was squirming in my seat after the first 30 seconds. I admit I didn't watch the whole movie, I would not have been able to stand it. Studios need to stop making sequels, prequels, and redos of movies that have been successful. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was brilliant. This movie is not, it's not even close to the second try at it. Gene Wilder is still Willy Wonka. I was kind with giving it five stars. It deserves two.","

Tom Davis in a lederhosen and a mini silk kimono holding a tiny tea cup and saucer will continue to make me chuckle... brilliant. Paul King and Simon Farnaby's script is perfection for me re the details of the jokes and characters, it just made me smile from ear to ear. The literalness of Matt Lucas's character, the heaving at the word poor by Mathew Baynton... I think this film is definitely for adults... children will like the music and the giraffe but the adults will enjoy the sublime humour. A feel good movie for all. And no it doesn't matter that Wonka is not yet the jaded eccentric Wonka of the Gene Wilder film. Chamalet smashes it out of the park. More from Paul King and Simon Farnaby pls.","

"Wonka","IonicBreezeMachine","27 December 2023","After seven years traveling abroad looking for exotic flavors, aspiring chocolatier Willy Wonka (Timothee Chalamet) arrives in Europe eager to establish himself. While his chocolates prove immensely popular, a trio of chocolatiers consisting of Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton) use their connections with the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key) to force Willy away from selling chocolate. With no means of selling his wares, Willy winds up in a massive amount of debt at a boarding house run by Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis) and forced to work in their laundry to work off his debt. With the help of Scrubitt's orphaned ward Noodle (Calah Lane), Wonka and his assortment of friends who are also debtors of Mrs. Scrubitt craft a plan to upend the chocolate cartel.Wonka is the third theatrical incarnation of the characters from Roald Dahl's 1964 children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory following the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the first to not be directly based upon the book. Development on a new Willy Wonka film began in 2016 when Warner Bros. Reacquired the rights to the Wonka character from Dahl's estate with the intention later revealed to be making the film a prequel to the 1971 film detailing Wonka's origins. Paul King was selected as director based on the success of his work with the Paddington films, and even reteamed with some of his collaborators from Paddington 2 on writing the screenplay. Critical and audience reception has been very positive with Wonka also being credited with revitalizing the movie musical genre which has struggled at the box office since 2020. Wonka is a very sweet and agreeable film that tries to do right by the source material, even if it's placement as a prequel is somewhat undercut by its portrayal of the titular Wonka.From a purely technical point of view, Wonka is a gorgeous looking film. The production is certainly to be commended as the nameless European city in which Wonka takes place feels timeless and is rich in details from the busy din of the Galleries Gourmet to the purposefully unpleasant Scrubbit & Bleacher that carries more than a few shades of Roald Dahl's The Twits, Wonka creates a world that is beautiful and sweet while still possessing a bit of Dahl's signature edge and bite. The movie also features a bevy of notable British character actors in major or supporting roles with the likes of Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, and Olivia Colman being but a few whose presence adds to the engaging nature of the world created. Keegan-Michael Key is very funny as the corrupt Chief of Police who does the chocolate cartels bidding, and a running gag about how he's bribed in chocolate is very amusing and very Dahl like. But stealing every scene he's in is none other than Hugh Grant who plays Oompa-Loompa Lofty and his relationship with Wonka and how he came to be involved is very amusingly done with a rendition ""Oompa Loompa"" repurposed from 1971 original.I think this does lead into one of the weak points with the movie which is the soundtrack. While all the music is fine and sounds and looks good in the moment, I think the lack of differentiation among the presentation of the songs prevents any of them from standing out in a big way and it speaks volumes how the songs Pure Imagination and Oompa Loompa from the original film are included here and overshadow the new ones. We also have Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka and while he has a likable and engaging screen presence, I never felt like he was going to become Gene Wilder's Wonka from the 1971 film. While thankfully Chalamet's interpretation largely avoids the unnerving vision Burton and John August brought to the 2005 character, the Paddington influence really shows as Chalamet possesses all the whimsy you expect from Wonka but without the diabolical edge instead presented as a naive innocent dreamer to a fault. From the fact Wonka has a very pronounced motivation of fulfilling ""his mamma's dream"", his overly trusting and generous nature, and the fact he can't read it does feel like they've tried to copy that same Paddington feel to Wonka which I'm not sure is all that successful. Sometimes Chalamet is allowed to convey a more diabolical side to his character with his usage of stage magic and illusion to evade the police, but it's often overtaken by the focus on sweetness and innocence that Paul King and Simon Farnaby are more inclined towards.In terms of cinematic depictions of Willy Wonka, Wonka is a marked improvement from the 2005 film while not reaching the level of the 1971 original. While the film's production, atmosphere, and supporting performances are incredibly well done, the music is pleasant without standing out and Chalamet while likable in the lead role never sold me as an early version of Gene Wilder's take on the character. A pleasant enough experience especially if you enjoyed the Paddington films, but I don't expect to revisit Wonka in the same way I revisit Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.","

This film is more of a new adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel rather than a traditional prequel, however, so it stands well on its own.

"Wonka","mishahaynie","27 December 2023","This is a prequel to the original 1971 film and the 2005 Tim Burton remake. It's directed by the same director of the Paddington Bear movies. He manages to capture the love and fantasy of this Willy Wonka magically. It's not going to be anything compared to the original movies, but it's its own and it is delightful in every way. I was apprehensive about going to see this because I'm not a big Willy Wonka fan, but by the end of this movie, I think it really surpasses the previous films tenfold. I ended up loving it because it's full of heart. I think that's what a lot of movies forget nowadays. This movie was just full of passion and spirit. Roald Dahl and his family has been very apprehensive in the past about adapting his beloved books into movies, and without question, I think this is a wonderful recreation of his work. Timothée Chalamet really embodies the spirit of Wonka in his portrayal. Some essence of this performance can be a little odd, but he looks and fits the part very well. But the standout highlight performance of this movie that really knocked my socks off was Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. And yes, you heard that right. They CGI'd his head onto an Oompa Loompa body. I heard from sources, the director said he wouldn't have made the movie without Hugh Grant being a part of it for some reason, and it's one of the standout moments in the film that is just absolutely delightful. It makes it even more wacky and fun-spirited. If you want to take your family out to a really endearing movie that's going to lift your heart by the end and make you feel all bubbly and cheerful inside, definitely don't miss going to see Wonka! It will make your heart flutter with amazement!","

"Wonka","Reviews_of_the_Dead","27 December 2023","This was a movie that I'll was intrigued to check out. Growing up, I loved Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I've never seen the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton film all the way through, but it didn't work for me like the original. I also believe that I had a teacher in elementary school read the book to us as a class. Jaime was excited when this was coming to theater so we made a date night to check it out.What we get here is a prequel to the story we know. I'll credit that for the most part, this could lead to the Gene Wilder version. Timothée Chalamet looks like him. I could even make the case that this one is beaten down by the world to be Gene. What we get here though is that Willy Wonka arrives back in what seems like the business sector of the town where he grew up with his mother. He wants to try his hand at selling chocolates. Wonka is a bit gullible and is stopped by a cartel of chocolate makers. They're made up of Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton). The police are in on it, the chief is Keegan-Michael Key.Wonka is also taken advantage of by not reading the fine print of a local boarding house. It is run by Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman) with the help of Bleacher (Tom Davis), who is her muscle. Wonka is forced to pay his debts for staying there. It is here that he meets Noodle (Calah Lane), who tries to help him. Also working in the laundry with Wonka are Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher).It will take planning and guile, but Wonka is set to share his chocolate with the world, just like his mother wanted. It could be more difficult when there could be a little orange man taking his product and plus, he has to overcome the chocolate cartel as well as their network of bribes.What I'll say is that I had a blast here. Chalamet is a great Wonka. He can sing, dance and he's quirky to take on the role. I do love that he's navigating a world that takes advantage of him. Despite the odds, he does keep that chipper attitude that the character needs. What is interesting here though and I'll go back to something I said already, I could see him becoming the character from the beloved classic. I also like that character names share names with candy or other things in the Wonka world. The acting around Chalamet is great as well.Something else I appreciate here is that this movie made me laugh. It also put me in my feels with Wonka's backstory. Seeing what he has to go through to succeed also tugs at the heartstrings. There's also the story of Noodle trying to find out what happened to her family. Piecing that together brought a tear to my eye. There's also commentary here about capitalism that I appreciated. This is showing Wonka trying to break a monopoly on selling chocolate. It could be transferred to other things as well.Then to go over filmmaking, I love that this captures the spirit of Wonka. We also get a bleak and hard world so that split is great. It captures the heart of a Roald Dahl novel. There are fantastic things that you just have to accept. This does use CGI to bring that to life. In this day and age, not another way of doing it. There is money behind it so it looks good. I'll credit to that. This is a musical like every version. The songs aren't as iconic. I do think nostalgia is playing in there. What I will say is that I'm glad they did a version of the Pure Imagination song. That warmed my heart. I'll close this out by saying that if you love this story, give it a watch. I thought this was a worthy prequel to the original. It is a blast to watch.My Rating: 8 out of 10.","

"Wonka","Special-K88","22 January 2024","The third live-action adaptation of Roald Dahl's much beloved children's novel chronicles everyone's favorite candymaker in his early days as an ambitious, itinerant young chocolatier who arrives in Europe hoping to perfect his craft. Naturally his path to chocolate bliss takes some detours, and he has to finagle the rotten, beady-eyed proprietors of a boarding house, as well as the corrupt, imposing Chocolate Cartel if he hopes to make his fortune. Not bad but not especially memorable this offers its share of warmth and charm, featuring affable characters and a couple of likable songs, along with a few nods to Mel Stuart's 1971 version, plus a jolly, vigorous display from Timothée Chalamet who carries the role of a winsome, wide-eyed Willy Wonka with aplomb. Despite a good message and some sweet (no, not the candy kind) moments sewn in the final act is surprisingly ineffectual, but you'll probably like it even if you can't really love it. **½","

These initial moments adeptly set the tone of the film, unveiling the goals and first encounters of the iconic character.One of the film's great successes lies in its impeccable pacing that keeps the viewer's attention constantly engaged. My initial concerns of potential mismanagement of the precious memories from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory dissipated as the plot unfolded. Each scene is meticulously placed, contributing significantly to the final resolution, a sign of skillful and thoughtful writing.Wonka is not merely a sequel but a rebirth of the beloved universe. The film cultivates a feel-good atmosphere from start to finish, offering a welcome dose of music, smiles, humor, and delightfully quirky characters. It all merges into a cinematic symphony that delights the senses and nourishes the soul.The pleasure also lies in the in-depth exploration of Wonka's character, revealing his past and weaving a touching relationship with his mother. These elements add an emotional layer to the story, making Wonka not only eccentric but also a human and vulnerable figure.In summary, Wonka is a cinematic adventure that succeeds where many feared failure. It respects Roald Dahl's universe while offering a fresh and refreshing perspective. Paul King has created a work that celebrates the magic of cinema and the delights of chocolate, making Wonka a deliciously sweet and memorable cinematic experience.","

I didn't know that giraffes could produce milk like that. Now they can fly? That's so cool and fun.The musical parts are good but something is missing, i expected better songs and dancing. I would prefer something more catchy I guess. Its kinda funny that Wonka doesn't know how to read. I love how in this movie instead of money the police officers just want chocolate, it's funny. Someone poisoned the chocolates? Didnt see that coming but its funny. They are willing to give him so much money to quit and stop making chocolate? Wait is he gonna give up just like that? Wow, they tried to kill Wonka? That's so evil.Drama: 2/5
Comedy: 3/5
Fantasy: 4/5
Music & Dancing: 6/10Overall the movie is good but not great, it gets boring some times but it has its good moments too.. My rating is 7/10.","

"Wonka","rgkarim","16 December 2023","LIKES:The Setting
-We're back in the origins of the inventor, which means stepping back in time, and King's direction has executed tis well.-Glorious European design by trade brings an old timey delight that Wonka held long ago. Streets abuzz with society in these gorgeous streets of cramped alleys, large squares, and buildings that hold so much charm.-It provides that classic 1971 feel, but holds the Tim Burton charms and presentation at points to blend the world into a playground best for sharing candy treats.-As the movie progresses, the imagination comes to life to continue to give Dahl's extreme fantasy setting life, helping fill in with color, to what started as a very greyish world.The Costumes
-Adding even more personality are the various costumes that come into the works.-Certainly no Marvel or Star Wars, Wonka's elements again go back to tradition and matching the very evolution and practicality of fashion, as seen in various piece films.-The suits are straight and stiff, the dresses are flowing and conservative, but hold status, and the ""riff-raff"" have more character than the elite, that only continues to grow with each sale of chocolate.-And Wonka himself may not be the aura of personality like the other movies, but that traditional look is still there, has explanation, and like the others gradually shapes into the beginning of the madness.The Acting
-A solid cast to bring the life, King's recruitment of actors and actresses was delightful in bringing a Dahl story to life.-I'm going to focus on four in this cast, because the list is first billed, but be assured that King has brought together people to make a cast that fits in the Whimsical Wonka World.Keegan-Michael Key is a fun twist to his Christmas Movie on Netflix. He's a fun antagonist, gruff, but clumsy, using comedy as his forte to make things fun, and an expression that feels very child and goofy. Fantastic line delivery that felt like solid ad-libbing, he netted points for the fun feeling.Paterson Joseph as Slughorn is a fine leader of the Cartel. Malicious, conniving, greedy, and more fill his delivery with spice, but never quite losing that fairytale restraint for a movie to be too scary or loud in a kid's movie. An excellent blend of malice and silliness I expected.-Calah Lane a wonderful member who holds the heart and soul of Dahl's focus, the child aspect with adult lessons to learn. Lane brings a lot to her role as Noodle, a fantastic dreamer, but hard knock life delivery that is perfect for this movie. Her chemistry with Chalamet is spot on and I loved her engagement with the camera.-Of course Chalamet is the star and once again dips well into a movie with commitment, talent, and accuracy in getting an aspect of Wonka. He's charming, goofy, vulnerable, and inspiring all at once, and that hard combination is done well for much off the movie. Solid interactions, great physical acting, and that gleam he matches to Wilder's look long ago, quite chilling in just how good this guy is.The Story/Sentimentality
-It's a Dahl origin story, and while I don't know how much is from his notes and works, I must say it felt welcoming to the Wonka universe.-Wonka keeps to the writer's focus on fantasy worlds, good lessons, and the consequences that come from greed, all nicely portrayed in that same coy jab that we've seen.-Yet, the movie takes the musical element and starts to expand more on Wonka, adding these touching moments that Burton did that hold deeper ties and investment that further mold Wonka into something more.-And all while keeping it fun for kids, the stories that come together have sentimental value, and keep to elements of fun Wonka's world is known to have.The Music To A Degree
-It's a musical, and you need music. Fortunately, Wonka has you covered... at least to a degree.-The quality is spot on for a theater visit, great use of instruments, tight control over vocals, and a solid use of technology to get you into the number.-Each song does add that Dahl story telling twist, one part moral boosting, one part character examining, and plenty of parts aspiration and dreams that Wonka always sings for the audience.-There are touching piano solos, blends of splendid instruments blaring, and the numbers themselves have elements that feel like others, helping boost the themes and messages as only movies can.-That's the delight of the Wonka music to a reviewer and fan like me.The Special Effects
-Better than the original, technology evolution has done much to help make these worlds come to life.-Wonka, to me, feels like a theater show with special effects of the cinema, glorious sets that only computers and a studio can make to help add that immersion factor.-Several accidents have much better evolution than 1971, with chocolate, candy, and other delights matching that look of Burton's studio.-And to keep the animation looking real with what looks practical and CGI mixed, again a solid entry in my eyes that really just brings Dahl's words to life.The Comedy
-By far one of my favorite elements is the comedy. A blend of adult and kid humor that never crosses the line to inappropriate.-Wonka's stumbling and naivety, the sarcasm of Noodle, the idiocy of the constable and the villains... it all works in a nice balanced use to relieve the moments.-The winner is Hugh Grant, an Oompa Loompa with attitude, sarcasm, and quite honestly the most traditional Wonka charm of the bunch. Perhaps an influence to the latter, perhaps not, he was my favorite element in use that blends older humor tastes, with new generation flair.The Charming Feeling
-What ties it all together is the charm and delight of the Wonka-verse in this movie.-Paul King has done this tirelessly in his movies, and Wonka somehow has that youthful feeling that still speaks to the kid inside of me.-Like Paddington, this movie just holds so much, speaks so deep, and is just a fun escape that got me back into the movies and away from the Internet wars.-That's why this film has the heart and shininess to it, and makes for a good time out with groups at just how much the hope, inspiration, and struggles you can see without getting too lost in ""new directions.""DISLIKES:The Pacing Inconsistency
-There are times the movie is slow as molasses, slogging through awkward world building, and the first day struggles on the town.-Then there are times where it's like The Flash has taken over and achieved the impossible, or maybe shown how far work ethic has fallen.-Either way, Wonka's issue is time balance, editing that took out a lot and made an inconsistent up and down that could have had better use.-It's not the worst, but, I wonder what potential it had if these elements could have been extended or smoothed out on the story, numbers, and fun.The Plot Hole Issues
-Let's get this out, we don't know if this a true prequel or if this is a new start based on the Internet, so let's just focus on this movie.-Wonka's got great consistency, but again, there are things that don't make sense that I can't say too much to spoil.-Let's just say the crafting element seems a bit too fantasy, some of the building opportunities are a bit too fast, and the suspense of disbelief a tad more than what a Dahl story had.-I'd have liked to see time balance help iron this out, and perhaps more time to talk, but again, this movie was doing a lotMissing Wonka's Darker Wit
-Wonka is coy, sarcastic, and a bit of a darker and sterner side to his comedy. I missed that in this movie.-Yet, as this is before the infamous spy ordeal, I get why it might not be there and we only see the dreamer side.-Story aside, missing that sarcasm and that comedic spike was something I held, fortunately filled by the Oompa Loompa that would accompany about a third of the movie.The Music On Another Role
-By far the most disappointing to me, is the splendor of the music and the unique quality
-Frozen, Greatest Showman, La La Land, and others are better to me in terms of variety of musical numbers than this film, a shame given the potential of the director and the world.-Wonka's music is good quality, but many numbers start out the same, many have the same build up and opening, then kind of get different later in the song.-Not that they aren't good, but without the visual elements to help, the songs didn't have quite the portfolio of originality that I had hoped, leaving me disappointed that the musical element sort of flopped outside of the Wonka dream tone.The VERDICT
It may not be a dive into the factory, but Wonka turns out to be one of the most fun movies I've seen in a very long time. That whimsical nature and Paul King's direction, really blends youth and experience together diving back into the world that grabbed me at five years old. It's a quality world building and special effects use, enough to make the impossible, possible, but never overwhelm it. A family film with so much charm, it really was a fun dive into the origins and escapism that made a theater visit fun with the technology ad songs. Such a charming cast and tight direction made this movie worth every penny, and though missing some variety, some of that factory wit, and even a little more of the adult fortitude, Wonka accomplished a lot and made the whole experience super fun and engaging to say the least. I find this movie to be quite worth a recommendation, and hope that under King's direction, we get a few more installments into this world of Wonka. My scores of this musical melody movie are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5.","

"Wonka","joanaaguiar40","28 December 2023","This movie was charming, entertaining, sweet (pun intended) and there were also moments of great acting that didn't go unnoticed, however a couple of things absolutely threw me off/disappointed me.First of all, I really like Chalamet and I think he's a fine actor and he was very charming in this. However, he didn't fully incorporate or commit to the level of extravaganza, wittiness and lunacy that Willy Wonka the character asks for. Perhaps Depp's performance in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which I find absolutely outstanding, conditioned my viewing of Wonka, but even if both interpretations are supposed to be independent from each other, having seen Depp's, the bar was set really high for Timothee and he failed to hit the mark. I would have love to see that naïve lunacy Depp's interpretation had in this movie too.Second, I didn't like the songs. And this is a biggy for a musical. They weren't catchy enough, witty enough, and sometimes even the metric felt off. I think for a movie with this budget, something much more impressive could have been done.Finally, and this one isn't an actual critique because perhaps it doesn't have the right to be so, I didn't like the backstory about Wonka's childhood because it broke the magic for me as a viewer that loves the character across both films to have two different childhoods. Different childhood, different man. Moreover, Wonka's childhood in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lot more wicked and strange, a lot more Willy, and it also makes more sense regarding who Willy turns out to be as an adult. This ruined, for me, that part of the plot.These are the three major flaws that made this movie a disappointment to me, but for kids it still is a fun, quirky and inspiring movie!","

"Wonka","malmevik77","18 December 2023","WonkaThis film continues a pattern I've seen in films recently where the main character hides their own pain by producing things that make other people happy, insisting that it boosts their own happiness. This, as expected, is not true, as the underlying pain continues even after a goal is reached. With Wonka, he produces chocolates of varying exotic and magical degrees so that when he reaches a goal of perceived success, that his pain will lessen or end. I'm reading into this too much, but I couldn't help but picture what the movie would have been like if chocolate has been replaced by drug addiction. They certain portray chocolate as a drug, even using the word cartel to describe those who sell their product.What follows next is a wacky and musical journey where others join his cause in order to escape literal but ridiculous imprisonment. The motives of the others are touched on, but attention is mostly paid to Noodle, an orphan girl. There are inconsistenices in the storyline about the nature of perceived corruption in law enforcement and about the ease of sneaking out of a years long depiction of slavery after it is first deemed impossible.However, I still loved the movie enough to look past that due to the use of colors, songs, wild exuberance, an elegant giraffe, and a silly character played by Rowan Atkinson. In accordance with the chocolate equals drugs, even the members of the church become corrupt to continue receiving their ""fix"".Of course, the movie ends as expected, with Wonka building his famous factory, to continue producing a better form of addictive substances. Maybe my addictive personality found joy in this never ending cycle of taking or making more of something to lessen one's own pain. Even with Wonka letting go of his original motive for making chocolate, he continues to do so, to inspire happiness in a dreary existence.Yes I loved it and recommend it, but it didn't sit right after thinking too much. Face value: it's a sweet treat with happy endings.","

"Wonka","Cinema-reviewer321","13 February 2024","I like the first movie adaptation Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) with its good performances and songs, but the second movie adaptation Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) by Tim Burton was simply good enough with ok performances and a unique style from Tim Burton; so, I am interested on what you can do with a Willy Wonka prequel. The prequel movie Wonka (2023) was very enjoyable to watch with great performances, nice songs, over the top antagonists that fit the tone of the movie, and favorable effects; what made the movie nice to watch was Timothée Chalamet as the character Willy Wonka because of how likable he is throughout the movie, and that the actor pulled off some of the strange qualities of his personality.Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka does an excellent job portraying him as a likable and strange character that you like watching, and see him progress in the chocolate making business by making lots of unique kinds of chocolate and making the chocolate with lots of weird ingredients; he has quite a few emotional moments that are effective, and you want him to get through the many obstacles in his way to achieve his goal of becoming a famous chocolatier. Willy Wonka's friend he makes named Noodle played by Calah Lane, who is also particularly good in the movie, helps Willy Wonka with his goal because he helped her in bringing chocolate into her life and sort out the backstory with her parents; I liked the friendship between her and Willy Wonka, and thought they worked well together. Though not in the movie that much, Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa breaking in and stealing chocolate from where Willy Wonka is staying was funny to watch, and he had beneficial effects for the look of him and how he acted, along with an occasional song number from him.The antagonists being greedy chocolatiers that are part of the chocolate cartel were over the top in how they acted and treated Willy Wonka when makes chocolate that is too good making him a threat to their businesses, but was over the top enough to fit what the tone of the story, which was being lighthearted and whimsical; the other antagonist that is basically working for the greedy chocolatiers was the chief of police played by Keegan-Michael Key, the character had a sweet tooth for chocolate involving him gaining weight, which can be funny, along with Rowan Atkinson having a role in the movie. The songs in the movie are nice to listen to and were sung well; but also, there were a lot of nice-looking visuals of Wonka making the chocolate and the locations he goes to involving a zoo or the main square of the town he is selling his chocolate at.The prequel movie Wonka (2023) was very enjoyable to watch, with the lead character being likable to watch and the performances being well-done, I did not know what to expect with this movie; the movie had the whimsical lighthearted imagination of the original Willy Wonka & the chocolate Factory (1971) achieved with Gene Wilder. I think if you want a simple good musical and you like the original movie with Gene Wilder, then this movie will be likable enough for fans of the original, along with it just being an enjoyable time; it is not perfect, but the movie surprised me, and I got a delightful experience.","

"Wonka","Dickiebyrne","19 December 2023","I can't put my finger on it, the film just lacked something for me, the music didn't hit the toe tapping quality it maybe could have. The songs over time might enter my most listened tunes for 2024 but interestingly the only time my ears pricked up were when I heard the notes towards the end for pure imagination. The set design and atmosphere were well done but didn't quite hit the magical notes you'd expect for Wonka. Olivia Coleman and Tom Davis were enjoyable but Wonka's sidekicks were sadly mostly forgettable. I enjoyed Keegan's ever increasing waistline over the film's length as he continued to sell himself out but would have liked a bit more menace from the three chocolatiers to offer a bit more jeopardy to the good guys.Hugh Grant was enjoyable and could have been sprinkled in a bit more across the film. Chalamet performed the role admirably, I'm not sure you need to have the qualities of a Gene Kelly to act and sing on film to perform these sorts of roles so he coped well enough with what was required of him.All in all a perfectly good 2 hours revisiting a children's classic and a welcome change from watching a string of below par superhero films.","

The least i expected in Wonka was the musical being good and i actually really loved all the musical in Wonka and in fact the best thing in the movie, and the most i expected in Wonka was Chalamet portrayal is mostly gonna cringe me and guess what? He actually a good Wonka!, surprise me with this 2 hour of enjoyable magical adventure, a character adaptation from a lovable novel and character that surprisingly works, it's a very creative good imaginative story with good character development, good performances by all the cast, and fascinating production design, i grew up with the Johnny Depp version so Charlie And The Chocolate Factory always have a special place in my heart and always gonna be my favorite, just recently rewatch Gene Wilder version for the second time and overall it is still a good movie but at the end i already know about mostly everything in fact it wasn't even a complete story, Wonka however takes a whole new original story with a nod's here and there and i definitely felt more fresh watching Wonka than the Gene Wilder version and so i did like it a bit more, overall i can safely say that Paul King's Wonka did justice to the Willy Wonka character while it's not perfect, it's still a good, fun, and enjoyable imaginative adventure fills with great characters, performances, and musical, making it one of the most entertaining films of the year.","

He wasn't unusual, eccentric, or qwerty enough. The plot and story and songs all needed help too. There was no mesmerizing magic about this film. Felt like it was rushed together to create a mediocre product. The creators of this really needed to stew on things a bit longer. Sad, since they had the talent needed for a good product. The direction of the execution of the final product was just meh. After a few days I probably won't even be able to recall that I even saw this movie.","

He brought a unique and captivating energy to the role of Wonka, making it hard to take my eyes off the screen. His ability to embody the character and bring him to life was truly remarkable. Throughout the film, Timothee's charm shined through, captivating the audience and making us fall in love with the character of Wonka. His performance was a delightful blend of charisma, wit, and talent. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, thanks in large part to Timothee's incredible portrayal. I highly recommend watching Wonka for Timothee's exceptional performance alone.","

Only thing I can remember seeing him before was Dune and wasn't a big fan, but he won me over here.I went into this having seen not a single preview/trailer, so I fully expected this to be the same familiar story, retold. It was not, and I was pleasantly surprised. Loved that by itself, but I also really enjoyed the story they gave us. Character development is essential and many artists/creators lately forget about that. So this was a nice change of pace.","

"Wonka","marcslope","2 January 2024","Went to this kind of grudgingly, not being a fan of Timothee Chalamet and after seeing some so-so reviews. It was delightful! Still don't entirely get Chalamet, but he's game, sings at least as well as Gene Wilder, and dances a bit, quite capably. I didn't realize it was a brand-new story from Paul King, and it's quite a dexterous one, giving Wonka a credible origin story and allowing for plenty of sight gags, warmth, and satire.  Calah Lane is adorable, and there are fun turns from Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Colman, Rowan Atkinson, and, especially, Hugh Grant. It's visually sumptuous, especially in IMAX. The new songs, by somebody I never heard of, are just fine-OK, they have some lazy rhymes, but they tell the story, inform us about the characters, and generally do the heavy lifting musical scores used to do. It made me laugh out loud, and the ""secret message"" revealed at the end (but not here) is a charming, touching finishing touch. What a surprise this one was!","

"Wonka","erickajizzle","29 December 2023","I dont like looking at trailers and I should have before leaving the house. Once I was at the theaters, sitting in my seat, about 30 minutes in I was severely disappointed. It was so boring. I think I fell asleep a few times. The storyline did not take us on a full journey as the previous Willy Wonkas. If you're saying you can't compare, its hard not to. This story gives off the impression that if you have the imagination then anything can happen, but forgets to mention that it takes hard work to get to that point. It takes money not just imagination. The Wonka of 2023 was made for the new Generation. If you're a fan of Gen Wilder and Johnny Depp version then be prepared because you just may not like 2023 Wonka.","

"Wonka","janellefink-16596","28 January 2024","My husband and I took our 3 & 5 year old daughters to this movie and loved it. We went in with no expectations and maybe that is why we enjoyed it. I loved the original as a kid, hated the remake, and the little call backs in this show were perfect. I felt the Wonka character was so wholesome and it was very whimsical throughout the movie. The songs were so cute and fun, I prefer this because the original Wonka was a just a tad dark. After watching so many kids movies that are overstimulating and have the most boring plots this was a breath of fresh air. I don't understand the low reviews but if you're expecting it to be like the 70s version I guess you were always going to be disappointed, Roald Dahl hated the original Wonka movie, I never read the book but I feel like this movie is closer to Dahl's work than the others. I guess just go in with low expectations and watch it through the eyes of a kid then it will seem more magical... or don't and be grumpy.","

"Wonka","djrmc24","2 March 2024","Director Paul King does it again with crafting a magnificant film that the whole family can enjoy! Timothée Chalamet was a perfect casting choice for the title character Wonka. He is energetic, funny, charming, and can sing! I really enjoyed the beginning tale of the legendary Wonka and how he starts up his Chocolate factory. The story here is so fun and magical. I also really enjoyed the beautiful set pieces and the supporting cast. I really wonder why Warner Bros studios did not make more of an effort to market this film more as the musical that it is. My only minor complaint is the movie is a little on the longer side for a family film at almost 2 hours. I feel the movie could have flowed better at being at 1 hour and 45 minutes. Also the tale of the Oompa-Lompas was kind of half baked in this film. I wish we got to spend more time with them. Overall this was a fun movie for both adults and children. Timothée Chalamet once again shows why he is Hollywood's next biggest leading star as he can do it all. Wonka gets a very solid 8 stars out of 10.","

Titular Timothee Chalamet arrives in 'the city' with a dream, only to be suppressed by the likes of Tom Davis, Olivia Coleman, Keegan Michael-Key, Matt Lucas & Rowan Atkinson - but with help from Hugh Grant, Jim Carter, Natasha Rothwell & others, he and his chocolate making magic rises up.

"Wonka","daisukereds","22 January 2024","Truthfully, this was much better than I expected.Not because of the simplistic script, the known Hollywood-people in roles other lesser-known actors could have partaken in (like Keegan-Michael Key's role! Although the rest of Wonka's posse was a breath of fresh air), the tacked-on franchise that didn't really need a sequel and such. But because the pacing is good, there's an emotional core that works very well and has a good resolution, and because as a musical it delivers catchy and energetic songs that all properly match the tone of what is being conveyed! I do think it is a bit too Paddington-adjacent (but if you are good at something) and somewhat derivative and quite different to actual-Wonka expectations.. but more is always better than none, specially when it is as competent as it is.And so, now that the movie is on streaming, it's not hard to at least suggest it.","

"Wonka","tehannamonroe83","6 February 2024","I remember my boyfriend saying long before Wonka came out ""Wonka will tell the tale of whether Chalamet can really act. He was fine in Dune..."" he said. ""But he had very little acting to do. And he was fine in French Dispatch. But again, he had very little to do. No, I think we'll find out if he can act when he tries to play Wonka.""And well... He can't. Anyone on here saying he's amazing has to be in love with his looks because there is nothing to love about his acting. He was appallingly awful in a couple of scenes, even delivering a line's cadence WRONG. He's supposed to be asking a question in the line but he says it as a statement and it is very obvious. Like who does that!? And I was not the only person who noticed either. To the person who said he did a bad Jim Carrey impression, I had the exact same thought, and it was indeed terrible. He's no Gene Wilder and he's no Johnny Depp. But worse than that, he's just bad to an uncomfortable degree.And the rest of the movie isn't much better...The songs were lackluster, the story was underwhelming. Like many have said, Hugh Grant is the best part of the movie and he gets little screen time.I'll say one other thing.The main character from The Bear should have been Wonka because he actually looks just like Gene. Maybe he wouldn't have had Gene's charm, but he would have been a better choice simply for the fact that he can actually act and looks just like him.","

The costumes are great (I predict at least a nomination in that category). And as for the comedy, there were definitely some laugh out loud moments; especially when it came to the villains and Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa character. And the ancillary characters were still able to hold their own. Finally, and I write this understanding the gravity, Chalamet as Wonka rivals, and might even surpass, both Depp's and Wilder's versions... but, let's face it, every version was amazing in its own right.","

"Wonka","JoshuaMercott","23 January 2024","Taking the iconic chocolate-making genius Willy Wonka and giving him a modern coat, the 2023 ""Wonka"" movie did right by the character and his legacy.After Johnny Depp's take on him in the 2005 movie and the original 1971 masterpiece with Gene Wilder, it was surprising and satisfying to see Timothée Chalamet give a stellar performance that was quite in keeping with Willy Wonka. He was empathic, innocent, and eccentric, lending ""Wonka"" an inspired humanity, emphasising a person's tendency to dream.This story goes back to when Willy was a young lad seeking an opportunity to open his first shop in the big city. In this regard, he felt like the thousands of young people today dreaming of opening their own startups.Poor but talented, Wonka went on to impress the masses, including the corrupt capitalist chocolatiers who wanted him either out of their business territory or under their control.There was much worth appreciating about how well the team conveyed this message, especially making it easy for young minds to understand. They, after all, deserve to know just how many doors the world intentionally closes.Driven by passion and ambition, and armed with countless chocolate and candy recipes and ideas - of the metaphysical and magical nature - an aspiring Willy Wonka came alive on the screen yet again.All the musical numbers were delightful. I was a tad nervous they'd be corny or cringey, but they did right by the song-n-dance legacy this particular IP is renowned for. Some portions can even make some people cry.A wealth of characters further enriched 2023 ""Wonka"". Aside from all the skilled dancers and choreographers, special shout-out to Hugh Grant (as Oompa Loompa), Sally Hawkins (as Willy's mom), Calah Lane (as Noodle), Natasha Rothwell (as Piper Benz), Rakhee Thakrar (as Lottie Bell), Rich Fulcher (as Larry Chucklesworth), Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (as Officer Affable), and Jim Carter (as Abacus Crunch).The seven villains at the heart of this plot also did noteworthy work. They were caricatures, but interesting regardless. Paterson Joseph (as Slugworth), Matt Lucas (as Prodnose), Mathew Baynton (as Fickelgruber), Keegan-Michael Key (as the police chief), Rowan Atkinson (as Father Julius), Tom Davis (as Bleacher), and Olivia Colman (as Mrs. Scrubitt) were a treat to watch; pun intended.On a side-note, I personally did not feel Hugh Grant was a bad casting choice for the Oompa Loompa, who is as iconic a character as Wonka himself. If you've seen Grant's best movies, you'll realize that he's capable of doing outstanding work.As a British-styled Oompa Loompa, he brought something amusing and fresh to the role, in alignment with his distinguished vocal delivery. Show-business often taps into intricate illusions, so one does not necessarily have to be short-statured to play a person of short stature.The emotional message at the heart of ""Wonka"" was that a genius can come from anywhere and that everyone - no matter if they're rich or poor, man or woman, young or old - deserves a chance at showcasing their talents.Eye-candy visuals and chocolatey-smooth timing defined various scenes and sequences. ""Wonka"" thus contained a captivating gloss of wonder with musical flourishes and subtextual finishes.It was another amazing chapter in the remakes based on this epic character whose cunningly hidden symbolism is matched only by his quirky grace.","

"Wonka","wuzhiliao","22 December 2023","The movie was really dull. After watching it, I felt like I'd been forced to drink a weird mix of aspartame and cocoa butter, which left me feeling queasy. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a parent with kids or a fan of the actors.I didn't get how the main character, who can make magical chocolates, ended up getting trapped by the hotel owner. The plot proves he shouldn't have been trapped at all. The two guys running the hotel seemed pointless. The laundry room part was unnecessary, and Wonka's story with his mother was poorly done. The side stories of the other characters weren't great either; they felt like a forced match. The scene where the little girl and Wonka run on the street seemed pointless. It lacked any romantic or light-hearted feel, just looked like two idiots running around.To make matters worse, the songs weren't catchy, and the dances were really boring. I mean, it's supposed to be a musical, right?","

"Wonka","TomTalksFilms","19 December 2023","Out of all of Roald Dahls books, Charlie and the chocolate factory has to be the one that needed another big screen adaptation the least. After 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you may of been of the thinking like myself that this story has had enough big screen adaptations. That is however apparently not the case according to Warner Bros and here we have a third adaptation of that very same story, 2023's Wonka.Directed by Paddingtons Paul King and staring Timothee Chalamaladingdong as Willy himself. The story is prequel to the original 1971 film and follows Wonka as he tries to bring his chocolate to the masses. He is however not alone in this pursuit and the chocolate cartel that already reside in the centre of the city want Wonka gone. Firstly, I remember very little about the '71 film as it failed to have much of an impact on me as a child. I did however grow up with the 2005 film which whilst far from perfect I enjoy despite this perhaps being an unpopular opinion. Being that I'm now into my 20's I can't say I was that exited for another Willy Wonka film however I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised.The thing that perhaps surprised me the most was that the film commits to being a musical. Whilst the other two films certainly have songs, I wouldn't say they were musicals per se however this one certainly is. I didn't feel the trailer made that clear but perhaps that was intentional as musicals of late do tend to do poorly at the box office. The songs themselves whilst not anything I'm going to be listening to over and over again were enjoyable and worked well with the films premise. A premise based on a man who is selling more than chocolate he's selling dreams and doing so against a cartel who are simply selling chocolate at extortionate prices (Cadbury I'm looking at you) to make their wallets fatter. The music only added to the magic and the sense of wonderment that the film provides. Every character in this film is very cartoonish and the films target audience is clearly younger children however I think adults will still find things to enjoy here too. I did at times think the main villains the chocolate cartel were a bit overly silly to the point where they are no longer menacing however this didn't impact my enjoyment of the film overall.Compared to the 2005 film it's a very positive take with an optimistic Wonka who has nothing but the upmost trust in people which could at times be mistaken for naivety. Generally I'm not a happy go lucky person and I do still prefer the bleakness of the 2005 film however I can't deny I left this film with a beaming smile and despite it not being directly a Christmas film it does have a Christmassy feel to it.",NA
"Wonka","Vic_max","16 December 2023","This movie had a number of beautiful callouts to the original movie with Gene Wilder - like the wondrous melodic tunes and the colorful ""land of chocolate"" imagery. I absolutely LOVED those things about this movie.However - the movie portrays Willy Wonka as some kind of wizard, capable of doing actual magic ... not magician-type tricks, but actual conjuring of virtually any kind of physical objects or landscapes .... albeit chocolate related. This is what confused the heck out of me.He's not supposed to have magical powers. He's supposed to be an eccentric, highly imaginative, and innovative chocolatier..Neither the book nor the two previous movies with Wilder and Depp portray Wonka this way. Even in this movie, he's just supposed to be a magician ... but then does continuous magical conjuring throughout the movie.I know ... the movie is a fictional fantasy and there's a lot of creative license allowed - esp. In kids movies. But I've never seen it this grossly overstated. If they wanted to go in this direction, fine - make clear at the beginning that he's a magical being.Anyway - I did emotionally enjoy the striking visuals, the references to the music of the original, Wonka's determined optimist attitude ... and, of course, every scene with Hugh Grant. However my brain rejected the storyline for the reason I mentioned.If you're fan of the books or.any of the previous movies - you're going to feel the need to check this out. Hopefully, you'll be more open to the storyline.",NA
