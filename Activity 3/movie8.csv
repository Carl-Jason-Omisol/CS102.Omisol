"Avatar: The Way of Water","Rob-O-Cop","20 April 2023","I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","fraser-simons","29 December 2022","Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","dommercaldi","29 January 2023","Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Tweetienator","16 December 2022","The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","JumpingCineFile","15 December 2022","This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Paragon240","16 December 2022","It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","garabedian123","18 December 2022","So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","alfredvankuik","15 December 2022","James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","murkee","17 February 2023","Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film.","

This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.","

Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Surreptitious_Vin","15 May 2023","Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora. Had it been on Discovery or Nat Geo, itd have been awesome. But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","fthkgdcc","17 March 2023","Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Sam56800","16 December 2022","I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.","

The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","namob-43673","16 December 2022","If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Jeremy_Urquhart","14 December 2022","It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","mmarab91","10 June 2023","Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","chopchop_","26 December 2022","I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.","

Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","hoernkeem","4 February 2023","'Avatar: The Way of Water' is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 'Avatar', also directed by James Cameron. If this teaches us anything it is that more than likely you shouldn't bet against James Cameron as his high profile sequel soared to $1 billion dollars worldwide in only 14 days and, when all is said and done, will probably be one of only a handful of films to make over $2 billion. Despite a 13 year hiatus all of the principle actors return to reprise their roles including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. The film is a technical marvel and much of the delay was due to the need to actually develop the appropriate technology to allow filming Cameron's meticulous vision. At least one more Avatar film will be produced with the potential for more if they keep being successful.It is 12 years after the events of the first film and Jake Sully is the chief of his clan and lives with his wife Neytiri and their 3 children plus the adopted daughter of Grace's comatose avatar who's conception is a mystery. The daughter, Kiri, is also played by Sigourney Weaver who played Grace in the previous film. Another constant presence is a human boy called Spider who is a child of the deceased Miles Quaritch. The kid was too young to be put in cryostasis at the time most of the humans were expelled, and thus was allowed to stay growing up wild and much more Na'vi than human. Spider is, of course, practically inseparable from Sully's kids so you can see the potential for drama here. The ""Sky People"" as they are called have returned with the aim now being to colonize rather than plunder as the Earth is dying. The Sky People once again return with avatars of their own but this time instead of transferring a live human's consciousness into the avatar they were able to upload the thoughts and memories of deceased soldiers including the major antagonist from the first film Quaritch who serves as this avatar contingent's leader. On a raid Quaritch's avatars manage to capture Jake's kids including Spider. All of the kids are liberated except Spider who ends up begrudgingly aiding Quaritch. There is some sort of father son bonding that does occur, however, Spider remains predominantly loyal to his adopted Na'vi family. Jake Sully decides the best thing for the tribe is for him to take his family and flee. They eventually land with the reef people and need to learn the way of water to live there and be of use. There are growing pains for the family as they attempt to learn the ways of the new tribe. The children especially struggle as they don't fit in with the other kids. Of course Quaritch does not just let Sully and his family run and eventually tracks them to the reef people and begins a shock and awe campaign of violence to flush them out. The kids get captured again, and eventually a big showdown occurs, and of course with Cameron it is a spectacle of a showdown and while the side of right prevails, as one would expect, they do clearly leave room for the story to continue on.Cameron has clearly created a sumptuous visual feast with motion capture technology at the most cutting edge that it has every been, and I don't want to undersell the special effects as those special effects are why people are tuning in. It is why people are spending top dollar on premium seats at the best screens they can find because, story aside, this film demands to be seen in that format. Much like the first film 'The Way of Water' feels like all of the creative effort was put into the technical aspect of the film and the story is, for the most part, basic. In fact there are many very similar themes to the first story. As Jake initially needed to gain the trust of the forest people and bond with their mounts the family goes through the exact same trials when they get to the reef people. This film actually may take a step backwards with the plot due to some gaping plot holes that they just plow through with all their fancy effects hoping nobody is paying too close attention to things like the narrative. It is an incredibly bizarre shift that in the first film the human invaders were looking for the universe's most expensive mineral, and only 12 years later the Earth is dying so now finding a new home is the mission du jour. Somewhere in there they just managed to uncover a completely different substance that everybody is after, and there is no mention of the unobtanium that drove the entire plot of the first film. The other huge flaw is the main driver for this film which is Quaritch's pursuit of Jake Sully which seems very much like a vendetta from his past life although it is not framed that way. The story only casually mentions why so many resources are being exhausted to hunt down this former chieftain. The script does not make it clear whether or not the Sky People seek to inhabit Pandora along with the Na'vi or if the are seeking to destroy them or pacify them. I think ultimately the aim, for now, is pacification and they believe getting Jake Sully will somehow accomplish that although once his family goes into exile that makes zero sense. It is super frustrating to see such an impressive display and see the narrative squandered. I will give James Cameron all the credit in the world as he has made a movie that everyone believes needs to be seen in theaters on the big screen, and I agree with that sentiment. Due to the visual effects alone this is a special film, however, these films of his are never going to be great until he can really develop the narrative beyond these basic confines he has lain out while also making the story actually make sense with in the larger framework of the film. As with the first movie 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is a beautiful yet flawed ideal.Eric's Grade: B-","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Dory_Darko","14 December 2022","He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","oogway22-428-714530","16 December 2022","One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","cornelia123","19 December 2022","Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jaysonpajaronvistal","15 December 2022","I decided to rewatch the first Avatar last night before watching Avatar 2 and I am always in awe of how stunning the visuals are; it was a crowd-pleaser and more agreeable for the general audience. However, with the first Avatar, the story was basic and simple---it was rather forgettable. The thing is, the Avatar franchise has a simple story but it was told grandly. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' was a captivating visual feast, with every attempt beautifully framed via painstakingly flawless CGI, but the message about protecting your loved ones is not new to us, but it was ingenious. James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on earth he has done that. It is the simple plot accompanied by such technical achievement that has always been the formula for almost all of Cameron's movies, not just Avatar. Simplicity is not a bad thing.Just like in the first Avatar, characters are established a lot, and there is not much emotional attachment during the first half. However, the thrill and excitement peaked during the second act were worth it---This is the trick for most highly-budget films, they will entice you with visual and technical achievement, but the story is not that grand nor special for the audience to keep talking about it in the next 5 years. The Pandora world Cameron takes us to is excellent and magnificently conceptualized, but the story is missing the emotional draw that made this film a pretentious masterpiece. Though the visuals are still magnificent, it's difficult this time not to recognize the repetition of the story and the limited character arcs the movie presented. You will remember Avatar---aside from blue people---as a movie with impeccable and out-of-this-world visuals, but the story remains forgettable.Some films are just pure escapism and sometimes that's what audiences need, and this is what Avatar 2 delivered. Avatar 2 doesn't necessarily check all those boxes to become a great film, but what it does right will offer viewers moments of astonishment, full-body immersion, and beauty. You can easily watch the movie and points out its mistakes and flaws, but it is hard to resist the fun and adventure the film delivers throughout its 192 minutes runtime. It is clear that James Cameron is making this movie for a general audience, and while imperfect, it certainly seems to serve its purpose.","

Where's the story? What's the plot? What's the point of the movie? I knew it was gonna be so disappointing after the first 15 minutes - the scenes are cut so bizarrely that some scenes drag on and on, while others feel like ure watching a commercial for 2 drastically different products. There is no soul, u just dont care about any of the characters, u don't care about the animals (why was he so lazy to just copy paste 95% of the wildlife??) The first Avatar was liked by everyone, no matter on what level u were at as a person - the basic u got the marvel of the avatar world, the deeper meaning too was there, so what's here? U couldn't care less about any of the characters, and some scenes are just funny with the hissing like animals, it was just comical. It felt like a 3 hour commercial for kind kind of sea world. The script was terrible and the only time Jake said to his son "" i see you"" had no weight at all. I went with my dad thinking it was gonna be at least 60% as good as the first one, I left pissed off actually 1.because it was so long 2.at least if u make a 3 hr movie, dont let teens write the script!!

I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","OJT","14 December 2022","James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","AdrenalinDragon","16 December 2022","James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","brentsbulletinboard","18 December 2022","As the long-awaited sequel to director James Cameron's 2009 megahit sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" has been one of 2022's most anticipated releases. And, for the most part, it's a visually stunning and modestly entertaining piece of cinema. But is it the masterpiece everyone has been anxiously waiting for? Hardly. While the film is long on style (it truly is gorgeous to look at), it comes up short on substance. The script is the main problem here, telling a tale that's not overly engaging or insightful (certainly much less so than its more compelling predecessor) and full of story threads that either regurgitate material from the original or borrow from a variety of other sources, both narratively and visually. Then there's the runtime, coming in at a whopping 3:13:00, far, far longer than it needs to be, especially in the overly protracted closing hour. The action sequences become a bit tiresome and gratuitous after a while, and other segments feel like a polished travelogue for the Pandora Chamber of Commerce. What's more, there are storylines left unresolved, making this a picture that can't fully live up to being a standalone entity (one of my moviemaking pet peeves). To its credit, though, the picture's pacing is surprisingly tolerable for a film of this length, and it makes excellent use of its 3D technology (perhaps better than any other movie in which I've seen it employed in recent years). Still, for an offering that's been 13 years in the making, I expected something a little fresher and more inventive than this. But, for those who can't get enough of this franchise, this installment should satisfy nicely. And, if not, fans can look forward to three more sequels scheduled to be released over the next six years (though I'm not sure how many of them I'll be seeing).","

I guess I was expecting so much more waiting so long and having to sit in the theater for so long too. I did cry a little, so I gave it 6 stars, but Finding Nemo was more interesting. The story was weak and cookie cutter I've seen that before kinda thing. Why couldnt we have more animal fighting? I loved that in the first one.

That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.","

This movie is beyond tedious and the pretty visuals only distract you for so long.The runtime is beyond 3 hours, and it is readily apparent throughout the movie. Everything is dragged out except for the story, which is a distant second on the priority list behind visual effects. Our power couple has a bunch of kids who never do what they're told, ever. Angry soldier man is back in an avatar because Cameron couldn't think of a different antagonist, so he implanted soldier guys memories into an avatar to keep him alive. Humans returned to Pandora to kill Jake and extract goo from whales. I'm sure the goo had a name but I don't recall what it was, hopefully it was more thought inducing than..... Unobtainium. Sigh.This movie was to the original avatar, what ""the force awakens"" was to ""a new hope"". Same story, new names.The children were mediocre characters that were more annoying than necessary. The new tribe were a slightly greener color, otherwise they were the same as the tree tribes. Some new animals that were virtually the same as the last one, just water based.RatingsSpecial effects - 9 (3d in the Imax version was pretty meh, but the movie is very visually attractive).Story&characters - 1 (both give mediocre a bad name)

Ending - 1 (There isn't one, this feels like an episode, not a movie)Overall - 4/10. 1 star removed due to the runtime which shouldn't have cracked 1.5 hours but is more than double the length, mostly to add more special effects to distract you from the lack of story/plot = 3/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jclenz","3 January 2023","More artificial worlds are waiting for the masses. I still can not understand the hype. There is nothing special about both Avatar movies. They just look like a videogame or PIXAR movie. They are so successful because they are so simpel, that really everyone can follow the plot. Switch your brain off and forget everything else. It is just escapism. Some people would watch this 24/7, just to forget the world and themselves. James Cameron is the master of distraction. This is entertainment for the brainwashed masses. Their brains really need this silly movie. And of course it is also about the money, lots of money.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","adrenilinmatt-56062","3 January 2023","Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.","

Part 3 looks to be more of the same this will not be anywhere near as successful as the 1st film and it took him 13 years WHY?? It had some brilliant scenes no doubt but after the huge success of the 1st film he should have pulled his HUGE EGO head out of his ass and made the sequel with 2 -3 years TOPS lord of the rings BLOWS this trilogy away already and it didnt take 13 years for part 2. I believe his perfection or OCD or whatever is so way beyond where it needs to be its creating a limited amount of product and with only 100 percent of his visions. He needs to move on from avatar and do it quickly I can tell you this part 3 will bomb!! It wont do 100 million domestically. On a final note him giving the middle finger to fans that boied cause he left without acknowledging them or giving autographs shows what a pompous jerk he us if it wasnt for THOSE fans you wouldn't have the life you have and YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT THAT PREMIER!!

'Unobtanium', really? What an uninspired name for a resource which is difficult to mine.Anyhow, moving on to this film, I just don't get the whole story...
If your tribe are in danger by a known enemy, why on earth would you go and put another tribe in danger by hiding out with them? What a selfish, self-important, arrogant thing to do! It was obvious from the start that eventually they would put that tribe in danger too, but they didn't seem to give a monkeys!Where on earth did the two sprogs come from? There was absolutely no mention of any of these types of relationships happening in the first film for either Grace or the Colonel . To suddenly have two kids pretty much being the main characters in this film just defies sense or logic, and shows a complete lack of respect for the audience! For anyone justifying these characters by some sort of hidden back story from the first film is just using lazy excuses!What?? The Colonel is alive and in a avatar body? Again, lazy writing to bring back the antagonist!I was excited to see this sequel, but feel very let down by a lazy, boring and dull story, trying to ride on the ""Look at the graphics"" selling point. You did that 14 years ago... this time you need a good story!I won't be going to the cinema to see the third instalment in 2024, I'll wait for it to come out on a streaming service! Shame!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Xstal","16 December 2022","There's a moon that's called Pandora far away, its unique flora and its fauna hold the sway, keeping everything aligned, a rooted network gives a spine, but vengeful enemies return, to have their day. The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and peaceful and they're free, with Jake Sully as their chief, they have the power and belief, to force adversaries away and make them flee. But these invaders play their cards as Avatars, it gives them strength to match the locals and it jars, so Jake moves his family, away to islands out at sea, taking to the air, while traveling afar.101 years before Avatar The Way of Water was created, Charles Chaplin released what must have been to cinema goers at the time a work of amazement with 'The Kid', to this day one of the greatest pieces of film projected on a big screen. Comparing these two films is impossible, the advances in technology and the way images are presented today is mind-blowing. I left the cinema excited but a little sad, that I won't be around to see or experience what magic film lovers might absorb, and how they might absorb it in the year 2122, but I did feel overwhelmed at the incredible effects, the imagination, and innovations used to present an analogous story to ones lived out on a planet whose environment's not too dissimilar to Pandora. While the themes it transmits are by no means original or new in their translation, the way they are presented, over three hours that flies by, is truly awe inspiring and almost beyond belief.See it on the biggest screen you can, in 3D, and savour every moment of it.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Serva","14 December 2022","The first one did not by any means have an original story, but at least it had a story! The story in Avatar 2 is all but nonexistent, this feels more like a three hour benchmark video for the latest graphics card.Jake and Neytiri are more or less supporting characters, the focus is on their children. The movie really shoves the nuclear family agenda down your throat. One wonders if James Cameron has spent too much time in Pandora to realize that the world has changed, and a family doesn't have to be a nuclear family, if one even decides to start a family in the first place.Jake keeps repeating the gagworthy line ""A father protects his family. That's what gives him purpose."" Only problem is that throughout the movie he FAILS to protect his children over and over again. Because despite the vomit-inducing family theme, their dumb children break the rules repeatedly. Here would be nice place to have some character development that Avatar 2 sorely lacks. When one of the brats breaks the rules for the umpteenth time in a row, they could come to a conclusion: ""Maybe I should actually listen to what my parents say?"" They problem then would be that this is the only way that the movie progresses the plot. A child does a stupid thing -> We get ""drama"".I saw the movie in HFR, and it boggles the mind why the framerate is so inconsistent? It is very noticeable and takes you out of the action.The characters have no depth, a big problem when it comes to Jake's identical two sons. They are impossible to tell apart. 14-year old Sigourney Weaver has almost no purpose except the ending, same with Spider.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","subxerogravity","19 December 2022","Not to say I did not like the first one cause I did, but it was not the best movie I ever scene, and this sequel is better than that.The story is actually not as tight as the original tale, but it's a better story. It just flows slower than the original. There will be a point for all of us where the story slows down enough to make you realize you have to go to the bathroom and that's how much you actually love the film. For me I think that was 12 or 15 minutes before the end credits rolled. That's pretty good.As a sequel we got a more Indepth look at the characters from the last movie, which included some surprising comebacks, and of course we got some new characters as this story is no longer about Jake Skully's adventure, but the adventure of the family he made snice we last saw him.What I found interesting is that the hole hoopla of the film is that its filmmaker James Cameron had to wait the 12 to 13 years for the technology capable to make this film. You could say the sign of a good director was that I could not tell what that technology was capable of, but I have to say, visually, that first film was far more outstanding than what I saw here.I did love the introduction of some new characters that brought us the new culture of the sea people, but in comparison to the original I was expecting a lot more underwater spectacular, I was expecting to see dozens of alien marine life, but Camren chose to concentrate this marine life to one creature which was not a bad idea cause it led so greatly to a well-formed story.I'll admit this adventure had a few loopholes that I think were done on purpose because we know the franchise is growing, but this second Avitar movie, not surprisingly worth that IMAX 3D ticket price in every way possible.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","HalBanksy","24 December 2022","So Avatar 2 needed to entertain audiences of all ages for over 3 hours. Introduce a huge group of new characters and balance a dozen plot threads. Once again revolutionise CGI & 3D technology. All while providing a satisfying sequel to the highest grossing film of all time, after 13 years. This should be impossible.. Well James Cameron is no normal director.I read reviews that say the plot is a ""repeat of the original."" What movie did you watch? Let's see.. The antagonist resurrected in the body of the species he was trying to eradicate - crushing his own skeletal corpse. A human child marooned on a planet where he literally cannot breath the air - being raised by aliens, now meeting his father from beyond the grave. A teenage girl with supernatural powers - the product of a messiah virgin birth, who is possibly the reincarnation of a goddess. An outcast boy dealing with sibling rivalry and failing paternal expectations - who forms an emotional bond with a genius space-whale who shows visions of the past by swallowing him whole. Parents facing the trauma of losing a child, and survivor guilt. Commentary on accepting refugees and destructive human impact on the environment. And it also happens to be one of the most beautiful blockbusters ever made. Overall, I would say a pretty remarkable success. Looking forward to part 3 already.","

It's a bloated, overhyped, and derivative mess that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The plot is as thin as the CGI is thick, and the characters are about as deep as a kiddie pool. The dialogue is cheesy and cringeworthy, and the acting is about as convincing as a politician's campaign promises. The special effects are about as groundbreaking as a flip phone, and the 3D is nothing more than a cheap gimmick to hike up ticket prices.

There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise.","

The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save the film from its lack of substance.The movie tries to replicate the success of the first one but fails in adding anything new to the story. It is a rehash of the first movie with the same characters and themes. There are no new ideas.

This time it is set in water, as the title suggests. Those who have seen part 1 don't necessarily have to watch this again, it's almost the same film only with children. Things like this rarely go well, we remember The Mummy ( from 1999). I'm not really looking forward to part 3 at all, because part 2 set the bar so low. It's an underwater documentary with a few explosions and the usual drama-inducing scenes as the standard Hollywood film script dictates. If you haven't succumbed to the schmaltzy-looking CGI adventure after 1h, you might want to pop back in Terminator 2, a much better action film and even with a plot that really moves forward based on Part1.","

I saw the first a million times in 3D at home obviously my favourite 3D movie of all time. This one surely is not. So they make kids they have a family, there is weirdness in the family which is wonderful and it doesn't have to be really explained because honeys as much as you would like this was never a hardcore science fiction movie just light fantasy with elements of tech blah blah. But they wasted 13 years on their beautiful planet and prepared nothing for defense? That's an offence! They didn't talk to Eywa for a solution? Oh wait young Sigourney, Kiri is the new Messiah that will be revealed in episode 5. Introduce vomit emoji here. The story is exactly the same EXACTLY!!!! With more clichés from the first.

They gotta promote it, right?Truth is, this is like the first (literally!) but on Alzheimer... or on drugs... Nothing makes sense, nothing matters anymore, like it did so much in the first one... the dialogues are excruciatingly poor, the scenes follow each other without any flow, just thrown there randomly... What happened to you dear James? Did you microdose with something? What the heck, man?!...The first movie was a literal book about how-to-make-a-grand-piece-of-art! Everything mattered, each line of dialogue, each vehicle, each ship, each animal, each character was well-defined, well-played and well-written. Here, aside from copying lines and gestures and even grunts of old characters, none of them matters anymore, there are no real emotions, no spirituality (except for some fake watered-down attempt)... just some good special effects, especially the underwater ones. Scenes don't flow harnoniously anymore, like they did in the first one, they're just thrown there one after another senselessly... like a bad soup or a bland dish made by a bored or angry cook (who got lazy after being given some Michelin stars).But these alone do not make a good movie.The music is inexistent, some rehash of old tunes from the first movie. Nothing carries the scenes, musically.The HFR does this movie even less of a service, since now it feels you're watching a reality show with Navi people, or a poor Navi-tional Geographic documentary...All in all...

What once was a a true science fiction gold standard, with an emphasis on science that has depicted a struggle between a military industrial complex and a human condition, became a contrived military movie painted in blue. Every bit of this is a vomit inducing unless you are a square jarhead. Acting was atrocious.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","slateofmind","3 February 2023","First off, I'm a HUGE fan of James Cameron, and not just his biggest hits, I also recognize The Abyss as a brilliant film. So I was obviously waiting impatiently for over 10 years to see this. The first Avatar was a visual feast with a story that served it well enough to draw us in and make us care once the action (and deeply subversive message) of the third act hit. Now that we're already familiar with Pandora and the characters, I was hoping this one would build upon that story, while also introducing a new villain, raising the stakes, and pushing the subversive message further, but no... that's not what happens. (I won't spoil it, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm referring to here.) This just felt like a lazy script that was thrown together quickly so they could spend the majority of their time on the visual FX, which don't get me wrong, are absolutely jaw-dropping. I gave the film 5/10 almost entirely for that reason.It's worth seeing in the theaters for the visual experience alone, but I'm disappointed because I expected so much more from a master like James Cameron. I was so bored and had such little investment in the characters by the third act that I actually found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be heartfelt. (""Noooo! She was my soul sister!"")If I wanted a CGI theme park ride with a lazy story, I'd go watch a Marvel movie. You can do better than this, James. I mean, come on, you have to put more in than ""Ok... same basic plot as the first one, but now we're underwater..."" And the dialogue of the teenagers... I get that their father is originally from Earth, but they are growing up in a village on another planet full of those who aren't. They're not going to go around saying ""bro"" every other word. That's just lazy, sloppy writing. I'm really hoping he puts more into the script of the next one, if he really does plan on making more of these.","

I was a big fan of the first movie and loved that visually stunning material was shared with an excellent script that had many parallels. The new edition was a pale shadow of the original. I was underwhelmed by the visuals but that could be because I was watching this in a regular theater and not 3D. I was most disappointed by lack of story (soul) of this movie. Editing was rather poor too with scenes being excessively long. Old characters were stale and new characters were not developed at all. Didn't really form bond with any new characters. It looked like producer and directors were thinking of something else while they made this movie. I understand that there might be more sequels but this edition in itself is not worth the time and the money.","

That's why it's getting 1 star.I wasn't expecting anything from the story seeing as the story in the first movie was average but fun to watch. So I went in blind. It really felt like a next-gen video game and if it were a game I would've liked it more - I think. But for me it was just awful.Let me put it this way, if you are able to ignore the macho sexism and every tired trope, then you'll probably have fun. I couldn't. It was too much, too cliché, too cheesy, too stupid.Regarding the tired tropes, we have for example,the ""sweet little daughter who gets caught every time""""the weird ""freak"" who is strangely attuned to the nature and gets to show it off at the end""""the outcast who befriends another outcast and both get to redeem themselves""""the bullies picking on the new kids but hey, new kid saves them, so they're besties now""""The distant, stern father who is too tough to show his love for his kids in a healthy way""and so ond, and so forth. But the thing is, I didn't care for any of the characters because it simply felt empty. I didn't root for anyone and what the hell was up with their marriage?? No chemistry, no love?It also felt like the qriters didn't know what message they wanted to send, should it be a movie against whaling? Against genocide of indigenous people? About friendship? Nobody knows.And lastly, do the women actually have any dialogue except for grunting, screaming and looking like psychopaths? Honestly, it felt like they had maybe like 5 sentences or something.

Also discovering the world during the first half of the film and trying to amaze the audience with beauty of the visuals was waaaay too long during the first half of the film, then the second half of it the action started and it didn't disappoint. Don't miss the movie at the theater.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","MajBlade2","8 June 2023","I said when the first Avatar came out, its's Dancing with Blue Wolves. This go ahead is just awful. I love how Jake Skully, not to the other Navi, but in his narration call the humans Sky People. He is a sky people, it just sounds like forced going native. Its like every other story of its kind. Just better CGI. But the movie had all the right characters and formula you could love the CGI and give a pass to a story you have heard before When the movie started I got slapped with a cliche in the first 5 minutes and then it just went up from their . I swear most of the movie I thought I somehow had passed out for 5 minutes several times and I was missing parts of the story. Again these are things you start noticing when the story isnt moving and the CGI is not as good as last time. I mean how did they do it? Do worse with everything? Oh, and now there not strip mining, there killing sentient Whales. When I realized what they were doing I fell out of my chair laughing. Humans are just the absolute worse. Literally brain drilling with giant drills. All the people attached to this film You know your sky people too?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","winterfishes","14 December 2022","I loved how beautiful it was. The CGI and cinematography is a work of art. Also, I saw it in the cinema which everyone should absolutely do! But the plot was such a snooze fest. Just insert any classic sequel plot - here's your hero, they've grown up, have a family, and there are some bad guys, the heroes are threatened, they have to fight back yada yada. I mentally clocked out a couple times only snap back into it and realise nothing had happened. At least the Aussie guy was entertaining.Also it is looooong. So maybe that didn't help things. I can imagine watching this at home with an interval in between and enjoying it more.Go see it for the visuals. Just don't prepare to use your brain understanding the story.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","mark.waltz","19 August 2023","Yes, the visuals are fantastic; Breathtaking as a matter of fact. But that story is moving through so many directions and subplots that it becomes irritating, tedious, pretentious and so convinced of its greatness that it becomes everything but great. The story pops between worlds in a very confusing manner, and at times feels like several ""Avatar"" movies meshed together as a messy, flavourless stew.What stood out early to me outside the visuals was the revelation that villains of the first film were reincarnated as Na'vi, with the same memories as their human lives, and unrepentant even though they know that they were evil and being punished for that. It's now about destroying their new identity's culture, especially the one time human (Sam Worthington) who now lives as the Na'vi chief and is intent on protecting his tribe.So as they become an underwater tribe (living above water in a strong plant formed structure), they face all kinds of dangers, including monstrous sea creatures. One of the tribe is attacked by a relentless creature who ends up being destroyed by an even bigger one who turns out to be friendly. The young na'vi speak too much like human teenagers from the hood which is eye rolling and laughable.I had hoped for more of Sigourney Weaver whose human and avatar characters in the first movie were shear perfection of a completely beautiful disposition and temperament, but I could count her scenes on one hand during the first two (of three) hours. She's still saint like and invaluable to the story. Edie Falco is very funny as a very serious and ruthless general. Kate Winslet is completely unrecognizable, and it makes me wonder how much of the actor's participation is computer generated and later dubbed in with their voices. Sad to say though that the 13 year hiatus between the films didn't result in it aging nicely and certain feelings about its agenda made me further agitated and in no hurry for more.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","masonsaul","17 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water is a phenomenal sequel that wisely chooses not surpass the original in scale and instead offers a more intimate tale focusing on revenge and the struggle to be a good father whilst still delivering some truly awe inspiring set pieces and advancing filmmaking technology like never before.Also, as it is well documented that it's supposed to be part 2 of a multiple film saga it's so damn refreshing that the film feels so self contained. It barely sequel baits, focusing exclusively on this story and has surprisingly genuine stakes as no one truly feels safe or guaranteed to make it out alive.Sam Worthington gives a better performance as Jake Sully this time around, with his character showing more maturity and a stoic nature. Zoe Saldana doesn't get as much to do this time around but still has her fair share of emotionally powerful moments.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was one the best parts of the original and here he somehow manages to be even better, bringing more of the expected ruthlessness and tough exterior as well as showing a more human side to the character that's unexpected but really works.All of the new, younger actors are superb. They carry their scenes really easily and fit in naturally so it doesn't bother when the film focuses on them opposed to the adults. The best performance is Jack Champion as Spider whose a joy to watch and is particularly impressive as the only practical element in a lot of his scenes.James Cameron's direction is incredible, the CGI is insanely detailed and real, improving vastly on a predecessor that honestly still holds up. He also once again proves that he's one of few filmmakers to actually understand 3-D and uses it to its fullest. He even makes the higher frame rate good for the most part which is extremely impressive.The 3 hour 12 minute run time definitely sounds imposing but surprisingly flies by thanks to excellent pacing, keeping the film constantly moving without feeling rushed and is a testament to how a film's pacing matters way more than it's actual length.The music by Simon Franglen is really good, it's not an easy task to follow in the footsteps of the late great James Horner and even if most of the score is just the old themes recycled it only proves how well they work at evoking the necessary emotions for their corresponding scenes.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","80sHorror","16 December 2022","Cameron minions will act as if they just watched the second coming of Jesus but this movie, just like its predecessor, is nothing more than smoke. If filmmaking is all about wide shots and technological achievement then yes it is the greatest movie of all time. Unfortunately, some people enjoy deeper movies, with strong narratives, great performances, deep themes. Avatar 2 offers none of that. James Cameron has once again achieved something unparalleled: another 3h+ movie with absolutely nothing of substance. Nothing. It's the same terrible outcome the first one offered wrapped in the most beautiful package. It's enough for some but I'd like to think those with a little more intellectual curiosity will see right through the joke this movie is: Dances with Wolves in Outer Space Part II, Dumber Edition.","

Have we watched the same movie with the blue and green monkeys?This movie is a whole repeat of the first, nothing added. What was great is the first film? Not much but the few interesting aspects were strong. Pandora was something unseen before really coming out of a dream. The principle of avatars was also an interesting idea and well developed. Those two ingredients really made it an original addition to hollywood blockbusters. What is original in this second film? Nothing. More avatars, more pandora. Storyline is flat, and acting is poor. But of course picture and CGI are beautiful. But are CGIs really justify an additional movie? I dont think so. Sometimes it feels too much plastic texture and computer water. I still put a few starts because I respect the hard work of the team but this is definitely the worst movie of cameron.","

While some may have completely forgotten or just lost interest in another film after waiting years and years, this film truly does deliver nearly the same ambience and excitement. At times there are some aspects that become a little more predictable and cliché but the visual prowess is just too magnificent to deny and once again the driving force in this spectacle. Cameron creates settings that are phenomenally breathtaking while bringing the heart pounding action. The emotional parts are still prevalent and help with the overall product. The voice acting and motion capture is once again terrific. Powerful symphonies ensue in the score. Overall this is a fantastic sequel though can meander slightly. Let's just hope the next sequel comes before another 13 years ...","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","severajaaho","23 January 2023","James Cameron's technical spectical got me going to the theater for a second time since 2009 and it was a mistake. Even though the film looks impressive at times, at some point I started to realize that I would rather watch a proper nature documentary. The action scenes are well made in a way where the veteran director seems to take all of his greatest hits compilation. 3 hours of video game footage however does not apparently make for a good or even a decent film.The technical spectical is not enough to save this film from awful writing a script that it has. I wasn't expecting Shakespearean drama, but the story and the characters were even more bland and/or non-existent than in the first film. All of the characters have one single motive and none of them are relatable or even likable. The story itself is an excuse for the mass violent spectacle happening on the screen. Even though the Na'vi are fighting the American imperialists, they seem to have adopted all of their core values: patriarchy, nuclear family, violence as a virtue, chastity of body and having a gun fetish. Their supposed connectness with nature seems more like one what middle class people from the western world experience while on a holiday in a tropical island, than what actual indigenous people have.James Cameron, you can trick me twice but I will not make the same mistake three times and will happily skip the rest of Avatar films.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","brendonstrevig","28 December 2022","I think we all need to accept that James Cameron is not a good director. He likes aliens, water, sinking ships, and expensive movies. The guy doesn't have much range.I don't like the first. My wife somehow loves it. I only went to see this because she wanted to, but multiple times during the movie I wanted to walk out or shout ""are you serious?""I have a lot of issues with this.1) They say bro so many times. It's annoying.2) Sigourney Weaver is great, but voicing a kid is weird.3) Jake Sully likes to make these profound statements that are completely ironic. ""Sully's stick together"" yet the family constantly gets separated or the siblings watching each other don't. ""Father's protect"" yet he's leaves his best chance at protecting his kids behind. He leaves an army he LEADS that defeated and killed the villain already.4) Death clearly doesn't matter because the bad guy is back. Sigourney Weavers character is basically back too. Do they just plan to make the generic army guy the villain in all of these? Cone on. If it wasn't 15 years in between these we'd all be mad.5) They say it took so long to make because of the visuals. That's a lie. Looks the same as the first. Some scenes look like a crappy 2010s video game. Telltales Jurassic Park had better underwater visuals. I also heard someone say this had better visuals than Aquaman. No way. Aquaman looked fantastic. This is crap.6) Spider is a weird character. He's like 16 maybe but he's still a child. Yet he's nearly naked. It's creepy.7) Spider is ""family"" only when convenient. Mtiple times they forget about him or leave him behind.8) The second hour drags. So boring. This movie is already too long.9) Characters are only smart or remember things when it's convenient. At one point they need to get around Fire on the water. I don't understand how this is an issue. Swim under it. They hold their breath super long. It's not an issue. Summon those water animals like you did 5 minutes earlier. Swim under. Summon your flying creatures like you did 80 times and fly over. This is plan dumb.They are also afraid to drown in a boat, yet they are all insane swimmers who can hold their breath really long.Spider saves his dad, only to later leave him for a family that left him behind and threatened to kill him?????They go to attack the humans with a bunch of Navi but don't. Then a whale thing attacks and now the Navi are all gone??? They just disappear.Multiple times in this they say Jake and his family are being hunted. They go somewhere else and as for sanctuary. They are then attacked by humans multiple times, yet in the final battle the Chiefs wife says ""you brought them here"". No crap. That's been established like 10 times.There's a ton of other things I didn't like but 15 years for this????? Crap. Give the money to someone else. When the Marvel movies don't rush CGI, it's just as good as this. James Cameron sucks.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","b_velkova","15 January 2023","I watched the first Avatar out of curiosity and I must admit, I appreciated the imagination put into the creation of the initial world. I hated the new age message though and wasn't planning to see any more episodes but, you see, I'm married to a boy who enjoys the visuals, so...... we went to the second Avatar but even my husband was bored after an hour because what we have here is, first of all, a story badly told. In terms of scriptwriting but also - of cutting. The scenes seem randomly ordered, more like for a gallery exhibition rather than for a coherent plot: now, I'll show you this, and now, please, look at that.Second of all, there's no logic neither to the character development, nor to the story itself. Where, for example, comes the rivalry between the two brothers from? We hear of it in a brief exchange between them but that is all. There is no accumulation, no nothing.Why does the little brother feel like a such an outcast as to associate himself with a giant killer fish?An why, the hell, does the killer fish happen to not mean being a killer fish after all? Are we some kind of kids who cannot bear a morally stained character?Why is the big brother left without a story whatsoever? Ah, yes, because of the same reason - the big brother is the only one of importance who dies and we, as the kids we are, cannot bear the death of someone we know, let alone - someone we sympathize with...Storywise, what are the earthlings doing on Pandora anyway? Trying to inhabit it, or take this magical fish juice as to stay forever young? And why focus on one indigenous enemy when the planet is obviously full of armed tribes?Plus, nothing new is added to the alien world - we see the same creatures with the same features but this time - more adapted to water.The message is a chaos. Not that it makes it any less pertinent to just one side of the political spectrum though. The anti-imperialist struggle is somehow combined with tribal values, allowed to some but denied to others. The absurd pacifist whales still need to eat smaller fish to survive and in nature they will definitely choose a weaker victim to guarantee their success. But somehow when we humans do the same, we are monsters from hell and this movie tries to make us rejoice when we see our spices destroyed.Twisted much?Definitely don't count me for a third episode.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","OperativeH","22 January 2023","I am really not sure why Avatar and its sequel are a thing. The first one became the highest-grossing movie of all time, and yet it made zero impact on culture what-so-ever. Just think of the momentum and impact movies like Lord of the Rings, Toy Story or even Twilight created. Regardless of whether you like them or not, one has to admit they made it possible that new genres entered the big stage, they created fanbases that span the whole globe and engage people up to today. But Avatar? At least here in Germany, the movie disappeared from the public conscious after it left theaters. It was a simple story, told in a new (at-that-time) interesting visual way. The story was also finished after the first movie. The humans lost, they left. The End.So I was very skeptical why they would do a sequel to the movie. Even people that liked the first one, cannot name any character beside the two mains. And this sequel is so hollow and devout of creativity and logic it is depressing. As I said, the first movie basically told a finished story. Cameron and two (!) other screenwriters had more than 10 years to come up with a new story. And what did they come up with? Humans invade the Navi-Planet. Again. They could have imagined a new, more nuanced villain. No. They bring back the same cartoonlishly evil guy. They could have added depth to Jack and Neytiri. No, they bring in new, underdeveloped characters, while the two mains become empty extras. Just imagine this: they were not even creative enough to give Neytiri an own personal memory with her eldest son, so instead she watches Jack's instead.The script in terms of dialogue and logic is not good. The ""logic"" of the story falls apart while you are watching it unfold. THe dialogue is hollow. Even the music is creatively bankrupt. James Horner, who died in 2015, wrote the music for the first Avatar. And he just copy-pasted the music he wrote for Apocalypto. And this rip-off is again being used here. It is not enough that the movie looks pretty. Many movies do. Yet they go beyond that and try to tell a compelling story. Avatar 2 is so empty, you forget about it in 2 days. Which is good I guess so you can enjoy the next part (should you decide to watch it), which will be the same story again.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","mattstone137","16 December 2022","Welcome back into the media cycle, James Cameron. Sometimes divisive with critics but always pushing forward, Cameron has often dragged the cinema kicking and screaming into the age of digital wizardry. His contributions to the medium have been rewarded by audiences repeatedly, adored by a burgeoning demographic in the eighties and frequently breaking box office records since releasing Titanic in 1997. But lo! Avatar: The Way of Water may buck the trend - rather than gross the GDP of Suriname, the film may only gross the GDP of Belize - a pittance.The film follows the continuing lives of Jake Sully and Neytiri. When marines return to seek revenge and use Pandora as a second Earth, the couple must flee from their forest home and into the water of a coastal tribe. There, they must learn to adapt to their new home as Colonel Miles Quaritch, cloned and in an avatar body, searches for their whereabouts.Avatar 2 is an impressively large and extraordinarily long film, but there is one constant which is unwaveringly distracting - the high frame rate. Talented filmmakers like Cameron, Ang Lee, and Peter Jackson, occasionally allow hubris to misguide them in their quest for innovation and cutting-edge superficialities.To this end, all three are desperately trying to incorporate a higher frame rate into their films, which is said to make look film more ""realistic,"" a supposition I've never understood. How does an artificially inflated frame rate, the most standardized metric in art, look more natural to viewers who are accustomed, throughout their entire lives, to the previous standard? I humbly speak for the film-going public when I answer, ""it does not.""
Avatar 2 further innovates by switching between (perceived) twenty-four and forty-eight frames per second. Although audiences are gifted less high frame rate, the technique only further distracts, as the film schizophrenically cuts between expected motion and horribly smooth action. It's also bound to greatly confuse those who notice the difference but aren't in the loop as to why or how. If the practice, inconceivably, becomes the standard, I may never see another blockbuster. Death to high frame rates!Any given viewer's reaction to Avatar 2 will largely depend on their opinion pertaining to the state of filmmaking currently, relating to its trajectory since the release of the previous installment. Those pining for the days of practical effects and tangible sets having nothing to look forward to, but those accustomed to CGI spectacles will be comfortably pleased.Avatar 2's effects are not dated, bland, or indulgent; most of the CGI is beautifully textured and necessary for the film's sweeping camerawork and general scope. The problem is that the underlying failures of computer-generated imagery are stalwart: the characters and objects are weightless, and the physics remain uncanny, even if the aesthetics are often breathtaking.In 2009, the ambition of rendering the majority of a live action film in a computer (one which looked magnitudes more convincing than even the most impressive CGI of the time) was daring enough to justify a tradeoff in verisimilitude. The first film became the highest grossing film of all time (no, not adjusted for inflation) because general audiences had never seen such expansive use of CGI outside of a Star Wars prequel.Now...it's all they know. Viewers will see CGI landscapes and effects in at least two trailers immediately preceding the film (Quantumania and Guardians of the Galaxy 3) which are just as colorful, creative, expansive, and busy. They might be cheaper, not as luxuriously rendered or detailed, but the novelty is long dead.Pre-armed with knowledge of the industry over a decade, and the alarming gap between the two films, it's reasonable to assume Cameron would ration considerable time, energy, and attention to his script - he has not. Motivations, character development, and structure are still laughably childish and thin; despite the 195-minute runtime, the film is largely uneventful. Obviously, Cameron's M. O. this time around is showing off the technological progress and giving audiences a 2001-esque peak into his imagined world, but it's not creative or unique enough to warrant the length or simplicity.Filling the void when spectacle fizzles is grating ""character work"" mostly centering around the offspring of our previous protagonists, Jake and Neytiri. The children are seen as outsiders to the new tribe and are challenged to fit in for the sake of peace and harmony, a plotline which derivatively borrows from the first film, itself an already-tired Dances with Wolves retread.This desolate, barren story soil could be given fresh nutrients with intriguing characters or complex dynamics; instead, Cameron bashes his audiences over the head with one of the most well-trodden and insipid themes of the modern age. It's amusing: a character from a preceding Shazam trailer mockingly references the Fast and Furious films and their shallow fixation on ""family,"" which is followed by Avatar 2's three-hour opus to the word. There's probably some dystopian subtext to the recent fetishization of familial love, but the surface-level triteness alone signals a need for a new dead horse to brutalize.Additionally, the dialogue is laughably blunt, a painful mix of direct verbalizations of feelings and irrelevant, throwaway banter, all articulated by way of grade-school-curriculum diction. The first fifteen minutes are also dedicated to narrated exposition, so rushed and pandering that Rise of Skywalker is blushing in the corner. If, as some have said, the first Avatar gained no cultural traction because it simply lacked a story and characters worth remembering, Avatar 2 will suffer the same relative obscurity. I hope the international grosses are worth all the monosyllables.The performances are dutiful but unremarkable. Unlike the original, there's seldom a scene with real humans in the film, so the motion capture is forced to do the heavy lifting. Actors become voice actors, and only Zoe Saldana musters genuine feeling without being seen.To be fair to Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, and Cliff Curtis, the characterizations are too stiff and flat for any detailed emotion. Similarly, Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Duane Evans Jr. Work admirably as the scuffling youngsters.Avatar 2 is exactly what audiences hope it won't be: a retelling of the original film in a different location, excruciatingly predictable and free of any character, thematic, or intellectual intrigue. Every story element and conservational ideal has been done before, and better.However, this was also true of the original; it will be interesting to see if the technological promise and spectacle of the sequel are enough to lure audiences into theaters like they were a decade and change ago. Personally, the film evoked no particular emotion, but it did put me in the mood for Planet Earth. At least David Attenborough provides narration for subjects who can't already talk.","

Even the much touted special effects didn't deliver the wow of the first film.The story is very very basic which leaves plenty of time to get fully emersed into the world of Pandora. Except after a time that world fails to deliver any great discoveries compared to the first film. It feels very much a repeat.What I really don't understand is why the movie had to run for three hours? Nothing is gained by doing this. It seems log for the sake of being long.Its entertaining enough to not be a waste of time and the big screen in 3d will be the best way to see it, as once the effects are diminished in the lounge room the story, or lack of it, will come to the fore :)","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","nicolasroop","17 December 2022","To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This should have been much better than it was. This was basically a rehash of the first movie's plot with added family drama and a switcheroo of who was becoming an avatar.First off, since when did they start growing avatars with human imprints in case someone dies? I thought avatars were piloted by humans and the only reason Jake was different was because their god chose him to be in that body. That part felt completely hamfisted into the film and seemed like an excuse to get some original cast members back.Secondly, where the hell did the human kid come from? There was no mention of him in the first film that I can recall and also seemed completely forced into this already bloated story. I enjoyed some of the extra family drama and characters. It added an extra layer and, to me, that's all it needed. Apparently, not according to James Cameron, who felt the need to bloat this film out to over 3 hours long for seemingly no reason at all other than to stroke his own technical ego. I couldn't help but sit there during certain sequences and think, this really did not need to be in this film and could've been cut with no consequence to the plotline whatsoever.Speaking of plotlines, did I mention this film is essentially a copy and paste effort from the first? They have to leave their island because they are being attacked and they go and learn the ways of the water people, similar to Jake Sully in the first film learning to live with the Na'vi. Then we have some drama here and there, and it all narrows down to the big showdown at the end. In that, I feel like the film lost the storytelling magic that occured in the first film. Also, not having any sort of romance or love story kinda killed the passionate feeling you get when you watch Jake and Neytiri mingling in the original. There is no feeling of love in this film other than the love for family, which basically makes it The Fast And The Furious with water beasts instead of muscle cars.My last gripe that I'll share with you is that it seemed like the creatures in this film were gentrified compared to the first. They all acted like humans for the most part, and lost their native ways and actions in favor of the screenwriter trying to make us connect with the characters, but it honestly had the opposite effect. It made me bored of them almost immediately and generally lost my interest throughout.Now, onto the reason why I rated this a 6 and not a 3. The special effects were outstanding! The IMAX 3D presentation was sublime. Definitely the best use of 3D I think I've seen on screen since the original. I also enjoyed that the entire film filled the screen, instead of films like Top Gun or Marvel movies that only utilize the technology for their action sequences and everything else(80% of the film) is presented with black bars.But here's the kicker for the visual effects that I think Cameron failed with. His use of fast framerate technology. The near constant switching between 60+ frames per second to 24 fps was jarring to say the least. I wished he would've just chose the 24 fps for the whole film. As a gamer who games on a pc with a 240hz monitor, the 60+ fps made it feel like I was watching cinematics from a video game instead of a movie. Some of it I thought looked fantastic, but most of it made me feel like grabbing a controller because it was basically a cut scene from a game. Took me out of the immersion, unfortunately. I do commend him for trying, but I wondered if he actually watched the final product himself and saw how strange it was on the big screen.Overall, it's not a bad movie if you're going to see some cool 3D and wonderfully realized, hyper-realistic animation. Just expect more of the same with this sequel, as opposed to the evolving we would expect from a 13 year production.3 blue beings out of 5.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jamesrupert2014","23 November 2023","After booting the Earthlings off Pandora at the end of the last film, species-traitor Jake Sully, now permanently in blue-face, has settled down with his growing family of hybrids only to be called back to be the great-blue-hope and save the mawkishly spiritual natives when the incredibly awful, but usually incompetent, humans return in force. Like the first Avatar film, the CGI and practical special effects are superb but unlike the first film, we've seen it all before, so they don't make up for the simplistic story, juvenile script, and card-board acting (both by people and CGI entities). James Cameron's flair for action and techno-imagery is on display, as is his almost pathological lack of subtlety as the painfully perfect Na'vi demonstrate, like the Ewoks did before them, that technologically sophisticated weaponry is no match for spears and bows'n'arrows when the latter are wielded by the righteous and/or oppressed (wishful thinking with, sadly, little historical support). In addition to the overly-long and repetitive battle scenes, and colourful but sophomoric 'new-agey' moments, we also have to put up with a lot of 'awkward teenage blues' as the youngsters infiltrate pretty much every scene (and do exactly what you expect they are going to do). IMO, the worst decision Cameron made was to contrive to have the Na'vi be heard in English, which just highlights the weakness of the incredibly clichéd dialogue (especially that of the 'younglings', which seems to be pandering to teenage audiences as the characters all talk as though they learned the language hanging around a mall in 2020, bro). Audibly, the only thing more risible than the dialogue was the Na'vi's incessant 'hissing', a gimmicky trope that was quickly beaten to death (it didn't help that when they weren't hissing, they were speaking perfect contemporary English). All-in-all: cloying, self-righteous, excessively drawn-out, and not particularly interesting, with a premise and plot so message-driven that the entire film might as well be treated as a parable (just a different J. C.).","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tabraham44","15 July 2023","What a waste of time!! Every typical sequel pitfall trope shows up in this movie. It's the exact plot as the 1st one and it's honestly incredibly boring. Visuals are great sure, but it has less effect the 2nd time around from avatar 1 15 years ago. I'm tired of seeing these poor animals get hunted, cities being blown to bits. The human cgi and background mixing is pretty awful. Human military actors are laughable, that Scottish guy is so unbearable. These lines are corny, all the children of the ppl from the last movie make no sense, Sigourney weaver jr. Goes Marvel MCU for a second on them, and i swear if they say ""bro"" one more time I'm gonna lose it!! Easiest 1 out of 10 I'll ever give.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","lthewitt","16 December 2022","Most filmgoers have spent the past decade in agreement that 'Avatar' was okay, but rather clichéd and definitely not deserving of the biggest box office gross of all time. At the time, the special effects were astonishing, zipwiring over the uncanny valley in a way which had never been done before.Of course, now we see that standard of CGI everywhere from video games to the cat in 'Toy Story 4'. So we have to focus on the aspects of filmmaking other than sheer spectacle.It would be very easy to dismiss a film simple because it's popular and expensive, but reviewing this film on its own merits I thought the opening was strong and had the potential to be a very gripping film. It started to falter when the villain from the first film was brought back to life in a new body and immediately started attacking people in his confusion. He is then sat down and forced to watch a video of his human self explaining (and barely understanding) that his memories have been saved so that if anything happens they can be uploaded into a new avatar.The sensible thing to do would have been to save his memory after he's already been told this, so that when the avatar/clone wakes up it would already know what's happened and wouldn't go on a confused rampage.The special effects are very impressive, but the film very slowly becomes a remake of the first film, only set on the coast rather than in the forest. Does anyone care? Is there anything to be gained that wouldn't be from watching the first film again?The twist this time is that Jake has four children and the baddie is planning to cause Jake suffering while also killing off the entire Na'vi race. So when the villain captures threePicture a scenario: you're the most evil man in the world and you're planning to commit genocide, specifically hoping to cause suffering to one man. Then three of his kids come to you, your henchmen take them hostage and you try to use them to lead you to their dad. Instead, they resist you and repeatedly call you a butthole.What do you do? You'd kill or torture one of them so the others would be terrified and do your bidding, right? Well, in this film nobody ever seemed to want to hurt the kids and even the bullets almost always avoid them.So you quickly realise that nobody significant is going to get hurt in the first two hours of the film, by which point you are bored senseless and thinking this will end up being a 4/10. But to make it even worse, the third act is a shameless merger of 'Avatar' and 'Titanic' - if they each became the highest grossing film of all time, why not remake them together? Who cares about integrity, originality or storytelling, right?Not only that, but some scenes are direct remakes of 'The Abyss'. When you've made some big movies, do you feel obliged to just redo the same things? If was incredibly boring to watch.The thing to ask yourself with a sci-fi movie set on another planet (or moon) is: if this were set on earth would I care, or is there something integral to the story which means it must be set on another world? The answer in this case is neither. It would have been very easy to swap those birds for horses and all the other animals for terrestrial animals. What you'd have is an incredibly boring movie. For some people, the visuals might be enough to distract from the lack of substance. I wasn't convinced.The plot holes were glaring. Early on, we discover that everyone knows they can connect these jellyfish to their backs and breathe underwater. So all the characters who drowned could have easily been protected. And it's not as though they have any objection, since the entire world is tailored to fit humanoids. Even the animals they ride have evolved to have a handle on the back and a port to connect their tails.And what are we to make of the character who is supposed to be heroic for spearing fish, then ten minutes later he's judging other people for harpooning a whale's fin. These people 'are connected with nature' only so far as they can see human-like life in the animals they're using. We're told it's wrong to kill a whale because they're very intelligent and can appreciate music - but any other animal is fine to be used. This leads to one random scene where the baddies extract the elixir of life from a dead whale, which is never mentioned again. If there's a material which can stop human aging, would that not be the villains' motivation for everything? Forget about revenge on Jake, you could live forever.The plot makes no sense. The characters are either one-dimentional or have no dimensions or thought whatsoever. The dialogue sounds like it was written by an algorithm, the plot is self-plagiarised, the acting is... well, let's just say it's a good job Zoe Saldana is there, because nobody else was even trying. The main character doesn't even react to a major tragedy in his life.And the absolute lowest point has to be when Spider swims past dozens of dying morally grey characters in order to save a genocidal dictator simply because... no, there's no explanation given. Even the character doesn't give any indication of why he did so. The only reason anybody could possibly give for saving the villain is to make three more shameless sequels.A 1/10 film could potentially become a 3/10 based on its visual prowess - were it not for the case that this is such a shameless cash-grab with not a shred of originality. Still, the nostalgia value will appeal to some and six months from now this film will have taken $1.7bn and be the 7th highest grossing film of all time. Shameless.","

I don't see any difference in the CGi either.If you like teenage angst set in an alien world among blue monkeys who call each other bro and the most predictable storylines ever- please watch this crap.I'd rather watch the first.","

Classic garbage film of shoot em up bang em up. Same old cliches and teenage whining. The irritating part is the human jungle boy and the antagonist. The writing was poor and one of the worst I've seen in a while for a ""blockbuster"" film. A lot of pot-holes in this film. I watched this waterwaste and asking a lot of questions in the film. More of a ""fishbuster"" film to me. I can't believe I'm entering a generation of wasted potential. I guess this culture love these types of foolish films. Another no substance film just like all the movies lately. Hard to find any decent movies or tv shows lately, oh wait... amazing writing doesn't sell... just sex, drugs, shooting and more foolish kindergarten writing. A fish tale and fish bait movie...don't waste your time. It makes me sad because the first Avatar had a better story. Wasted potential.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tm-sheehan","19 December 2022","My Review - Avatar: The Way of Water
My Rating. 10/10Avatar: The Way of Water written directed and produced by James Cameron is the perfect example of a movie that deserves to be seen on the biggest and most high definition Cinema Screen you can find .We saw it on our local GMAX screen and for any movie that has a running time of 3hours 12 minutes to hold this movie goers interest it has to be special.Watching Avatar : The Way of Water on a television screen or tablet of any size would be an insult to the technology geniuses involved in the production and James Cameron's vision .It's been worth a 13 year wait between the first Avatar movie that broke all box office records becoming the top box office lifetime grossing movie of all time earning over $ 2.8 billion .I think one reason for Avatars great success is it's humanity ,which may sound odd as most of the film we are watching non human characters but the characters are warm and vulnerable with many values that we could well duplicate on our own sick planet, especially natural conservation and respect for our declining species of plants and animals.I was a bit doubtful about this sequel after being so underwhelmed by the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever sequel but The Way of Water is one of the most memorable and beautiful movies of the Fantasy Action Adventure genre I've ever seen.In this sequel we get to visit two wonderful worlds for the price of one of beginning in Pandora the Forest Kingdom then moving to the beautiful Kingdom of The Reef People . Jake Sully his partner Neytiri and their children have to flee their Forest Kingdom . They decide it's their only option after being hunted down by Quaritch a hybrid guerrilla Commander with the blue appearance of a Pandoran Na'vi to camouflage their intent and plunder Pandora .s Jake ( Sam Worthington ) leave their forest home behind to seek asylum with the tribes of the Metkayinan Reef people.The Sky invaders have returned to Pandora to colonise the Forest Kingdom due to Earth dying from neglect, overcrowding and lack of conservation does that
sound familiar? Earth today is spending billions of dollars on Space exploration to find intelligent life and suitable conditions for human habitation when we eventually ruin our own planet.There are many similar parallels and situations for humankind to identify with in this movie ,especially the suspicion and lack of acceptance of cultures other than our own . In this case the Reef People who have reason blame Jake Sully for bringing danger and conflict to their Paradise .It is a Paradise of beautiful undersea plants and fantastic creatures on the Metkayina reef including the Tulkun ,giant whale like creatures native to the Oceans of Pandora who possess their own names and culture as well as sophisticated music and poetry.The Tulkun play a vital role in the movie when they are hunted by the Sky invaders from earth to draw Jake Sully out of hiding.Avatar -The Way of Water already holds a number of production records I was interested to read that Kate Winslett who plays Ronal the partner of Tonowari the chief of the Metkayina Clan broke Tom Cruise's underwater Mission Impossible underwater filming record of 6 minutes when she swam underwater for 7minutes and 14 seconds.Also Avatar :The Way of Water is now the 7th film in history with a production cost of over $300million it's estimated the forthcoming sequels which are being filmed back to back will cost approximately $ one billion ,
There will be new worlds to discover in the future Avatar series as it's divided into 4 nations The Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads so we have many visual experiences ahead of unless James Cameron ends the Avatar series after the third movie if The Way of the Water isn't profitable.I doubt he has any worries in that direction as Avatar : The Way ofWater is the epitome of what great cinematic art is all about great skill and great talent but most importantly great vision I hope it succeeds .Special mention to Jack Champion who was very impressive in his role of Spider the young boy left behind in Pandora he plays a real Jungle boy captured by the guerrilla invaders for interrogation in their quest to destroy Jake Sully .Please don't wait for it to stream or the Blue Ray see it at a cinema .","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","loufalce","18 December 2022","After waiting 13 years, James (Titanic) Cameron takes you back to Pandora in the ineviatable sequel, I'll cut to he chase. Sully has married a Na'vi and fathered a family. When their forest world is threatened, they must move to the ocean world and try to survive, but...... There is not one fresh idea in this purple,yellow, green and blue flourescent world. The story element is derived from films like 'Last of the Mohegans', 'Waterworld','Dances with Wolves', Finding Nemo', 'Moana' ' How to Train Your Dragon' ""Fern Gully' and 'Fee Willy'. The CGI and 'motion capture' FX are state of the art even if the lurid colors look like a child's first grade Dayglow painting. There are also some 'new age' platitudes and plenty of environmental babble to placate the leftist global warning cultists. The character development is, well 'surely you cant be serious' the action moves like a snail stuck on a wad of chewing gum, and the violence is, well violent. The underwater sequences obviously cost a fortune to film but even they look flat and listless. There is no sense of humor , not even any good one liners. The only scenes that have some merit are the waterborne military vehicles pictured in an ominous gray. In essence ,its a standard 90 minute action film without much action stretched into a 3 hour plus ass and bladder buster .Its like being on the Disney 'Na'Vi River Adventure ride for an eternity. You'll be satisfied in half an hour if you can contend with the excess. A truly mediocre movie designed for non discriminating multiplex morons and franchise film freaks. Another P. U .movie review from Lou. Happy Holidays and wishing you BETTER film going in 2023.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","JerlskovFlunkhede","23 January 2024","10-15 years ago you could make a movie with great cgi and no story, and the audience would love it. Today, great cgi is a minimum requirement, it's taken for granted. It's nothing special. That's why you better have a damn good story, great graphics are not awe-inspiring anymore.Sadly, they forgot to bring the good story in this film. It's just a rehash of Avatar 1 + irrelevant teenage stuff + silly American hero worship + your standard war film. They've created something completely generic, the story has been told a thousand times, and better.It's sad, really. The Avatar 1 universe is wonderful, they could have created something truly unique - or maybe they should have left it alone.","

The corporation face against the tribe(s) of Pandora is named Quaritch. The film has a message of protecting the planet, but also is a huge war spectacle with gigantic explosions..sound familiar? No, this isn't the plot for ""Avatar"" that came out in 2009, this is the plot for the new 2022 sequel, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"". Just like 2015's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a repackage of the 1977 classic ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", this film does the same. Add the ocean instead of the rainforest, add whale-like creations instead of flying dragon-like creations, and sprinkle in some children. It is the same film, complete with some scenes that are so similar the view may think he/she/they are watching the 2009 film. I hope the 3rd film and so on will introduce some new ideas.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","altsgrd","26 December 2022","This movie is defintely worth a watch. The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning - so much so that you actually tend to forget how incredible it is while watching it since it is so masterfully done throughout.I rewatched the first Avatar the same day as I went to see this one, and even though there are some obvious changes made to the story and the universe itself, it isnt done with too much consequense to the overall experience so all good there.The only real criticism I have to give is regarding the story/plot - or the lack thereof. While the first movie had an extremely simple and unoriginal story at least there was one. Avatar: The Way of Water seamingly has no plot or considerable storyline at all and sets out mainly to show off its visual superiority which makes it seem a bit hollow. Naturally this is a shame but I will still recommend this movie for the visuals and the delightful reunion with the universe of Pandora.","

It's like staring at a perfect video game played by someone else. At first you are amazed by the perfect graphics, you want to play too, but you can't and then you just stare blankly. The action scenes are absolutely horrible. God, Water World with Kevin Costner was incomparably better than this. I expected it to be nothing much, but I never thought it would be so shocking. What on earth were they doing for 13 years? Disastrous music, terrible finale, non-existent script, extremely unlikeable characters, endless length. Boring, boring, boring and just boring.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","FeastMode","16 December 2022","Let's jump right in and talk about the visuals. They are, to the full extent of the word, unbelievable. I was in complete awe throughout the movie. The details are ridiculous. A new standard has been set.I have to gush a little more. The original Avatar had groundbreaking visuals, but The Way of Water is MILES ahead. I couldn't imagine how much better it could get. And there are hundreds of stunning shots and beautiful images. As South Park taught us, James Cameron is always raising the bar.As for the overall movie, I thought it was pretty awesome, but not as good as the first (8 stars). I was more emotionally invested in the story for the original. I remember being legitimately angry at the sky people.And while the first one is so fast-paced, this one slows down drastically in the middle portion. It's still enjoyable but we stray from the main story and fill it with less important stuff like bullying drama. I think it was also slowed down by maybe showing off a little too much with the visuals. The original had a great balance of story and showing off.I had a great time with this chapter and look forward to more. I'm not entirely sure 3D is worth it, but IMAX is a must since the entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 12/15/2022, IMAX 2/7/2023)","

Sigourney Weaver, Jermaine Clement, Giovanni Ribisi & others add minor support - but don't justify the 3hrs+ of James Cameron, Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver's drawn out yet simplistic screenplay (that sets up yet another bloated Hollywood franchise btw). Its big budget & A-list director Cameron do make it visually STUNNING... but it's still a disappointment.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","passenger70","17 December 2022","Problems. This films got 'em. The main one being that James Cameron thinks that we all want to take a holiday on Pandora, a world that is nowhere near as cool as he thinks it is. Secondly, every character has turned into a blue alien now - even the bad guy. Jake Sully has a tonne of kids and they all look like him! There are so many identical looking characters I couldn't tell them all apart . Finally the plot is so simplistic and can be summed up as follows: Hour 1 - Hero has a family now and they are under threat. Hour 2 - Family runs away to hide and goes swimming. Hour 3 - Villains find them and there is a battle. The end. Save the Alien Whales is the ultimate message of this film - an ideal we have been aware of for 50 years. To remind us of this Cameron has to create a lot of evil Earth people who have somehow forgotten their own history. Could happen but ultimately you walk out being reminded not to do something you grew up knowing was wrong and Jim spent millions on this redundant message. The whole thing played like a crazy sequel to The Sound of Music where the Von Trapps run off to the Bahamas and get pursued by Nazi U-boats. Kate Winslet totally disappeared and I'm not even sure which character she played. Sigourney Weaver however was excellent as usual and her character stood out in a literal sea of CGI clones.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","ItsJakeyy","26 January 2023","While being a visual feast for the eyes on the surface level, Avatar: The Way of Water has nothing beneath the waves to hold viewers for the over three-hour runtime.First, let's get it out of the way. This movie looks very pretty. The CGI work to make not only the Navi, but the entire world look realistic is incredibly impressive. Unfortunately, these fantastic visuals are not presented in any interesting way. The cinematography leaves much to be desired. It is not bad per se, but nothing is done to uplift the incredible CGI work. Once the luster of the visuals fade, there is not much to hold the viewers eye for the rest of the movie. This is also overlooking the strange framerate issues that pop-up throughout the film. These inconsitencies immediately pull you out of the experience.Outside of visuals, Avatar: The Way of Water has little story to justify its runtime. The middle portion of this film needed a weed-whacker to cut away at least 30-minutes, if not more. The characters offer very little to keep the audience interested, and outside of a handful of well acted scenes and emotional moments, there is little fat on this steak.And that this is the movie's biggest flaw. Why, with an over three-hour runtime, does this movie feel so empty? It's because it is. Devling past the surface-level beauty, viewers will find very little to tide them over.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","pd-19490","18 December 2022","It's a good movie overall but certainly not the emotional epic that it seems its director wants to believe it is. The visuals are stunning but the story is heavy handed again and lacking in depth. If your story includes dialogue like the following then it lacks emotional depth: ""BRO. We've got to go now!"" ""I know cuz, I'm coming!"" ""Ok bro!"" It's still worth seeing in the theater for the visuals and the action sequences. And honestly the movie doesn't feel like it's over 3 hours. It's just disappointing that they couldn't come up with better dialogue and story than this in 13 years. I'm hoping now that they have the effects in place for the next films, maybe they can spend their time crafting effective stories and dialogue to accompany the fantastic visuals. This is a good but not great movie and one that I probably won't go out of my way to see again. Contrast that with Top Gun: Maverick, a film that was made with half the budget but lots of heart and fantastic action. I'd love to see that one again.","

I watched it on streaming service so I think I may have been more engaged by the visuals in the cinema. Either way, at home it is largely a waste of time and effort.

It's so bright and vibrant, I saw it in 3D, I'm not sure I'd recommend that over a regular viewing, that's my plan for tomorrow.It was long, but it's one of those films that moves on by quickly, I didn't fidget or shuffle about, meaning I was engrossed in the story.At times it's a little corny, and some of the dialogue will make you want to roll your eyes, but in the context it's a minor irrigation. There was a degree of predictably and inevitability about it, but who cares.I see the new one comes out in 2024, so not too long to wait.I enjoyed it, if I'm honest id hoped for a bigger plot, 7/10.","

In most other ways, it's a nothingness of a film. It drifts between formulaic and nonsensical.It's hard to believe that, with thirteen years to play with, that James Cameron and friends didn't find the time to write a good story. Sully and family run away, they get found, battle ensues, people dies, bad guy survives just in time to star in the next sequel. Along the way, we meet a variety of characters who would be wearing red uniforms if this was Star Trek. What a waste of three hours!Also, I have key questions: in this one they aren't going for unobtanium, they now want the brain juice of the giant animals (can anyone say Pacific Rim 2?), and they proudly proclaim that a large vial is worth $80m. How much did the mission and infrastructure cost? How can they possibly recoup their money? Where did they find this many employees so eager to murder an entire ecosystem?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Holt344","19 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water begins similar to the first installment and then becomes this magnificent story about fatherhood and family; about loss, humanity, nature and of dangers of corporate greed that director-writer-producer James Cameron executes brilliantly. James Cameron used real world problems with the rainforest for the first film and here he does a similar thing but with poaching. It fits the story and the world so well of the Avatar franchise. You notice it as much with this film as its predecessor how big of a passion project it truly is for Cameron. Back then he brought us a whole new world to experience and ground breaking technology to witness. With The Way of Water, he does it again, showing more of Pandora through its sea tribes; meaning new culture, underwater sign language and the new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before.Jake Sully lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role. New cast members include Kate Winslet as Ronal; a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, Cliff Curtis as Tonowari; the chief of the reef people clan of Metkayina and Ronal's husband. Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore; the commander in charge of the RDA's interests, and Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin; a marine biologist. The Sully family have grown to include James Flatters as Neteyam; Jake and Neytiri's first son and oldest child. Britain Dalton as Lo'ak; Jake and Neytiri's second son. Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey (""Tuk""), Jake and Neytiri's eight-year-old daughter and their youngest child. But also an adopted teenage daughter called Kiri who's played by Sigourney Weaver, also Jack Champion as Miles Socorro (""Spider""); the teenaged son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was rescued and adopted by Jake and Neytiri and ""prefers his time in the Pandoran rainforest"". The acting was mostly superb, except for Spider who was played by Jack Champion (a newcomer) although an important supporting character, his acting was ranging from good to bad, mostly average. But let's dig into the great performances, starting with Sigourney Weaver as Kiri, Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage daughter. Just the idea of someone aged 73 is playing a teenager through motion capture, it shows her acting range, a brilliant performance. I expected Zoe Saldana to have more to do, but I think she'll have an even bigger role in the third film, she was terrific though and had one of the better performances. Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang were also phenomenal. The performance that surprised me the most were Britain Dalton as Lo'ak, what a great performance, truly. He has a future in the business. That's what I love about James Cameron, his casting. Like Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, but also giving Sigourney Weaver another role after her death in Avatar which was one great and memorable death but also a brilliant performance. I also found that The Way of Water had more emphasis on drama and acting, the longer run time is a reason for that, the actors really got to act, but also learning to free dive. The cast did most and some even did all the underwater stunts, which is impressive.James Cameron co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes), with a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. The writing is in my opinion quite great, mostly, my criticism is at the end of my review. The direction and James Cameron's hard work is one of the film's highlights like the previous film was. Having read interviews before and after having seen the film at the cinema, I've read how supportive and great he was at giving direction to the actors. It's his vision and visual storytelling that makes him one of the greatest. Not many have succeeded with sequels, James Cameron have done it again and again (Terminator 2 and Aliens), and now he did it with The Way of Water.The visual effects and CGI these days, these last couple of years, have been extremely bad in comparison to this film. Avatar: The Way of Water has scenes full of visual effects, each frame with so much to please your eye, scenes with so much going on that multiple rewatches is on my agenda. It's a treat for your eyes, a real eye pleaser. The groundbreaking technology and visual effects is two of the major things that made Avatar into the memorable and biggest movies of all time, along with a lot of other things. But Pandora, the mind blowing planet that are so easy to get immersed to, the Na'vi and everything that went into them. For this film we got to see the sea tribes and thus getting to see the new technology James Cameron helped create, performance capture in underwater scenes. This man have changed lifestyle during the first Avatar and the second, but one thing that haven't changed is his love for the franchise, his passion, a true master at work. I also want to praise the cinematography, Russell Carpenter (who won an Oscar for Titanic) does some brilliant work, photographing so many stunning looking shots with spectacular angles. Overall perfect. Cameron and him are a great duo, you see it in each scene regarding how it was shot. Also, the editing deserves some praise, music definitely needs it. Whilst James Horner is missed (having done the musical score for Avatar), Simon Franglen comes in and does an amazing job, giving us a score both gripping and emotional. He's a great replacement for the maestro, James Horner.I've heard people calling it too long and for me and my girlfriend, the 192 minute runtime felt right as time flew by quick. Scenes could have been trimmed, sure, but lots of the drawn out scenes of nature and overall slower pace is there for a reason. Character development, mostly for Kiri who is the spiritual in the family. I actually think the film could have been longer, but this length is perfect for the film. In the writing and overall story, I think The Way of Water is better in every way than its predecessor. Yet it have been criticized for having a thin narrative. Yeah sure it doesn't have this mind-blowing narrative, it's actually quite simple, but it works so well because of the visual effects and Pandora as we get to explore lands uncharted to us viewers. Thus the simplicity works here, it's a story about fatherhood. Like what Sam Worthington said in an interview; ""He could have quite easily told the story of Jake and Neytiri going on battling the wars,"" says Worthington (who, like Saldana, has three children of his own), ""but when you add in the kids and having to keep them safe, or not wanting them to emulate you because it can get them killed, they're operatic themes.""Avatar: The Way of Water currently has a critic score of 77% and an audience score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, a site I normally never visit, film critics have more knowledge of film than most audience. I think it's fair, but honestly, I love this film and agree with film organizations; organizations such as the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Avatar: The Way of Water as one of the top ten films of 2022. I agree with that, completely. Also worth noting is how the film also received numerous other accolades, including nominations for the Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director at the 80th Golden Globe Awards. Avatar 3 is coming in 2024, I'm ready. The Way of Water was everything I wanted for a sequel, but more. It's a magnificent film, with groundbreaking technology and visuals, a true visual masterpiece.","

I mean, it was a very well done movie and Jame Cameron never fails to satisfy it seems but I just didn't think it was as good as his previous masterpieces.Avatar Way of Water was VERY visually awesome!! And was very entertaining and had me on the edge of my seat. Great movie. It was a little long but overall, my wife and two daughters loved it as well. It had a great message and great acting by all. We saw it in 3D and that was awesome as well and highly recommended. Go see it.. I mean, you have to right?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Littleman95","8 April 2023","Story: I even fear call it ""story"". It's filled with nonsense and extremely simple excuses or goals. Even the message they want to send is messed up.Visual Effects: thankfully this side of the movie is good as the first one. Even if there are not actually new things (all copied from the first one or the real world).Soundtrack: it was enjoyable and good as the first one, sincerely talking.Conclusion: this movie is just to watch, there's nothing else to do. Shut down your brain and enjoy the visual, otherwise you'll face the story side and, well, it will make it worst. It's totally a shame, really, the main idea could be good but the way they developed it was totally nonsense. Ah, now that I'm thinking about the main idea of the movie thoroughgly, I would say that even that was nonsense. Really, I'm not joking, don't worsen the good taste the first Avatar movie leave to you watching this one.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tendobear","11 June 2023","Oh man, what an absolutely horrendous movie, I'm only rating 4/10 for the visuals. Zero story, terrible characters, horrendous dialogue, and inexplicably long. I actually felt so bored within the first 20 minutes. The messages were preachy and completely in your face. This was just a poor excuse for some legendary Cameron aggrandising; essentially just a vanity project. To be honest I had such a hard time telling who's who because none of the characters really stood out, they were all just this big blue (or turquoise) blob. I know people only watch this movie for the spectacle and the eye-candy, and that's all it is. However, not even the visuals were that great - I was expecting to be absolutely blown away, but they were just OK. The creature designs were also nothing special to be honest - for example there's these creatures called Tulkuns that are essentially humpback whales with a few more fins. The action set pieces aren't anything to write home about neither. Promises so much but delivers very little.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","dummiejo-90918","17 April 2023","I was torn between the good and the bad reviews in here and wasn't sure if I should give this movie a chance. In the end, I thought just the visuals alone would be worth it.Indeed the visuals didn't disappoint. Stunning beautiful landscapes, animals, lights, colors and small details. The blue guys looked awesome too, haha.First 30 minutes started better than I had expected, as I was determined to forgive small story holes and how this one followed a different path as to why humans entered Pandora.Then, followed a story hole so big that it took away any suspense out of the movie.Jake Sully, a courageous leader, became suddenly someone who let his tribe alone. He chickened out. The humans could get the exact location of his tribe, but he just wanted to let the war behind him and protect his family, in this way putting his whole former home in jeopardy.It's a noble thinking, to chose peace, the only issue... The humans were specifically hunting HIM and he would be chased down wherever he went. So the decision to go to the water tribe, set them in danger too and even their Leaders had the same concern, but then they accepted to hospitality them.What followed was exact that. Jake put in danger his new tribe and his family multiple times.The middle section was also way too long and even the visuals could not push the boredom away. It was so long that I started to forget what was the movie about.The action scenes were mostly forgettable. You couldn't connect to the actors either, as their behaviour couldn't be followed. Their characters were written shallow and some dare I say were portrait as spoiled kids who never did what they were told to.It's not a bad movie and worth watching for one time, but the story writing could be bounds and miles better, leaving a bitter taste after watching this. It could have been so much better and they missed to capture the opportunity.","

To create complete water world with ocean creatures is a joy to watch. Sam, Zoe, Kate and all cast did good job in their role. This sequel is worth and waiting for other parts. Whole theatre was immersed in the visual spectacle and at the end of the movie everyone are still sitting and watching rolling credits.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","neil-476","19 December 2022","After flinging the humans out of Pandora (apart from a few friends who remained) the Na'vi settled back into idyllic life. Jake and Neytiri now have a family - two teen sons, a young daughter, a teen daughter (who is actually the mysterious daughter of Sigourney Weaver / Grace's avatar), and a human lad called Spider who was too young to be packed into cryosleep. Then, guess what? The humans arrive back in force for a bit more planet-scale rape. And this time they are accompanied by a batch of avatar marines whose leader is implanted with the mind and memories of Quaritch, the baddie from the first film, who has a grudge against Jake. When it becomes clear that this squad is hunting Jake and family, the small griup flees the forest and takes refuge with a clan on an island.The story of Avatar came in for criticism because of being derivative, and a similar criticism can be levelled here. The story is adequate, but we've seen it before. Having said that, the film is over 3 hours long and doesn't drag. It does take some time for the new young characters to be distinguished from each other, but we know them by the end. The film is essentially a retread of its predecessor, but with major changes in location/milieu and the added complications of family at risk. For me, that was plenty for me to be invested with.As before, the visuals are absolutely outstanding. The world of Pandora is, again, completely immersive, and even more so given that a large part takes place in and under the water this time. The action is terrific.There is a major plot point which is brought up and then left unresolved. Because this film ends halfway through. And I'm already looking forward to the next part.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","loikwonghung","14 December 2022","With over a decade of technology improvement, the movie provides even better visuals, more believable CGI(not that the first one didn't), it also continues the beautiful cinematography.But, the script is far inferior to the last one. The movie tries to focus on ""family"", and with Jake and Neytiri already had a movie, this one focus heavily on the children. But most of the plot lines fall into the trap of being a set-up for sequels. A few plots left unanswer in the end and a few plots begin after the mid point and already wrap after just after being introduced. Some of the charcaters are downgraded into 1 dimensional and some do not learn anything meaningful throughout the story. And the focus of the movie shifts completely once entered the third act which diminishes all the set-up from before.In conclusion, definitely a must watch, better visuals but slightly worst script.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tobyshjones","29 January 2023","I'm over 50 and have been a cinephile all my life and frankly the general trend in sci Fi since Star Wars has been to go big on effects and less devoted to the story line which all are very similar . Greed , revenge, and a fight sequence at the end that goes on for ever.Avatar 2 is no exception. It looks gorgeous , and one has to admire the technology in rendering such lifelike animation using modern motion capture. This is the part which I don't mind. The story however is more of the same , the film is too self indulgent at times and drags on too long . Just because a sequence looks gorgeous or lots of money has been spent on it, doesn't mean it has to be included.The music is forgettable and there is no signature or motif that one remembers, the ending is underwhelming and unresolved , it implies more of the same in avatar 3, Sam worthington's acting is stilted, the screenplay is not well written or exciting, there are no big surprises or twists and there is no humour or relief . My 12 yr old daughter thought it was forgettable and too long. But, it looks amazing; shame someone can't do something original with this technology.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","anoopktm","23 January 2023","Terminator, Aliens, Titanic all were great movies with James Cameron stamp on them. Avatar in 2009 too became one of its kind. But Avatar :The Way of the Water, not sure it really make some difference.There were 5 brains invested in the story department. But one integral part missing in the movie was a story. The special effects were very realistic and outstanding. But seriously, for a layman the effects seen in the 2009 version and this sequel is not really different or great, its all the same. It was same old illumintaed algae, sea.shells, underwater creatures, terrains all the same. To an extend, felt like watching underwater edition of Planet Earth documentary.Ok, now what about a sensible story? The theme is very very weak. The story never justifies all those spectacular special effects. There is nothing to hook you to the plot. Its too shallow. Even a 3 year old can predict what is going to happen. There is a huge disconnect between the story and audience. The movie doesn't converse with audience's mind. Personally did not digest the idea of hunting an ex-marine who has already left the field and living a life minding his own business. There is no strong motivation for a revenge. There was not a single moment in the movie where I could say 'Wow this is awesome'I would say, James Cameron should not end his iife hanging behind this Avatar series. He should realise that Avatar is already achieved what it could've achieved and nothing interesting is going to come out from this Blue Men Group. The more he churn out of the same, people will get bored. He should invest his time and energy for his quest for special effects in meaningful movies. I would love to see more iconic movies from Director James Cameron, and definitely not more of the blue people tragedies.","

The movie looks absolutely stunning!! Most of the time i couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't! Thats how real it looks! Every piece of scenery is something to admire! The visuals might not be as groundbreaking as they were back in 2009, but they are still some of the best i have seen in a movie! Cameron expertly crafted this world that you just immerse yourself in!I Also enjoyed the story as it was not following a formular we have seen before, as the first one did where er could recognize the story from other pieces of media! The new characters were great as well and i just really enjoyed exploring this world with them! At the end of the movie it also became obvious that there are still 3 more movies to go as it doesnt quite feel like a conclusion or solution to what was set up!I dont Know if it is better than the first movie as i see this more as a cinematic event! If you want to watch this movie, watch it in theaters! Watching it at home will not give you the full experience.. trust me!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","matthewreinink","16 November 2023","This is yet another sequel that doesn't justify its own existence. The protagonists are back, the villain is back, once again the native people must defend their land from an imperialist genocidal military looking to deprive them of their resources. It's almost the exact same movie with some slight differences. Except this time there is no longer the novelty of experiencing this world for the first time.It's also frustrating by to see that some characters have significant plot armor. Take the character named spider. He is abducted by the military at the beginning of the movie. Later on he causes the crash of the large ship he is being held captive on. Yet inexplicably he is kept alive and even taken to a life boat as part of the evacuation. These villains have been shown to be ruthless murderers that don't seem to be concerned about potential war crimes. Why would they keep this kid alive once he led them to Jake? Especially since his father was not present, they would just shoot that kid. This is just one of many examples.This movie is not worth going out of your way to see. It is boring, it has nothing to add to the original, and it is entirely too long. It took them ten years to come up with this?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","evanston_dad","24 January 2023","""Avatar"" was a completely immersive experience. Sitting in the theater with my 3-D goggles on, I remember feeling like I had never seen anything quite like it. It was one of those movies, like ""Star Wars,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""The Matrix,"" that brought visual effects forward in leaps and bounds and expanded the scope of what movies could do.""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" felt very underwhelming in comparison. Those visual effects aren't all that impressive anymore, or at least they're not fresh. The motion capture is much improved -- my kids were amazed when I told them they weren't just watching actors in makeup -- but the rest is just a CGI fest that you've seen a hundred times before. I didn't see this film in 3-D, so maybe that was part of my disappointment. But if your movie sinks or swims based on whether you see it in 3-D or not, it's probably not that good of a movie in the first place.The story of this one is rubbish. My heart sank when I realized they were bringing back the same exaggerated caricature of a villain and making this a revenge story. That's the best they could do? And they want to make four more movies out of this? I'll pass. This entire movie felt like filler, setting up a bunch of plot strands to be resolved in later episodes, but the problem is that I don't care enough about any of them to bother seeing how they're resolved.The whales were cool.Grade: B-","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","murlimohanrao","18 December 2022","On my 10 year old son's persistent demands, I watched #AvatarWayOfWater yesterday evening. I was interested too but not as much as my son. There is enough feedback online on the movie being long, monotonous etc. Here I am presenting my views on the movie. Hope it is interesting enough.I watched the 3D, English version of the movie even though other languages were available. The only reason was that regional languages usually mess up the translation of English movies. What I have seen is that the feedback of negativity has largely come from people watching other languages.The movie starts off where the first part ends. Jake Sully has amalgamated into the Navii community and is leading a happy life with his wife and children. But, that is about to end when the Sky force comes back with greater power and in the Navii form to extract revenge by eliminating Jake Sully. Jake realises that this time, victory would not be easy and so runs away from his forest community to seek refuge in the water world clan of Naviis. The rest of the movie is about whether Jake succeeds and what price he ends up paying for success.Before I talk about VFX, I have to comment on the skill with which James Cameron has given space to emotions. For all its VFX, Avatar 2 is an extremely emotional movie about a family's fight for its existence. The skill with which he uses VFX to tell this story is amazing. The movie has huge VFX portions, but it does not take your attention away from the storyline or emotions.The VFX indeed is pathbreaking. I had seen the first Avatar in one of the largest IMAX screens in the world in US and I had great expectations therefore on the second one and believe me, it did not disappoint me. The climax portion of around 35-40 minutes indeed takes your breath away. The underwater visuals are so skilfully done that you become a part of the movie itself. You literally feel the water on your skin.Just don't believe any of the negative reviews. Simply go and watch. Its a long movie no doubt and you need some level of patience to dig into the movie. Believe me, its not time wasted.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","kevin_robbins","16 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) is a movie that we saw as a family last night in the theatre. The storyline picks up after the previous film with Jake an Avatar, happily married and with a family of his own. When the military returns and it is overheard their mission is to kill Jake and his family, they move from the woods and go into hiding with the people of the water. How long can they hide before the humans find them...and finding Jake may not be their only motive...This movie is directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Sam Worthington (Clash of the Titans), Sigourney Weaver (Alien), Stephen Lang (Don't Breathe), Zoe Saldana (Guardians of the Galaxy), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joel David Moore (Dodgeball), CCH Pounder (Robocop 3) and Cliff Curtis (Sunshine).The special effects in this movie are absolutely stunning and the underwater elements are beautiful and very well done. The characters, both known and new, are fascinating and very entertaining. From a storyline standpoint, this might not be as good as the first film, and there's an overuse of the children for cause-and-effect moments, but it is still science fiction gold and worthwhile. I always adore how these movies highlight the impact of colonialism on culture, nature and the indigenous people. The action scenes are out of this world, whether it is action in nature or the more traditional shootouts, explosion and hand to hand combat. Everything about this picture is fun.Overall, this was worth the wait, a science fiction masterpiece that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend.","

It was mere copy paste of the first part except that the story took place in island instead of jungle.Movie's runtime also felt little bit long but given that we were given new info about the islands and there people, the long runtime was justified.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","vacavilleca","12 June 2023","An Underwhelming Dive: A Critical Review of Avatar: Way of the WaterIntroduction:
James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar, left an indelible mark on the world of cinema, captivating audiences with its groundbreaking visual effects and immersive storytelling. With the release of Avatar: Way of the Water, the highly anticipated sequel, fans eagerly awaited another exhilarating journey into the fantastical world of Pandora. However, despite the lofty expectations, the film falls short, delivering a lackluster experience that fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor.Plot and Pacing:
One of the major shortcomings of Avatar: Way of the Water lies in its plot and pacing. While the original film showcased a richly developed narrative that seamlessly blended action, romance, and environmental themes, the sequel feels disjointed and haphazard. The story lacks a clear focus, meandering between various subplots that fail to engage or captivate. As a result, the film feels bloated and overly long, dragging the viewer through a series of convoluted twists and turns that ultimately lead to an unsatisfying climax.Character Development:
Another disappointment in Avatar: Way of the Water is the lack of meaningful character development. In the first film, viewers were introduced to relatable and complex characters who underwent personal transformations throughout the story. However, the sequel fails to build upon these foundations, relegating the characters to mere caricatures of their former selves. Their motivations are poorly defined, and their actions lack depth, leaving the audience disconnected from their struggles and triumphs. It is disheartening to witness the regression of beloved characters who were once so integral to the success of the franchise.Visual Effects:
One aspect where Avatar: Way of the Water does excel is in its visual effects. As expected from a James Cameron film, the CGI is top-notch, and the vibrant world of Pandora is brought to life with stunning detail. However, while the visuals are impressive, they alone cannot salvage the film from its narrative shortcomings. It feels as though the focus was placed primarily on the visual spectacle, sacrificing a compelling story in the process. While the eye-catching visuals momentarily capture attention, they ultimately become hollow without a strong and engaging narrative to support them.Environmental Themes:
One of the defining features of the original Avatar was its exploration of important environmental and conservation themes. It served as a cautionary tale about the destructive nature of human greed and the need to protect our planet's fragile ecosystems. Regrettably, Avatar: Way of the Water fails to build upon these themes in a meaningful way. The environmental message is diluted and lacks the impact and urgency that made the first film so thought-provoking. Instead of inspiring audiences to reflect on their relationship with the natural world, the sequel feels like a missed opportunity to continue the conversation about environmental stewardship.Conclusion:
Avatar: Way of the Water ultimately disappoints, failing to recapture the magic of its predecessor. With a disjointed plot, shallow character development, and a diluted environmental message, the film falls short of its lofty expectations. While the visual effects are undoubtedly impressive, they cannot compensate for the lack of a compelling narrative. It is disheartening to witness the decline of a franchise that once held so much promise. Ultimately, Avatar: Way of the Water is an underwhelming and forgettable addition to the Avatar universe.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Prismark10","5 January 2023","Avatar was a visual tour de force with the storyline borrowed from Dances with Wolves or is it Pocahontas.The belated sequel is another visual feast in 3D. It probably is the first 3D movie I have seen in years. At least James Cameron knows how to make the best out of the format as others do post 3D conversions.The 3D is brilliantly realised both in the jungle world and the sea world. Although you do wonder at times if you are watching a CGI motion capture animated movie or a live action one.The trouble is the storyline is hackneyed. I was reminded of the Matrix sequels where Agent Smith was brought back as the antagonist even though he was defeated in the first movie.Some of the movie did not even make sense. The Earth is dying and the Sky People have returned from Earth to colonise the moon Pandora. A year later ruthless Marine, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is resurrected as an Avatar of a native Na'vi along with others.Their job is to track down and kill Jack Sully (Sam Worthington) whose consciousness became part of a Na'vi Avatar body. He has been leading the resistance against the Sky People.Now Sully has to flee with his family to keep the forest tribes safe. He seeks sanctuary with an aquatic clan in the reef islands of Pandora.Given the Sky People had returned, some of them are hunting the Tulkin sea creature. You would have thought both people would had united to repel the prospective invaders. Not just for harvesting Pandora's resources but they are planning to repopulate it.At over 3 hours, this is a long movie. It is a kind of film you get the most out of in the cinema, I doubt I would watch it again on home viewing.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","4liReza","15 December 2022","Finally, after 13 years of waiting...I'm trying to avoid talking nonsense, but I've never seen anything like this from a technical and visual point of view. It's riveting, maybe too riveting, so that sometimes I missed the main points of the story because I was staring at Pandora's fish. I re-watched the first Avatar last month and was basically ""it was pretty good"". {But} the sequel has much better and deeper characterizationIn this new three-hour movie, James Cameron can turn any viewer into a big fan of his own franchise, who are eagerly waiting for the next movies. The movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is considered as a new beginning for this franchise and Cameron was able to further develop the script and characters and remove the weakness of the first movie. He has also created one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences.Unsurprisingly, the film is a visual masterpiece with rich use of stunning 3D scenery so I definitely suggest you all to see this movie in IMAX 3D. Because without this, you cannot enjoy the movie enoughI was hoping James Cameron would make a slight improvement in the visuals, but these visuals are amazing. Stunning frames one after another. But what I've noticed most is how technical feats are always used in the service of character and world-building.You will find out by watching this movie, James Cameron is a master of technology... and his direction in this film is the most accurate of its kind. Overall, the film is a technological marvel with a breathtaking worldContrary to some critics, I must say that this film is at its best in terms of story, spectacle, spirituality and beauty of this filmmaking and storytelling.As I was already sure, this movie will easily receive several Oscars, including the best special effects and direction, and that it will undoubtedly break records at the box office (2 billion), probably!In the end, I have to say that James Cameron has managed to create a sea and galaxy epic that only he can handle. The movie ""Avatar 2"" is a strange, delightful, dark and very blue work. James Cameron is still miles ahead of the rest.","

As James Cameron tells us that Avatar 5 will see 'action on Earth' - An Earth 200 years from now. Well gonna go see it again next weekend for sure.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Benslie","19 December 2022","The biggest thing for me when it came to this movie was the story for it. I was worried about how exactly they would continue this story naturally and keep the audience interested as well. While I do think the story was able to do all of that I also still think it might've needed a few more edits to make it a bit better. What I enjoyed the most was the family element in this movie. Obviously, between the first movie and this one, it was inevitable that Jake and Neytiri would have a family of their own. So I really enjoyed getting to see how connected this family is and showing the different dynamics in it as well. They felt like a real family with how the siblings would stand up for each other one second and the next just make fun of them. But due to how many new characters there are in this movie an important thing to have is balance. When a movie has new characters to introduce and have the audience build connections with them it's important to give them all enough time to develop and show their dynamics with other characters. Although I would love to say this movie does a good job balancing all of the characters in it, I can't say that fully. When it comes to the kid characters in particular the story does a good job of spending time on them depending on how important they are. But when it comes to the other characters in this movie at times I forgot they even existed due to how little screen time they get. I can see why in this movie Jake and Neytiri weren't shown as much but there was one character, in particular, I was surprised didn't get that much screen time.Spider, played by Jack Champion, despite being an interesting character didn't get that much screen time which was disappointing. He had so much potential to be this really interesting character to study but just ends up being forgotten along the way. But he wasn't the only new character who was just tossed to the side but also a lot of the Metkayina's were also just pushed to the side. I feel like when it came to pushing characters to the side it primarily affected the water tribe and none of the characters there were fully fleshed out. So many of them just ended up being flat characters and I really hope in future movies they get more screen time so they can be proper static characters. I think the biggest reason why some of the other characters who aren't a part of the Sully family get pushed to the side is due to the part of this story I didn't really enjoy which is the sky people returning. I'm not against them returning and kind of figured they were going to return it's just how they choose to have them return. In particular, how they decided to have Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, return to be the big bad in this movie. I will applaud the movie for actually addressing how this is possible, despite it making zero sense, but I wish they created a new bad guy for this movie. But that wasn't my only problem with the sky people's storyline which is that it didn't feel fully thought out. There were two different storylines going on with the sky people with one of them just randomly being forgotten about and the other one literally appearing out of nowhere. I can see what the ideas were for this but I wish they had just adjusted it a bit to make it a bit more interesting. It's also because of this that at times the movie feels like it comes to a screeching halt. Overall, the pacing of this movie was surprisingly well done and I didn't notice how much time had passed. One of my biggest concerns was with the over three-hour-long run time and thinking there were going to be scenes that could've been cut or shortened down and I was partially correct.For the most part, I never felt like the movie was dragging at all and was moving at a decent pace especially in the opening scene when we're being reintroduced to the characters and the Sully family. But I did start to feel the pacing issues once the sky people return and the family go to the Pandora reefs. Once at this point in the movie is when I started to find scenes that could've been cut down or cut out. What I find the funniest thing though about this movie is despite everything flowing well the ending for this movie was so rushed. The ending can be best described as don't blink or you'll miss it due to how fast it goes. But I think the real biggest reason you don't notice how much time has passed is due to the special effects in this movie. Despite how many years have passed since the first Avatar movie came out there's one thing everybody can agree on which is the special effects aged super well. I specifically love how if you compare the motion capture from the first movie to this one you can for sure see a difference in the CGI. From the Na'vi to the creatures of Pandora everything looks so much cleaner and natural. This is especially true when it comes to the look of the creatures of Pandora. By getting to properly explore the reefs of Pandora we get to see all new creatures that mainly inhabit the ocean and once again I'm asking how can I ride them. The Ilu, Skimwing and Tulkun are all well-designed creatures that look incredible. But it's not just the people or creatures that are jaw-dropping but the environment of Pandora as well. We've already seen what the forest of Pandora looks like so it's exciting getting to see this whole other area and how gorgeous it is. Every scene that's underwater is just breathtaking and makes you wish you could go and visit this place. Definitely a huge round of applause for every single special effects crew person for their hard work creating these underwater creatures, the environments and the Na'vi people. But of course, without actors in the Motion capture suits, none of this would work out.I can't say the acting in this movie was the best but what I will say is that all of the kids in this movie really stole the show. For most of the teenage actors in this movie, this was their very first big movie role and it really doesn't show. All of them are able to convey the proper emotion that's needed for the scene and make their character stand out amongst the others. For those who have siblings will be able to most likely relate to one of the Sulley siblings due to how well they demonstrate the different kinds of siblings everybody has or are. A person who was a surprise to me was Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, who plays Tuk, as I expected Tuk to be the cliche annoying little sibling but was actually fun to watch. I will say as the youngest I did relate to her the most but the other person I related to and really enjoyed watching was Lo'ak, portrayed by Britain Dalton. Out of all of the Sully kids, Lo'ak was honestly the most interesting to watch due in part to Britain Dalton's portrayal of this character. He conveyed perfectly this kid who's trying his best to fit in with the others in his family while still being true to himself. He always stands up for what he believes in and despite everything is always there for his siblings to protect them from anything. Despite not having that much screen time another actor who surprised me was Jack Champion. Like I said earlier Spider is such an interesting character study as he's human but raised among the Na'vi. I feel like with more screen time Jack Champion could really bring so much to his character and make him a fan favourite. I remember looking at the cast list and seeing that Sigourney Weaver, who plays Kiri, was coming back for this movie and was curious to see how. Well, Sigourney Weaver did an incredible job playing the teenage daughter of Grace. I know for the most part it was because of the CGI that she looked completely different but I still couldn't tell that it was her playing this character. I thought they brought in a young actress to do all of the motion capture and she just did the voice work but no.Sigourney Weaver actually played Kiri from the physicality to the vocals and you can tell she put in the effort. She comes across as a regular teenage actor from her voice to her body posture and conveys that emotion so well. I will quickly say that despite not having a lot of screen time Zoe Saldana was also pretty good. Every time Zoe Saldana was on screen you saw Neytiri's character growth over the past years and how becoming a mother has changed her. She's super supportive of her family and just wants what's best for them. She also just brings such raw emotion to this character as well that you're just hypnotized by her performance. Everybody else in this movie was also pretty good but due to many of them not getting much screen time they couldn't fully show off their acting ability. The last thing I want to mention is the editing in this movie because it was just weird. For the most part, the editing in this movie was just fine but there were a few occasions where the editing was just weird. There's this one scene where this one thing is happening and then it randomly cuts to something else not related for only a couple of seconds before cutting back to the original thing. It was during these few moments that I was taken out of the movie experience and decently confused. In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water surprised me but also proved me right by still having some issues with the story. But, this movie is definitely worth seeing at least once on whatever specialized screen your local theatre has just for the special effects alone. I'm curious to see what will happen in Avatar 3.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","niche-03437","14 December 2022","Visuals are again 10/10 but unfortunately that is where it ends.Sequal has none, and I mean none of the majesty and awe of thie first film and has relied on recycled junk.I can't imagine how they ever thought this would work let alone make sequals ready to go before simply testing the waters (pun intend) of part 2.After 13 years this film has made clear that the world has moved on from Avatar and the main character. I mean for the last 13 years Worthington has had bomb after bomb and has all but been forgotten, yet we're expected to be excited about his return? Literally everything that made the first film groundbreaking and breathtaking is absent from this film.Finally, let's not forget that Cameron, so sure of himself didn't think ""it's been a long time, lets just make a sequal and see what happens before making a third"". Instead thought ""I'm awesome, I'm going to make 4 sequels in a row all at once"". 🤣","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","AvionPrince16","14 December 2022","So lets be clear: the visuals of the movie are stunning (as expected) and even better with the 3D.its a visual experience really. It was amazing and the water have a nice simulation that make the experience even better. So now i am gonna talk something that i didnt enjoyed in the first movie and the second one: the story. I mean it have interesting points like family, love, war. But dont you think that the story is pretty classic? I mean we have also at the end the death of one son of the Jack family. But i found it pretty superficial and if Avatar 2 need that to make emotions its pretty sad. This is a Blockbuster and nothing is subtle: the fights, the animations, the visuals, the immersions are there but in the story i wanted something more subtle, more things to make us think or reflect some problems in society ( they talked about war so its pretty relevant in my opinion). But im not gonna lie that i was happy to see again the characters of the first movie and see how the vilain and the hero grown as a person. The colonel have no pity against Jake and want to make him pay for what he did in the first movie and thats still going on here. We find a Jake more careful, more human because he becomes a father and will make everything possible to make his family safe. And we will see that in the movie. The Battle against Jake and the colonel at the end was great. Now we will wait for the next movie to see what will happened to the kids of Jake family and the colonel family too. But i was really impressed by the visuals. Please go see the movie in 3D. It really worth to see.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Mollmull","7 June 2023","I couldn't get through the first 20 minutes without wanting to turn off my TV. The only reason I kept watching was to confirm my suspicion of this movie being awful, and, my suspicion was indeed confirmed.The beginning of this movie does nothing but confuse and bore you. Within the first 20 min you learn that grace's avatar somehow got pregnant?? (How this is possible when she quite literally died is beyond me) and any explanation given in the movie is null and void and takes away from the overall meaning of the story (will get to this later) and you also learn that Miles Quaritch aka the general somehow also ""survived"" and is back in the movie, after being shot with 2 arrows in the heart that, by his own quote ""will stop your heart in one minute"" the plot explains his ""reanimating"" by saying he and the other marines were in fact killed in their human bodies but they were transferred over to avatar bodies just like similarly to how sully was, which, as we saw in the first movie very complicated, and doesn't work if the spirit is too weak (as in graces case) AND unless their god allows it. But, despite this, somehow these marines all did it successfully.The fact they completely disregard these deaths in the movie and easily explain odd things that are impossible (grace being pregnant but also dead ??) it takes away the emotional impact. From this point on you don't trust that anyone is truly dead, you second guess everything because as James cameron has demonstrated, logic is out of the question with this movie, it goes against its OWN LORE.This movie also essentially is the first movie but slightly different, the overall plot is almost identical and to make it worse they use the same characters from the first as the main antagonists. It boils down to evil marine/american government/ scientists vs Jake sully and other natives fighting over, you guessed it, their land. The only main difference is they add new characters but the ""issues"" are the exact same. Way too cliche, way too predictable.Many reviews also say the script is awful but the movie is stunning, I personally think the movie looks no better than the first. It's pretty, yes, but for 90% of viewers the difference in cgi isn't different from the first, not to mention James cameron supposedly worked on this for 13 years, obviously ignoring the script entirely. The amount of bragging and hype behind this movie was NOT warranted, this is easily one of the worst, and frustrating movies I've ever watched and by far the worst James cameron movie I've ever seen and it's ""beauty"" doesn't make up for the other atrocities.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","achmoye","23 December 2022","Avatar 2 is an amazing experience in terms of visuals, the motion-capture is astounding, the environments of Pandora are exquisite.Well, except the framerate. Unbelievably enough, the framerate is not constant, going randomly from 24 to 48, and it gave me a headache. And I know exactly why. With something he called ""Truecut motion"", he wanted to avoid some ""soap opera effect"" so he kept the 48fps to action scenes...and that's puke for me. If you do 100% HFR like the Hobbit, you can get used to it. If framerate changes constantly, you just get nausea.Even with good visuals, that's not enough to make a movie.I cannot believe how much violence there is in this movie. On 3 hours long, there may be 1 hour of action, combat, destroying things, the colonel trying to take vengeance.The whole movie is about the colonel trying to take vengeance on Jake Sully because Jake decided on Avatar 1 to protect the planet, against his mission. So we end up with a very cliché story of vengeance with a bad guy that never dies, that we seen a million times already.It is beyond me that James Cameron went from Titanic to such a generic cowardly writing. Where is the debate about ecology ? Did ANYTHING evolved in terms of diplomacy ? I can't see any kind of resolution from Avatar 1 to 2. Nothing happened human-Na'vi wise. They just fight. I guess war is the only answer. Is that the real message you wanted to share, James Cameron ? How can we end up with such basic violence and no negociations ? Did you ever watch Star Trek, Goldorak ?There are some interesting stuff, like the meeting between Na'vi and water Na'vi, but that's it.Now, there are a bunch of things that I didn't understand. If humans can clone a mixed Na'vi-human DNA and put a consciousness in it...there can most certainly clone some whale substance to stop aging to millions of liters, right ?How does the Na'vi communicate with the whale ?Why the girl laughs when she see her brother fight ? Is that so funny ?Why on earth the Na'vi get pregnant because the scientists on earth love each other ?And what about stopping aging ? Is that really useful, in a world where you can just transfer your mind into another body ? Why no character thought about that ?What about Earth ? Did anything happened there ? Are there any medias, any people against the whole process ? Does the scientist have any feelings ? Did anyone evolve on Earth ? We have zero news about it. But we do have hours of hollywoodian fighting.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","mrfrodogetdown","14 December 2022","The film premiered today here in Finland, and as a fan of James Cameron, I went to see it immediately. The version I saw was 3D HFR from the best possible screen in Helsinki.When the first film came out in 2009, I was sure 3D was going to be the future of cinema. Even with it's poor storyline, Avatar was quite good film in my opinion. However, as it turns out, 3D films have been thing of the past for few years. Peter Jackson's The Hobbit -films tried something new with high frame rate. While I liked HFR 10 years ago, I haven't seen any HFR films since. So I can't be the only one thinking if 3D HFR is not being appreciated these days by audiences?Visually Avatar: The Way of Water looks stunning. The effects are unbelievable, especially underwater scenes. HFR works a lot better than it ever worked on The Hobbit films. 3D is amazing, as it was in the first film. 3D is in fact so good I hope it comes to fashion again. This film is without a doubt a technical milestone in moviemaking. I just wish the movie would be good too.It's been 13 years since the first movie came out. James Cameron had more than ten years to perfect the script. There were five people credited for making the story of the film, and of those five, three were credited for screenplay. You would think that in such a long time so many people could figure out how to make a film without script being a big pile of crap.What follows are small spoilers, so be warned.This film's story is basically the same one as the first movie. How it it so is beyond me, as the first film was also blamed for poor script. Basic storyline is that the bad skypeople are a threat, the na'vi cry a bit for their animals, nature and Eywa and in the end they fight the bad skypeople. In between the film is basically about some na'vi kids swimming in the sea, chilling with the whales.In the first film skypeople were in Pandora to mine some metal, now what they are after is basically whale brains that stops humans from aging. That's cool, but since that was told, it wasn't relevant to the story. I would've liked to see some rich guy getting his whale-brain-juice to stop himself aging. A character like that could've made a good villain. Now the villain is the same Quaritch guy as in the first film. A villain so mediocre is maybe not a good thing trying to make what, 3-4 films?The movie lasts over 3 hours. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the few people who do not mind seeing a long movie. But for that, movie has to have a good script. The script is just poor, and the movie is filled with long, beautifully shot scenes of na'vi kids exploring Pandora's sealife. You don't care for any of the characters, and Jake Sully feels like a side character. James Cameron has wanted to make a film that is a technical marvel. It's sadly only thing what this film is. What he should have done is to cut 30-45 minutes of the films lenght to save the film. Now it's just too long movie that feels like a very well animated video game story animation.The film itself is in my opinion 4/10 stars. Technically it's 10+/10, so for just that, you should see it in theaters, especially in 3D HFR.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","GusherPop","17 December 2022","James Cameron's long-awaited sequel to 2009 ""Avatar"" arrives in theaters this weekend and it has critics captivated and exasperated. Disney's ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" which clocks in at over three hours long, is being hailed as a stunning piece of cinema, generating a ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. ""The Way of Water"" follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who are now the parents of four Na'vi children. The family is driven from their forest home when humans return to re-colonize parts of Pandora. Way back in 2009, ""Avatar"" arrived on screens as a plausible and exciting vision of the movie future. Thirteen years later, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" - the first of several long-awaited sequels directed by James Cameron - brings with it a ripple of nostalgia. Jake and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) are raising a brood of biological and adopted children, whose squabbles and adventures bring a youthful energy to the sometimes heavy, myth-laden narrative. Cameron's embrace of the idealism of adolescence, of the capacity for moral outrage as well as wonder, is the emotional heart of the movie. You feel it in a horrifying scene of tulkun slaughter that aspires to the awful, stirring sublimity of the last chapters of ""Moby-Dick,"" and also in the restlessness of Lo'ak, Spider and Kiri as they try to figure out their roles. Although Cameron's sequel is highly anticipated, it's not necessarily parallel to the rabid Marvel and Star Wars franchise fans who flock to the earliest-possible showings. ""Titanic"" (1997) and ""Avatar"" (2009) both opened on this weekend, in different eras of preview shows. ""Avatar"" grossed the equivalent of $5 million (adjusted) in midnight shows only. Neither film had an opening that conveyed their ultimate success, but this was due in part to the more-limited theater capacities of the period. ""Titanic"" ultimately grossed 22 times its opening weekend; ""Avatar,"" 10 times. That record makes any definitive response to the preview numbers more difficult. Quaritch is joined by some deadly human fighters too, and Avatar: The Way of Water encourages us - successfully - to root against humanity for all the destruction it's unleashed on the world. We've seen that before, including in the first Avatar, but it speaks to Cameron's real achievement, which is to bring us into total identification with these computer-generated Na'vi characters.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","shiftshaper-50803","8 May 2023","I'll start off with the positive. This movie is visually stunning. The graphics while far from perfect, are spectacular nonetheless. The three stars that I gave this movie is for that reason, and that reason alone. Seriously, great visuals.Now it's time for the hard truth. This movie was NOT good. Not even a little bit. Recycled story lines, recycled rivalries, recycled trials and tribulations. It was like watching the first movie all over again, except this time it was done in an alternate universe where everything felt less than the first movie. Don't get me started on that human kid spyder. What the heck was that? His character is so cringe inducing, that I couldn't even stomach a second viewing of the movie when I tried to watch it to see if my opinion could be swayed. It was horribly bad. If this is the direction the Avatar franchise is heading towards, I'm afraid they're dead in the water. They won't get away with mediocrity in the third film like they did with this one. The anticipation for this movie was so high, and it falls short by a long mile. Extremely disappointed with this sequel. All flash and awe, zero substance and captivating story.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","bulgerpaul","18 December 2022","It's nice to see that 25 years after Titanic, there is still no director more capable of capturing and framing the sheer scale and weight of a colossal structure sinking into water in heart pumping, exhilarating mini-sequences than James Cameron, as this film recreates that final 40 minutes of Titanic once again on a much grander scale, except the the added bonus of being set on an alien planet in an ocean filled with sea-monsters.Now, with this long anticipated sequel finally here, I'm once again seeing the same exact criticisms of the first film resurfacing to describe this film, chiefly, ""nice visuals bad story,"" and I've already addressed that tired criticism in my recent revisiting and reappraisal of the first Avatar movie. It's become very popular to criticize the first film for neglecting the fundamentals of character and story structure in service of its aesthetic, a criticism I've come to find unfounded 13 years later, mostly because it seems that people have been conflating ""simple"" and ""bad."" Avatar's characterization is intentionally simple, it is not bad. Obviously Cameron is relying on extremely broad, instantly recognizable archetypes so that its audience can immediately understand the gist of who's who within minutes of screen-time, because Cameron's primary goal is to jump straight into discovery and world building, the very thing that made the first film such a magical and unique experience, which is why he got away with a 20 minute first act and a 100 minute long second act. And people were so quick to jump to the conclusion that the simplicity of the characterization in the first film was a product of ineptitude or neglect, rather than the entire intention, that they missed out on the frequently genuinely funny character interplay and the lovely bits of characters' personalities spritz throughout (seriously did nobody pay any attention at all to the jubilation in Jake's face after getting to walk for the first time in years?) This all goes without even mentioning how solid the original screenplay was, with loads of setup and payoff, as people also like to criticize the first film for its ""weak writing,"" as they are mistaking weak writing for cheesy dialogue, two distinct things that are not synonymous with one another.With all of that out of the way, how does this film measure up to its predecessor? That's a stupid rhetorical question, as you can see from my rating, they're almost on equal footing. I adored every minute of my re-entry into this world. I'm overjoyed I've gotten to re-experience it once again anew at an age where I can finally fully appreciate it. I'm grateful Cameron has managed to (mostly) successfully recreate that same joy in discovery, and that his primary focus of efficiently expediting characterization and setup in favor of jumping straight into exploration and world building has remained (mostly) unchanged after 13 years.Before seeing this movie, I saw an unverified rumor being circulated that James Cameron originally handed in a 9 hour cut of the film to the studios and wanted the VFX team to visualize all of it before he was willing to begin cutting it down. At first glance I immediately brushed this unverified rumor off as a joke (though secretly hoping it to be true, if only for the memes), but at this point, I 100% believe that rumor as the gospel truth and nobody can convince me otherwise. Just so you can understand what I mean, in the first act of this film (which is about 50 minutes now, instead of the condensed 20 minutes of its predecessor), we get three separate retconned storylines added in as events that happened concurrently with the first movie in order to acclimate us to returning characters and explain the existence of two new characters, and a total of eight new main characters are added to the cast, introduced, given screen time and introductions and setup with their own distinct personalities to setup what functional roles they're going to be given throughout the rest of the story, all of whom are going to be tracked as they (along with the returning characters) begin splintering off into sub-groups during the conflicts that arise in the second and third acts. So the fact that all of this plot and all of this characterization is crammed in, as well as an almost comprable amount of world building with even more action beats than the first movie, all manages to fit inside only a three hour runtime is an astonishing feat, and I eagerly await that 9 hour cut (or whatever extended version we eventually get out of this film in the future, as that extra 20 minutes of content in the first's extended edition proved to be extremely valuable) to further flesh out these characters and this world.That being said, as much as people love to criticize the first movie for being light on plot, I hope those people come to realize that they should be careful what they wish for, because this movie absolutely does provide more plot (waaaaaaay more plot). Now I'm going to do some spoilers so if you don't want to know anything about this film before going in (why are you even reading reviews this far in?), then stop reading now because I feel the need to add just how much they manage to fit into this movie:Grace's avatar body was apparently impregnated before her death and her daughter has a mystical connection to plants with many questions remaining to answer.-The villain from the first film returns to life in an Avatar body and is seeking revenge. Oh and also he had a son who was left behind in Pandora who's basically been raised by some scientists and by Jake's Na'vi family and the two of them are given an entire contentious dynamic between familial bonds, mutual resentment for being on opposite sides of the conflict, as well as a mutual desire to connect with one another in spite of their opposition. Oh and also again, this kid has an unspoken interspecial romance with one of Jake's kids and Neytiri also habors some resentments against him which fester in a viscious third act turn. (yeah, all of the plot surrounding this one kid alone is downright LOADED)
-Jake and Neytiri had four kids since we last saw them, and yes, every single one of them are named, given personalities, plot functions, and are individually tracked throughout the action heavy third act -The entire family is uprooted and sent to live with island tribes, and yes, multiple members of the island tribes are given names, personalities, functions in the plot, and are tracked throughout the action heavy third acts.-there's an entire new plot thread introduced regarding plans to colonize Pandora to be suitable for human civilization
-an entirely new resource is discovered on Pandora in order to bring venture capitalism into the oceans with a sub-plot focused around whaling (which adds themes of animal cruelty to the pre-existing anti-colonial, anti-capitalist themes holding over from the first film).And this is all just what I can immediately recall from a single viewing, which I hope has done something to impress upon you exactly how much is going on in this movie in between the real reasons we are all here, for discovery and action, which it pulls off astonishingly well, and if I have even just one complaint this time around, it's that I wish it had gone just as light on plot this time as the first time around, because the segments of this film dedicated to discovery and exploration (which 100 minutes of the first film are dedicated toward) are nothing short of breathtaking. This underwater motion capture tech is on full display in all of its glory and every single underwater scene is bloody magical. I visibly smiled and audibly gasped multiple times, so much so that I wish that they had tacked at least another 30 minutes of non-plot non-action related runtime just to soak (pun intended) this new piece of the world in. As much time as we're given to swim with the creatures in this vast, vibrant ocean, I just desperately wanted more of it before we got into the action heavy final act, which of course, is an absolutely spectacular sequence in which James Cameron flexes for us, for the third time in a row, that not a single working director possesses his ability to setup the kind of heavy, weighted, mind boggling scale that he's done twice now since Titanic.I don't know what the reception of this movie is going to look like several years down the road, whether it will become subject to the same backlash in spite of its achievements, whether it will be doomed to suffer the same cliched, overly tired criticisms that it neglects proper storytelling and characterization, just as the first, but I really hope it's able to rise above that general perception. Either way, I've adored my return trip to Pandora, and I really hope to not wait another 13 years before before I get to go back again.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","JulesAndVincent6","23 January 2024","I'll be completely honest, I'm not a fan of the original Avatar (2009). Taking away its special effects, the story did not seem attractive to me at any time and I think that the conflicts shown are very typical.With the Academy Awards ceremony I put this sequel on my watchlist. What can I say? I think there was an improvement in many aspects and despite its length, for most of the film I enjoyed it. The CGI is completely hypnotic, as is everything seen on screen.Regarding the script and the development of the characters, I find myself in the same position as the original film. The same trite conflicts that we have seen countless times in other films, the holes to force more and more films in the saga (we will know that there will be at least 5). In general terms, the story captivated me a little more than the original film but my feelings are the same. I give this sequel an extra point, because the visual effects alone carry the 192 minutes of film, but James Cameron needs to keep improving if he wants to keep his audience for 3 more sequels.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","lord0faiiusion","18 December 2022","James Cameron is easily the most ambitious film maker in the business with the knowledge and credibility to do literally whatever he wants. Nowhere is this more evident than the mammoth Avatar sequel. He pulls off yet another visually stunning film that feels real, but the indulgence of the studio and no one to say no to him create some unfortunate flaws.The humans are almost universally cartoonishly evil. When they come back to Pandora, their ships essentially nuke a majority of the setting of the last film. They cruelly hunt whale analogues, specifically hunting females with calfs, all while knowing explicitly that they are intelligent, emotional alien species.Cameron's biggest issue though is the cast. There are about 10 or so main characters in this movie, and Cameron tries to give all but two a complete, separate, story arc of their own. Several times it feels like 3 movies were actually spliced and intercut together because there are so many threads being handled at the same time, but to his credit, they all come together exceptionally well in the climax and are all fairly satisfyingly and efficiently resolved.So while it is fashionable to hate on everything that anyone ambitious tries to do right now, and try and root for everything popular to fail, I think Way of Water is a very interesting experience which should be seen in 3D at the theatre as the director intended. Because, while the film is by no means perfect, when someone tells you they built their own rocket to Mars in the back yard, people should gather to watch the launch because succeed or fail, it is going to be worth the price of admission.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","notkingsoup","18 December 2022","13 years for the same exact movie is INSANE. Avatar: The Way of Water was supposed to be a highly anticipated sequel but ends up falling short of its expectations. Visually the movie is stunning. Zero Complaints there. The introduction to new characters seemed like it would take the film itself over the top. Boy was I wrong!The movie has very little to do with the ""Way of Water"" as projected in the title. Yes a lot of the movie is spent in the water but there's nothing that ties the water avatars to the plot other than the fact that Jake and his family are seeking refuge. Once that's been established it's literally Avatar 1 all over again. They learn the way of the natives, a major loss occurs and then it's war. A simple plot with a bunch of scenes that don't really add to the quality of the film if you're looking for a great story.Dead characters were brought back as avatars and did not capitalize off of the opportunity. The motive was to infiltrate the community to apprehend Jake & they had the perfect tools to make it a disguise/reveal moment but chose to have the Enemy Avatars act just like their human forms. A complete waste of an antagonist. I was very unimpressed with the direction they choseOverall it's a beautiful movie. The plot is very lazy. Feels very copy and pasted. If you've never seen the first one....you can watch this one and probably think it's the greatest thing ever. For those who have seen the first one...This AINT IT.","

They do that.Humans attack a whale-like creature for its brain blubber. Which is now the reason why humans came back because that substance is able to keep bodies without aging, and it's worth 80 million per kill.(apparently Cameron doesn't know how long space travel takes, nor does he know how much the cost to send things to and back from another planet)The hunters put a tracker on a whale which means they are the next to be killed. Navi kids try to take the tracker off, and get captured.Jake sully brings an army, but main baddy says he's going to kill kids if he doesn't surrender himself. Jake is going to do it, but whale that was saved attacks human boat.Big fight. Lots of humans die. One of jake's children dies. Big baddy almost dies but one of the other kids secretly saves him.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jp_91","15 December 2022","""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a film of tremendous quality, James Cameron directed and co-wrote this story with social criticism and quite human, something that he had presented before, but he always does it from a different and profound perspective. The cinematography is wonderful, mainly in underwater scenes, achieving powerful and beautiful visuals. The special effects are good, although in a couple of scenes they can look a bit unreal. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the action and suspense scenes. The greatest success is the script, as I mentioned before, it focuses on a story that deals with the problems of planet Earth but seen from the fictional Pandora, the human destroying everything in its path and what is different. Once you've walked out of the movie theater, remember ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and its message, drop the cants about it making you cry during its run on screen but out there you're back to being a person who treats your family badly or a neighbor. Do not belittle an animal either. The film's message is clear, live it in the cinema and in your daily life. Also remember that the plot of the film revolves around adapting and knowing good things around you but which you were unaware of or feared. A great movie and a possible winner of several Academy Awards next year.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jebyvyson","17 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually eye-popping film I've seen in a while. It is one of those movies to ACTUALLY experience on the big screen in 3D, like you're in another world. James Cameron has pushed the limits of technology in cinema once again to seek his vision. There is a lot more action in this movie than the previous film, a lot of new characters introduced, and a lot of BLUE in this film. The story is very simple, more cliche- like, which I was a little disappointed by hoping we get something more original. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie for what it is. One thing that frustrated me was this human character that can't decide what side he's on and it goes on like for the whole movie. Hopefully Cameron do better with his character in the next film, but other than that, I give this movie a watch if you're into the same stories you heard before looking drop dead gorgeous.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Vic_max","22 December 2022","Cameron has been hugely successful with epic storytelling - that includes spectacular world-building, memorable characters and a captivating adventure that takes you on a ride.While this movie was good, it wasn't in the same league as his previous ones. In fact, it felt more like an episode than an epic.Basically we get a familiar world (albeit a water location), unremarkable characters and a familiar enemy & plot. I didn't feel like I'd want to sit through the same movie again at the theater anytime soon (unlike my reactions to the first ""Avatar"" and Titanic).Even so - the wonderful aquatic visuals for for most of the 3+ hours created an ""experience"" of sorts. It let me let off my feeling that the intro was a bit rushed with the character introductions and explanations (esp. The kids).I hope Cameron is able to recapture his ""epic"" moviemaking style in Avatar 3. He's a great movie-maker and I still plan on getting tickets for the sequels.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Riles123","26 January 2023","The original movie was very fulfilling spiritually. It wasn't perfect, but it had heart.This movie isn't half as profound. The visuals are stunning -- we all know that. But the plot is so lackluster it is almost laughable. I'm so done with Hollywood creating these huge blockbuster films with absolutely nothing deep for the audience to grab onto. Apparently we are supposed to forgo the desire to be sincerely impacted by film (or simply not notice because of the insane CGI).For one thing, Miles Quaritch's return is almost ridiculous. We didn't need to see him again. He died in the first film, and they should have left it there. In truth, there are probably very few plotlines that could have made his return seem genuinely congruent with the story as a whole, and this wasn't it. The fact that he just has to come back and kill Jake Sully, and Jake Sully alone, to the exclusion of doing anything to actually further his crew's mission, is poorly explained at best. Why Jake Sully when he has left his people entirely exposed in the forest? Without Sully's aid and knowledge of the ""Sky People"", they might be easy to subdue.Along with the other apparently heartless, one-dimensional humans still involved in this tireless, war torn endeavor (which I guess is now about finding a place for human civilization to relocate once Earth is uninhabitable, yet this motive is only mentioned once!), Quaritch lacks a true character arch. In the beginning of the movie, once it is acknowledged that Spider is his son (although not really, because the Quaritch in this film is just a clone of the original... As the new Quaritch poorly explains to Spider once he is captured), I figured he would have the opportunity to grow. Surely his son (whose not really his son) would help him do that. While it's true that this kind of happens, his development is poorly fleshed out -- like everything else in this movie. Further, much of Avatar 2 depends on the dubious advancement of technology, to the point of absurdity.Speaking of Spider, I really stopped feeling one with the characters of this film when Neytiri pulled a knife on him. I have plenty of understanding for downtrodden, heart-broken individuals who do messed up stuff in a time of extreme pain, but this pushes the limit, and there is literally no resolution to it! The entire film emphasizes the value of family sticking together, and although Spider isn't technically a part of the family, he might as well be... Neytiri's treatment of him was so disappointing given the insight, wisdom, and sense of self-control she displayed in the first film. This was just totally out of character... it didn't seem right. She could have just snuck up on Quaritch when he had Kiri anyway (there were plenty of other far more fantastical moments). Or Spider could have done so beforehand, when Quaritch was truly vulnerable, instead of trying to reason with him. At the end of the movie, Jake echoes Neytiri when he says ""a son for a son""... Is that supposed to be some sort of resolution to Neytiri's behavior?In short, Avatar 2 is chaotic and disjointed. Very few subplots are fleshed out and carried the whole way through the film. The result is something special effect ridden, but jaded and confusing, not very impactful on a heart level, and very lacking in all of the depth and profundity of the first film. It's worth seeing if you loved the original Avatar, but you'll probably be disappointed.","

Last hour or so was a little more intertaining... at a point when the sea-Avatars were winding up for battle, they did the Haka face, I was so close to leaving the theatre. What a cliche. I hope James Cameron will concentrate more on the story in his next movie, than using a lot of money on visual effects. You can't make a good movie without a good story.

There's no culture left in this film, it's so americanised. It makes so little sense. The story, and I use that term in the loosest possible way, it's just a 3hr set-up for other films that is a waste of time and money, frankly. I really tried to care about the characters but they're so flat and cartoonish that I literally had no empathy for any of them, and I cry at adverts you can imagine how low the bar is for me. I know people are at least impressed with the visuals but I wasn't, it was too much, too over-the-top.

The underwater motion capture is the candle light.I'm a big fan of Cameron and always marveled that I could pick a random scene from his movies and be entertained.This one: no. It feels like a tired retread and nearly the same plot as the first one.In a broader sense, there are way too many characters for a 7 hour movie. The rivalry between the teens should have been cut to the bone.The Spider/Quarrich story was really the most interesting angle here, yet it seemed to be cut to nothing.I always have admired Cameron vs Lucas because it always seemed he was striving to make new great stuff. If it were Lucas, we would have no new movies after the Terminators. Lucas would have remastered the original Terminator to get rid of the painful stop motion.This one...

"Avatar: The Way of Water","sonshineboy","20 December 2022","Alfred Hitchcock famously said ""To make a great film you need three things: the script, the script and the script.""
I am convinced that James didn't have a Shooting script. He just turned on the camera, filmed a few motion captures, then put in an insane amount of CGI.The characters are devoid of emotion, motive, and charisma, giving them all the same personality as a plank of wood. They are empty vessels for James to use as a megaphone to spread his environmental concerns. Honestly, why not just make a documentary like blue planet and call it a day, or a dozen years in his case. Why waste so much of his and the audience's time and money to say the same thing that's been said multiple times in a much better way(Wall-E).The story is simple and predictable yet still could've worked had the runtime been shorter, like a lot shorter - you could cut an hour and a half of this and it wouldn't make the slightest difference in terms of continuity. Scenes that should have ended kept going on for minutes. And some of the sub plots are of the same quality as a soap opera.And at last, The Dialogue. Movies these days don't seem to care about good dialogue, and sadly the audience don't seem to care about it either. A dialogue should firstly and most importantly be interesting. Exposition and escalation (driving the plot forward) are useless instruments if the audience isn't invested in what the characters are saying. The whole movie feels like it was written by a pretentious art student who has no knowledge of how interactive speaking works. It also doesn't help that the actors are terrible, delivering each line without emotion or charisma. They all sound like characters from a very bad video game.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tiktoksweebs","17 December 2022","The first half of this review is spoiler free. The second half contains more detailed criticism of the film dealing with plot spoilers and the problems they create with the film. First off, the movie was absolutely visually stunning and worth the theater experience. Every frame could be a perfectly photorealistic image of the fantastical world of Pandora. The underwater scenes were positively spellbinding, and the new creatures and environments were captivating.That being said, the writing was it's downfall. To be fair, I was never bored per se because the visuals were so spectacular, but the movie had 3 hours of beautiful imagery and about 1.5 hours of actual story. It's basically a re-hash of the first movie, and promises another re-hash of the first movie in the third installment that has yet to come out. It resurrects the same villain from the first movie, with the same motivation, in the same setting, under near identical circumstances, and the same stakes.The worst part is that it could have been so much better. With such a high budget and such a long runtime you would think they could spend a few minutes showing/explaining why humans came back to Pandora. Cameron could have shown a few minutes of the current state of planet Earth and the people living there, as well as the people behind the exploration of Pandora. Instead we just get a few nebulous lines of throwaway dialogue. There are so many unexplored ideas in a world where the storytelling possibilities are endless. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either. The incredible visuals didn't make up for the bad story, they only distracted from it.(SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!)One thing that Cameron has never explained is why the military is even involved in the first place. The mining and exploration of the planet is purely corporate in nature, so why is a national defense force involved instead of mercenaries and private security? In the film, it is explained that the operations conducted there are no longer paid for by mining for the previous film's McGuffin ""Unobtainium"", but is now funded by the collection of Pandoran whale oil that stops the human aging process. No explanation, no visual backstory, just one line of dialogue from a tertiary character about 2/3 of the way through the movie.Another thing that is glossed over is the fact that apparently the Na'vi can breath oxygen for hours without any negative results, despite the fact that Pandoran air is toxic to humans. Why this is the case is never explored or explained either. Something else that is never explored or explained is the ""immaculate conception"" of Dr Grace Augustine's daughter, Kiri, or her ability to control the wildlife around her like she was (no pun intended) an avatar of Eywa. Yet another thing that is revealed and then left to the imagination is the fact that now the Na'vi can straight up talk to some animals, whereas the previous movie portrayed it (I think) in a much more beautiful and subtle emotional connection. Speech just feels muddy and out of place.Another missed opportunity is the fact that Spider/Miles is Quaritch's son. They share a few minutes of screentime with one another, and Quaritch even protects Spider on multiple occasions, including saving his life (a favor Spider returns toward the end of the movie). However, it's never explained why this Quaritch even cares about Spider, considering he never knew him or raised him. It would've behooved the story to show Quaritch in a flashback with Spider's mother or with Spider as a baby. It would've humanized and built on Quaritch's character beyond big bad military man.Finally, the movie puts forth the idea that apparently humans now no longer just want to strip Pandora for it's natural resources, but want to colonize Pandora because Earth is so badly damaged. Yup. That's right. Apparently, in a reality where humans can traverse the cosmos freely, the ONLY place in the known universe that humans can colonize is the one with with an atmosphere that kills humans in seconds and does not support any Earth life at all. Why? Don't know. I'm sure we'll find out in Avatars 5-8 twenty years from now.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","nightringer-76840","11 June 2023","Avatar was and always is James Cameron's philosophical movie. The first one was incredibly new and dramatic. Way of Water felt empty for me, despite ofthe exploration of new side of Avatar's world. I felt the story was forced in, trying to be wise without an argument. I understand that this sequel takes a long time to develop and made into a movie. The box office said it is a successful sequel. I do hope the next installation would be better.Visually, Way of Water showed advancement of SFX far beyond the original. I could see facial details of emotional reaction clearer and enabled the actors to showcase expressive acting through their exaggerated facial movements and expressive voice. Technology-wise, Way of Water should win an Oscar.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","wsaghir","15 July 2023","The first Avatar was lousy with only nice visuals going for it if CGI graphics is something that tickles your fancy. No way in hell was it a movie that deserved to surpass Titanic which was Cameron's last good movie but the marketing hype mad it so apparently.This Avatar was even worse. The story line was predictable, bland, and unoriginal. The CGI was not something worth seeing after the first one. Like the first one which rode off the coat tails of Cameron's prior box office successes, this one seemed to use the same marketing hype at the expense of actually being good.Definitely will be the last Avatar I see as it seems to join the bevy of other productions that seems to provide no substance yet draws ticket sales through hype and theatrics.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","linusmarhold","14 December 2022","The movie was great IMO. Some lower ratings will be expected since it wasn't as action packed as the first one and the main plot isn't anything mind-blowing. However I think this was an amazing experience. The visuals were truly stunning and mesmerizing. I'd say 99% of the effects in this movie were unbelievably good and where there were some few scenes that could've looked better, those scenes still looked as good (if not even better) than most other block buster movies like the MCU. Story wise I believe it was simple, but definitely not bad. The movie focuses more on developing the characters bond with each other and their own individual progress. The movie wasn't as action packed and grand as the first Avatar, which is to be expected since there's 3 more films to follow now. The 3+ hour run time felt like it flew past and as the movie was concluding I actually wished it was longer just cause how amazingly well done the effects were, especially the underwater scenes.The movie definitely lived up to all of my expectations after the first movie, which basically were: even more incredible visual effects, cool action scenes and a good story.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","simianfriday","5 April 2023","Avatar: The Way of Water is an impressively large and extraordinarily long film. Set many years after the original, the film follows the continuing lives of Jake Sully and Neytiri - now with a family consisting of several teenage Na'vi children (with the film focusing on the children for much of its runtime). When marines return to Pandora seeking revenge, the couple must flee from their jungle home to the shores of a coastal tribe. There, they must learn to adapt to their new home, overcoming conflicts within their new tribe, as well as Colonel Miles Quaritch (now cloned and in an Avatar body) who is hunting for them in a relentless quest for revenge.Avatar 2's effects are excellent, most of the CGI is beautifully rendered and necessary for the film's sweeping camerawork and scope. It's so good, in fact, that it's easy to forget almost nothing you're seeing on screen at any given moment is real. Unfortunately, many of the underlying failures of this sort of CGI remain: the characters and objects often appear weightless, leading to moments where the physics of what's happening lands firmly in the uncanny valley - even if the aesthetics are often breathtaking.In 2009, the ambition of rendering the majority of a live action film in a computer (one which looked magnitudes more convincing than even the most impressive CGI of the time) was daring enough to justify a tradeoff in verisimilitude. The first film became the highest grossing film of all time because audiences had never seen such expansive use of CGI. Now, though? It's all they know. While they might be cheaper, and not as gorgeously rendered or intricately detailed, Marvel movies - just as colorful, creative, expansive, and busy - are so popular and ubiquitous that the novelty of these massive CGI spectacles is long dead.Given how the industry has changed over the past dozen+ years, and the massive gap between the two films, one might assume Cameron would dedicate considerable time, energy, and attention to his script - he has not. Motivations, character development, and structure are all laughably thin. Despite it's 195-minute runtime, the film is largely uneventful - the main characters haven't grown or changed in any meaningful way by the end of the story, and the motivations of the antagonists are entirely contrived, making precisely zero sense.Filling the void between action spectacles is what some might try to call ""character work"" mostly centering around the children of protagonists, Jake and Neytiri. The children are viewed as outsiders to the new tribe and are challenged to fit in, a plotline which derivatively borrows from the first film, itself an already-tired Dances with Wolves retread.The dialogue is a significant issue here - it's laughably blunt, a cringe-worthy mix of direct verbalizations of feelings, and irrelevant, throwaway banter, all obviously written by a 68 year old with a distant, bland memory of what being a child is like. Cameron seems to think all it takes to depict a teenager is to have them say ""bro"" and ""cuz"" in every sentence, while getting into lots of absolutely senseless fights with some of the most cliche bullies ever put to film and always, *ALWAYS* doing the opposite of whatever they're told.The performances are... fine, I guess. There are very few scenes featuring real humans in the entire film, so the CGI and motion capture is forced to do all the heavy lifting. Actors become voice actors, and only Zoe Saldana musters any genuine emotion - though she is sadly in very few scenes, serving as little more than a background character for the majority of the film (as are almost all of the women, to be honest, appearing to exist on the world of Pandora only to bare children - sometimes even after death).The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense... Quaritch is cloned into an Avatar body (in the first of *many* absurd contrivances in this movie) and embarks on a mission of revenge against Jake Sully. This could be ok as a simple way to kick off the plot - but it never develops beyond this and it doesn't even make any sense because this isn't a *personal* mission of revenge - he's literally given orders to go after Jake, as if the entire Earth military presence is there on Pandora *ONLY* to go after Jake. Quaritch seemingly has no other purpose for being there.This also introduces problems for the plot when viewed in the context of the first film. The entire reason Jake Sully was recruited by the military in the first place is because they made an Avatar body for his twin brother and when his twin brother was killed the Avatar would have been useless had it not been for Jake. But now we're told they have the capability to not only clone people and Avatar bodies, but also download and save those people's memories to be uploaded into the cloned bodies. Why they didn't just do this with Jake's brother is a question left unanswered.Speaking of plot problems introduced by this movie... the goal of the humans in the first movie was to acquire ""unobtainium"" which goes entirely unmentioned in the sequel. This is yet another absurd contrivance because it means we can conveniently forget all about the jungle Na'vi and what they must be going through trying to defend themselves from the humans who would no doubt be resuming attacks on their home in order to obtain more ""unobtainium."" But because Cameron wants to show his cool new water special effects, he doesn't want us thinking about the tired old jungle he's leaving behind and he knows he can't do that if we're reminded of the giant ""unobtainium"" repository underneath the burnt remains of the Na'vi home tree.About halfway into the film, we're introduced to another, similar MacGuffin, when the whalers (who don't even appear to be a part of the military at all) extract some kind of glowing golden goo out of one of the whale-like Tulkun. We're told this goo is capable of completely halting aging in humans. One might immediately wonder why this is so valuable though, given humans can apparently have all their memories downloaded into a clone - effectively making them immortal - but Cameron doesn't linger long enough for the audience to ask tough questions because this is never mentioned again and has no real bearing on the plot at all. It's *probably* setup for one of the sequels, but nobody has any reason to care at this point. The only reason this appears to be included in the movie at all is to give the humans an excuse to be at sea, attacking the water Na'vi tribes.This is already getting ridiculously long so I'll just rapid-fire a few thoughts here...The children are captured *THREE TIMES* in this movie. So much so that one of them even comments about it, exasperatedly saying she can't believe she's been captured again.The final battle is ridiculously absurd on multiple levels but the most significant issue with it is that the water Na'vi just *disappear* halfway through the battle so it's just Jake and his family (along with the daughter of the leader of the water Na'vi - which was his entire reason for getting involved in the first place) left to fend for themselves.The outcast Tulkun was a really interesting idea that suffers from terrible execution. The water Na'vi treat him like a murderer because he fought back against humans who murdered his family. It felt like very cult-like rigid adherence to dogma and didn't sit right with me.There are also seemingly only three types of human in this movie: The Evil Military Grunt, The Evil Apathetic Capitalist Profiteer, and the Sympathetic Scientist who gives lip to their peers and maybe defects (but we won't know until we see them in a background shot of Avatar 3). No one resembling a real person. Only one-dimensional Saturday-morning cartoon characters. Oh, and Spider, I guess.Suffice to say, outside of the spectacle of the admittedly very impressive CGI, this movie is absolutely terrible.4/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Matt-Canalcon","14 December 2022","It's not without its issues but completely spectacular visually, Avatar: The Way Of Water is a fantastic welcome return to form for James Cameron with game-changing special effects and his sixth sense for entertainment that is shining on screen. It's not perfect but people are gonna love it. Fans of 2009's Avatar are going to be under a spell revisiting this world with the 13 years of technological advancement, Cameron was clearly hard at work behind the camera. The theme of the new sequels seems to be clear: it's about family.With the gap since the last movie it was important to recreate the magic of Pandora right from the start and the film does take you right back into it from the first scenes with amazing visuals: the colors are popping, the scenery is magnificent and similar to its predecessor, Way Of Water sets the bar very high for special effects in future blockbusters. You can trust James Cameron with rich world-building but also for directing action that feels realistic and this movie gives you one hell of a ride in terms of spectacle. At times Cameron is paying homage to its own movies and I was totally on board with that. It is an absolute achievement on a technical level without a doubt.I was able to see the film in IMAX 3D (HFR Experience in 48fps) and I'm going to get into a minor nitpick that doesn't affect my overall judgement of the film. I am not a fan of high-frame rate (60fps instead of the usual 24 frame per seconds), and the screening I saw had some shots going back-and-forth between 48fps and 24fps which was distracting for me at first. I doubt this will be an issue for most people, and this might actually not apply to every screenings as it's going to be showing in Regular 3D and 2D everywhere, but this is something that bothered me, I'm not going to lie. It's as if someone was turning the motion smoothing on and off as you're watching a scene. That is the only technical nitpick I would have to add and this is why I want to see it again this weekend to get a better judgement.I don't want to say too much about the story and the characters because Cameron is clearly building something big that everyone needs to experience by themselves on the biggest screen possible. I would also suggest rewatching Avatar before going into this new one. Will it have the same effect that the original Avatar had? I guess we're going to find out in a couple of days, but my guts tell me that the audiences worldwide are going to love this movie and this is only the beginning for this franchise. Sure, a lot of this movie felt like setup for the future, but it's absolutely gorgeous to look at and never boring. Welcome back Mr. Cameron, we missed you!8/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","numenorsniper-66396","16 December 2022","I just now saw this in 3D, and was completely immersed from start to finish. I smiled, laughed, cried, my heart raced, and my jaw was agape many times. It's the best cinematic experience I've had since the first Avatar (13 years ago!), maybe even surpassing it.I'll be seeing it in IMAX in a couple days, and any other screen style I can.Bravo to everyone involved with this masterpiece, it is a whole new step up in cinema, much in the way Lord of the Rings was for its time.Avatar: The Way of Water truly has a beautiful feel to it. The writing and story is superb, the casting and acting is stellar, and the theme of sacredness about nature and the ocean is woven into every frame of the film. The main element that really impressed me was how seamlessly the CGI melded with the real people interacting with Pandora and its inhabitants, making me completely forget that this gorgeous world we dive into isn't footage from Earth, despite me wanting it to be.I loved how the film takes its time with character development and letting the audience breathe in the beautiful world of Pandora, rather than rushing through everything (like how many other blockbusters do), and also not wasting a moment.I am really happy and excited that we're going to be getting at least 3 more Avatar movies after this, at least hopefully! It feels like we're back to an era of movies that I'm excited about again, after about a decade of drought. That being said, the movie's title is very fitting; an oasis in the expansive desert that modern media has long been.Update / Edit (Aug 30th 2023): (contains spoilers)After having watched it again on digital copy just now, I think this movie is specifically designed for IMAX 3D, and outside of that format much of its charm is lost. My first impression as written above was quite overzealous and rose-tinted, so here's some extra thoughts:Way of Water is a visual feast for sure, best theatre / IMAX 3D experience I've had since Avatar 1, but I still prefer the first one; the story is better, tighter script, and the best building tension to final battle in any movie I've seen. Also the second one didn't quite hit as hard as the first one did. Avatar 1 is perfect, endlessly rewatchable, not a wasted scene throughout. However it does feel that Way of Water could have done with tightening up some more, especially the plot and script, in order for it to pack an emotional punch similar to or greater than the first. The final battle of Water could have been much grander, involving the Metkayina throughout rather than just the start when they quickly disappear inexplicably. At least give an explanation of why they suddenly vanished, and why Neytiri was side-lined for much of it only to occasionally pop in when the story needed her to.Going forward in the Avatar series of movies, I hope James Cameron can refine the stories of each, and how they're told, to make us fall in love with Pandora like the first one did, as Way of Water didn't really do that for me. I hope that this film will be the weakest narratively of all the Avatar films, and the upcoming three will take the feeling that made so many of us fall in love with Avatar back in 2009/2010, and ramp it up.The rule of thumb however with most movie franchises is that the first one is the best, and the following ones aren't quite as a good or memorable. However, James Cameron has shown the world that he can make sequels better than their originals (Aliens, T2), so I hope that he still has that magic in him.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","markjholloway-60408","5 February 2023","As many others have said, the visuals and the imagination that went into the visuals is the best I have ever seen.The quality of them frankly just dominate the movie.The acting is good too.However, the story is just lazy, in my opinion, feeling like a shotgun appropriation of ideas central to American and Western culture.Want a little of the Vietnam War burning of villages there? Got it!A little of a Western vs American Indians with their arrows and war cries? Sure!A little military might and blind capitalism being mis-used to destroy traditional cultures and murder whales for economic gains? Done!Even a little New Zealand Maori tattoos and Haka? Just slip it in!All wrapped together in a neat parcel of David vs Goliath little guys beating the big guy.Maybe Cameron is showing us the most awful elements of Western culture, to shame us, or laugh at us? Or, maybe, he is just recycling familiar stories for us to pay for?Who know?","

Although the storyline was cliche and the script was amateur at times, the sum of all its parts (mainly the visuals) were able to create a fantastic experience where the viewer walked out happy.This movie tries to replicate the first and fails miserably. The story is almost the same, the acting is worse and the dialogue is embarrassing. There are more plot holes than I can explain, meaning the viewer is being punished for over three hours. And the fact that they pull the original cast back, even though two of them died in the first... come on.If you've watched the first and liked it, don't ruin it by watching this dribble. Cameron is just trying to get the money.","

Kiris daughter has a storyline that never really gets explored (in 3 friggen hours!!!!) and makes zero sense. There was zero creativity in this movie, wasn't everyone expecting insane alien ocean life?? It's a movie about humpback whales with more fins.

Visuals were breathtaking. The background score was also good and the one must see the behind the scene clips to better understand what goes behind creating such a epic movie. The script should have been little tighter without getting into unnecessary details. Avatar 2 should be felt and will be remembered for it's breathtaking CGI and graphics.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","katharineshowalter","14 December 2022","Beyond the bubblegum exterior, a powerful sentiment drives much of AVATAR 2's action. As Papa Smurf (Sam Worthington, who might be phoning it in; you can't tell because: CGI but also: Sam Worthington) muses from the start, Neytir's identity is rooted in how others perceive her, and she's never been given the opportunity to tell us who she is. Thus, Neytiri sets out to make a name for herself amid a sea of patriarchal social mores that dismiss her perspective.Along the way, Neytiri's quest teams her with a band of quirky companions, from Cliff Curtis's burly Tonowari, CCH Pounder's of course wise Mo'at, and Sigourney Weaver's American teen except for size Kiri. Even the vocal talents of Kate Winslet -- who sounds as if she'd rather be filming TITANIC 2 than cashing a check, here -- make an appearance in the role of, I think, Smurf Willow, but nothing can lift a drab sense of defeat bubbling under the gloss of Pandora's neon-plastered paint job.No matter how old-fashioned and doggedly colonial its inclinations are, it's still wrapped in a ridiculous package hand-delivered by cyan humanoids. Absurdity isn't always the mark of simplicity, however. Ambitious films like INSIDE OUT and THE MUPPET MOVIE (Gonzo!) prove sharp wit and blue characters don't have to be mutually exclusive. AVATAR 2 buckles under the pressure of the bar set by far superior titles that have come before it, skimping on narrative nuance in favor of a showy fireworks display that's bound to distract nondiscerning cheese eaters on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but might leave anyone with a brain blue in the face.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","isaiahwilson15","20 December 2022","James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time, I do not believe he has made a bad movie, and he keeps that streak alive with Avatar: Way of Water. He has once again reset the standard of what is possible with CGI, but should visuals alone be the sole factor in assessing this movie's greatness. Throughout the history of cinema, movies are evaluated on their presentation and story to put it simply.If Avatar 2 (To keep the wordcount down) gets a 100% A+ for visuals, then I have to be honest in giving it a solid B for its story. While I agree with Cameron's choice to keep the story simple in the first one to allow for more time to be spent word building. It in a lot of ways works to the detriment of this movie.Characters from Jake Sully to Neteyam & Lo'ak, the Sully sons, and numerous others just fill their typical archetypes. Protective father, rebel son, ""force-sensitive"" child, etc.It may seem harsh but the greatest franchises are almost always built on equally great characters whether it be via their backstory, motivations, or an actor/actresses performance.However maybe the movies greatest sin is committed with my two favorite characters from the first film being Neytiri & Colonel Quaritch. Neytiri is suspicious sidelined in this movie with really no arc or true impact to the story except for maybe the best scene of the movie in the final act. At the same time, Colonel Quaritch while having a lot more to do then Neytiri is booged down by a nonsensical backstory and no character growth except for the final act. I'll admit he fulfills the main purpose of a villain by being an intimidating threat, but when you're arc is basically a repeat of the previous movie....
The first thing I thought when I left this movie is what Corridor Crew (VFX React Channel) will have to say! Today studios for the most part have gotten stagnant with pushing the VFX envelope, and VFX artists are asked to create spectacle with minimal time. This movie shows firsthand when you have a vision, talent, and time what can be accomplished. The result are images that show exactly why I am a valued AMC Stubs member, and also why movie theatres aren't going anywhere anytime soon.Immense credit goes to James Cameron for knowing what he wants, having an idea of what he needs to shoot, and putting together a capable team. And despite his shortcomings in characters, his vision for fleshing out Pandora, its lore and other territories truly makes it feel like one of the most immersive fictional worlds since Star Wars.Credit and respect must also be given to Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and all of the other Na'vi character actors. Similar to voice acting, I believe it almost takes more talent to capture the human nuances in a digital character and that is achieved by each actress and actor though the same can't exactly be said for the human counterparts.As I'll reiterate, James Cameron has created another amazing film that improved upon its predecessor in the story where needed. I do have to ask the question, how far can this franchise go. I thought the 2nd movie would emphatically answer that a la Cameron's Aliens. Yet for the most part it hits most of the same beats as the first one and in conclusion, WOW essentially begins and ends with the visuals. Are 3 more movies that are essentially pretty to look at but not much else going to justify a billion dollar production price tag?We will see, but in the meantime I'll refuse to doubt Mr. Cameron.","

Each shot is filled with rich scenery and amazing details. It's been a long time since I've watched a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.But I won't say that the film is flawless. It lacked a good story and there were many logical loopholes. It's like the whole movie was made just to show the beautiful underwater scenes. The film suffers from poor character development too. While the first part had a meaning, I don't understand what Cameron is trying to convey through this film.But all these flaws are overshadowed by the visuals. If you're someone who watches films for the sake of entertainment, you would surely enjoy this film. But if you're someone who expects more than just entertainment, you will still enjoy it but won't feel fulfilled. Overall, it was worth the hype.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","ianrobertdavidson","17 December 2022","I have to say that I enjoyed this movie but it lacks the impact and originality of the original.The narrative repeats too many of the elements of the first movie. It suffered from being too similar to the original in look, characters, pacing, themes, dialogue and storyline. There were no new sci-fi elements and feeling that one was being intellectually challenged in any way whatsoever unlike the original.The new characters brought very little to the project. That said, it is way better than most blockbuster sequels and it certainly outshines the recent Marvel movie releases.mind you that isn't hard to do.Aspects of the narrative are stretched through the entire 3 hours of the movie and become tiresome.The movie is visually stunning and the action scenes have real tempo and intensity.At times it was hard to recognise who was who as many of the characters look too similar.I'm hoping for some real originality Avatar 3 and not a third helping of the same. If we get the latter I'll end up wishing that they only ever made one Avatar movie.","

Possibly the best movie I have ever seen visually. Here comes the but...But, where this movie excels visually, it has come up short in the story/plot. It just felt a bit repetitive and was too similar in a way to the first Avatar movie.It felt that James Cameron's main focus was on making a near perfect movie visually but has unfortunately had a negative impact on the plot. Overall, it gave the movie a real unbalanced feel to it so I hope for Avatar 3 he can bring a stronger story/plot which will make it more unpredictable and enjoyable.One final point I have to make. Why did they feel the need to have Sigourney Weaver play the voice of her daughter that is still a child? Everytime she spoke, it just didn't come across right at all. Why is a child talking like a 70 year old woman?! What benefit did they get from this seriously? What a strange decision. If you have a female child character then cast a child actress.

I haven't seen True Lies in a few years, and I haven't seen Titanic yet.What I can say is that I don't think this is a good movie, but I like it. Objectively speaking, it's not well-written. Probably because Cameron worked with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver who are hacks. (They helped write Jurassic World, which is garbage. And they wrote the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy, each entry of which is nowhere near as good as people think.) And the movie is an hour longer than it should be.The majority of the movie should've been in Na'vi. No, they wouldn't have to learn the language. Just say the lines as they're written, and annunciate. ""Oh, but people don't like reading subtitles."" Screw them. It would've made the movie better on an objective level. It would've made sense!But what keeps me from fully hating this movie are the special effects, the ambition, themes of family and sacrifice, the action scenes, the simple but effective storyline, sense of discovery, and some of the performances. Most of acting was pretty bad or just unspecial, but Kate Winslet, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Zoe Saldaña gave the best performances in the whole movie. Just like she did with the first one, Zoe Saldaña steals the show. Her acting is very energetic and expressive.The last hour of the movie kicks ass!Also, personal point, I have a special place in my heart for James Cameron's movies. They connect with me on a personal level. Sure, they can be really corny but I like his corniness. And for that reason, because I love the ocean and animals, as well as the positives that I have listed, I will watch this movie again. And I will buy it on Blu-ray to support the artists, and to watch the behind the scenes.I find it funny that he said he never wanted to do a movie like The Abyss ever again, yet years later he would make Titanic and then much later made this.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","stycz","21 December 2022","I don't get the reviews that say this movie is ""less than""... I LOVED IT. Every minute of it. Cameron took the time to develop relationships - between individuals, between tribes, between life forms. The visuals are stunning. What is the problem with ""light on story"". What part of good versus evil has to be expanded on? It's a basic and often times tragic problem that is explored on several levels. The interaction of people and wildlife was again delicately and beautifully done. I did not feel the length at all and could have sat through more. I had many questions that were left unanswered. So I guess that's maybe what I hope next installment will include.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","BabySharkDoDoDie","16 December 2022","Visually stunning, emotionally strong with great action & music that is what Avatar 2 for me. Finally the year is ending by this amazing film I was excited about.Strong characters, good storyline, epic visuals, amazing music, great message especially about nature, species & family ( & no this film will not give you any lecture on any of it so relax!) all in all a beautiful film directed by the master of cinema James Cameron.Especially the characters are all amazing & different loved all of them, my favourite one become Jake's younger son Lo'ak as I got really connected with him more & as for the antagonist you'll gonna hate him slowly which is a good thing.Recommended to watch it with your whole family for a better experience emotionally & they'll thank you as well as you'll thank them all.Overall a great cinematic experience. Thanks for each & everyone involved in this film.","

Only James Cameron can do this visual stunning Movie. This high frame rate movie bring is a new Sea civilization which we can't imagine.Visual, cinematography, music, and direction are best.But a little bit of complain from viewers that longtime run and story is weak. Director should've give attention on story. There is no any new narratives in story telling.Most of interesting part of this movie is second half and the visual of under the sea. Afterall other action part is bit of boring. But yeah ! James Cameron did his best.","

Action packed 3+ hours with the most amazing visuals you'll ever see and a good story to go with it. I'm not sure what more those people critical of it want?See it on the big screen and in 3D to really appreciate the mind blowing visuals. You will certainly get your money's worth.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","stitch-43375","17 December 2022","Do not look at the special effects but the message within the movie. Is that what we want our kids to see. Watching this movie is like watching the news Russia invading another country and destroying it all. Oh my, how is that everybody is liking this movie. Me and my family watched in Dolby 3D and it was like watching a big screen Samsung with TrueMotion Plus Smoothing cracked to the max. It was like watching a 3 hrs long game like Resident Evil. JC moves to high frame rate (48 frames per second) to enhance this sequel which progresses from land to sea. People are not looking at the big picture. Ya know the elephant in the room.Second, this looked more like nature documentary about how we killed the Indians and destroyed their civilization. How Russia invaded another country. There is so much death. So many animals getting killed. Keep in mind first movie is supposedly year 2154 and second around year 2164, so apparently we learned nothing. We destroyed planet Earth and now we seek to destroy Pandora which is a moon in the star system. There are animal attacks, war scenes, major explosions, fire destruction, near-deaths, and lots of deaths, Corpses shown both animal and human, sequences of strong violence, and some strong language. What may be most disturbing to young children is the cruelty to animals and kids. Animals are hunted and killed, children are kidnapped, handcuffed, and tortured. I know is fake-whale. But still.. Is that what we want to display to kids?Third, some bad guys from first movie comes back in the sequel. Yeah, no originality. They come back as avatars. Of course they are after Jake Sully.Fourth, all Jake's kids speak English. One would think to teach them the Navi language fluently.Fifth, upon arriving at the sea which is very very far from the forest, everybody speaks English fluently. Not only that but they know slang words. Swear words and profanity are NUMEROUS throughout Avatar 2. Since Dr. Grace Augustine was not at sea teaching them English, then who did..?? How did they learn perfect English?Sixth, this movie is supposedly 10 years after the first one, but apparently Jake did not prepare for the second battle. They came back more powerful than ever, so Jake wife and kids abandoned the forest and go to sea to seek refuge and consequently destroy another tribe.Seventh, people beware, those with photosensitivity and epilepsy, Avatar: The Way of Water is NOT photosensitive friendly and may induce seizures.So that's my two cents. And just like what JC did in Terminator, the villain here will be back in Avatar 3. He never dies. Who knows, maybe he'll be back in Avatar 4 and Avatar 5. Sorry JC, I've been waiting 13 years for the sequel and was disappointed. Jacques-Yves Cousteau Would be disappointed.. talk about war, destruction, Ukraine.. wow...","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","czunic","25 June 2023","Visually, the movie is absolutely beautiful. However much they spent on the visual effects was well spent. The movie makes an excellent screen saver and/or ambient lighting if you turn off the sound.But aside from that... The script is fairly terrible, the acting is relatively fair, and the screenplay is uneven and uninspired. The plot is essentially the same as the first 'Avatar', but you don't really care about any of the characters this time around. The requisite battle scenes are there and they are, of course, majestic. Lots of whooping and hissing.The movie is weighed down by what amounts to about two hours of filler: it's Avatars being pretty Avatars. There are many, MANY lengthy segments that don't feel like they have anything to do with the plot; They make you feel like you are watching a nature documentary with killer special effects.Formulaic and predictable, but definitely pretty to look at. But there is absolutely no reason this movie needed to be over 3 hours long.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","aji4u4ever","22 December 2022","Being a fan of Avatar since that was an awesome experience even though the runtime was around 3 hours. I was dying to watch Avatar 2 in theaters and the wait was 13 long years.Avatar 2 can be considered as visually extravagant with amazing scenes which will captivate you mainly the underwater sequences. But the 13 years they took for making this CGI masterpiece, they could have invested that in the plot. The story is wafer-thin, blatant, cringed and cliched. The dialogues were like ""meh"". The crux of the story is like a rehash of avatart. Adding to that, the movie is excessively long which will test your patience even though the scenes are alluring. The action scenes were okayish, there are lot more parts in which the continuity goes to the space. I think James Cameroon invested his major time and hard work into the technicalities and the other side went west. The another major letdown is the background score, which is not elevating a single scene in the movie.Bottomline
A Visual treat overstretched boring movie.","

The 3D was something to behold and absolutely amazing underwater scenes. The 3 hours fly by for this incredible achievement in cinema experience, I loved all the new chracters especially the children and Spider was an excellent human character. The sky people are great villains who's state of the art equipment is used to try and crush the Navi resistance but the Navi have all the tools to fight back leading to an epic climactic battle on the water, you have never sceen such an awesome battle put to screen before. Go see it no disappointments at all. 10/10.","

Sky people are bad, navi are good. Even the dead villian from the first movie is back, and he's gonna be back in the next movie. WHY? Why would cameron spend so much money to remake a movie he made 10 years ago? Avatar is the marvel franchise now. Cameron is gonna make 6 avatar movies and they will all be the same movie.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","hnkysww","17 December 2022","It's quite Impressive that it has been 13 years since the first movie came out, and yet the visual effects for this epic and long-awaited sequel have been improved in such an incredible way. Chronologically, the events of Avatar: The Way of Water take place 15 years after the events of the first movie. When the People of the Sky are banished from Pandora except those who remained loyal to Sully.SPOILERS AHEAD... In this sequel, we see Jake Sully and Neytiri once again, with their newly formed family of 5 children. Colonel Miles Quaritch returns to Pandora, this time in Avatar Form along with his wisest soldiers who remained loyal to him. Quartich plots a plan to track down and kill Jake Sully, which leads the whole family to move from their home once again, to a reef where more Na'vi People live, called The Metkayina Clan, who show the family their ways, teach them to ride as the Metkayina do, new species underwater, and explore their beautiful reefs. Meanwhile, the threatening and merciless People of the Sky prepare to bring the war on Metkayina territory without even thinking of surrendering nor resting, not until having at least Jake Sully murdered. Of course, they end up failing in the attempt once again. As a conclusion, this sequel is one that no person who watched the first movie can miss.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","villard","6 August 2023","The first 30 minutes of the sequel had me engaged with drama.But the story pacing falls off the cliff once the forest aliens go to waterworld. It's like watching two hours of someone's Hawaii vacation videos. And I really could care less about a dysfunctional family's woes.Once again, a gusher of nonstop razzle dazzle computer graphics that outpace the Disney Little Mermaid's underwater world don't substitute for a lackadaisical story.It gets soooo boring I would have fast forward the video if I were watching it alone. I think I kept looking at the clock about every ten minutes, counting down to the grand finale.Of course in the last 30 minutes all hell break loose. Some scenes of the sinking ""whale-hunting"" ship are reminiscent of Cameron's ""Titanic"" and ""The Abyss"". I'm convinced the man is preoccupied with water sports.The story is nonsensical that Jake Sully, supposedly the great military leader, has to run and hide with his family as the moon is being overtaken . Jeeez, he's no George Washington. It really makes him look ineffectual. His escape obviously can't slow down the invasion, and it's inevitable that Sully is gonna be hunted down on the small moon.Equally nonsensical is that the sequel shifts from the search for ""unobtanium,"" to a need for humanity to colonize a small moon. That's a pretty expensive and misguided effort to get some modest celestial real estate.And if that is not enough, the Earth invaders want to harvest some precious fluid from a sea mammal's brain after it is killed. Uh, just synthesize it in an Earth-lab like we do in modern medicine, like insulin.The fact that the cloned bad guy Quaritch manages to survive for another day of mayhem, leaves the film wide open to a string of sequels which I hope are less monotonous.","

Again it is a nice simple story yes and the script has some weak dialogue but they do the story so well it makes up for it.In a 3 hour film not once was I bored or checking my phone. The times when literally nothing is happening in the story I couldn't look away, I'm so engaged in Pandora I could watch their day to day lives every film.People will say it's just visuals but there's great action, good world building and some good new characters too. The visuals are truly breathtaking though! Such a visually beautiful movie especially in 3D. Every time they would go underwater taking that breath in it made me take a breath too every single time.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots. Avatar 2 is entertaining the whole way through and I really recommend seeing this at the movies especially in 3D...I will watch every Avatar James Cameron makes.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","grantss","10 April 2023","Several years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion Jake Sully and his family are living on Pandora. Things seem peaceful but the RDA has other plans, invading and capturing Pandora. Sully forms a guerrilla group to try to expel the invaders.The first Avatar, released in 2009, was visually stunning but had a very weak plot. The story was basic, cheesy and predictable, like it was meant for kids. Characters were hardly developed at all, so you have very little empathy for them. Making it even worse, the film was massively padded, with several scenes adding nothing except to the running time which clocks in at an insomnia-curing 160 minutes.Avatar: The Way of Water is more of the same. Great special effects, weak, cheesy story, one-dimensional characters. Running time is even more excessive, clocking in at 192 minutes due to a plot that just drifts for an eternity in the middle section. Director James Cameron could easily have cut an hour out of the film without subtracting from the story (what there is). But then he would have less time to show off his CGI skills, wouldn't he?","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","shaikhirshad-41223","16 December 2022","Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for creating such a beautiful world to experience it and to dive in for like 3 and half hours. First of all it doesn't feel like 3 hours has passed when you sat to watch on the film. The film is so mesmerising like you can feel every bit of the scenes that the director is trying to show. The way James Cameron designs his characters, species and the whole world is just powerful and I don't think anyone can nearly touch him in this kind of things. He doesn't focus on story but the way he gives time to his characters the world building the visual experience scenes that shows how creative he is. VISUALS in this film is on another level. It feels like you are actually diving in the water world experience. The animals that he created for water world is just amazing to see their design & the making of this creatures is so damn good. There are many characters in the movie but by the end of the film you'll easily know all characters because that's the creativity of James Cameron. He gives every character its time to perform and to build the story for the perfect conclusion. Actors are powerful and specially all cast has done tremendously well job. As compare to part 1 part 2 is very strong in Visuals, Emotions, Actions but lack of human side this time because the director has more focused on the water world and it's visuals. Try to watch this in as big screen as possible. And if you love the 1st one then this will blow your mind....","

Lazy writing - this movie copies its predecessor to such an extent that they did not bother to change the main villain. 20% of the dialog was ""Bro, I got you bro."".The visuals
I must admit there were few moments in the movie that were visually amazing, however this is not planet earth. And for the most part, nothing shown in this movie is as groundbreaking as its predecessor. Compare this to a Marvel movie - what does it offer apart from couple imagined species that the former doesn't?The character development
Again, very lazy writing (writing reviews is not my job - I can get away with redundancy not a top grossing movie). They literally had 3 hours to build character, but all we have is the main villain's son who has absolutely no idea what to do or say, and gets away with almost anything? They tried to build inner conflict, but it comes off as, guess what? Lazy.","

In these days of extreme pollical correctness, we are bound to suffer these things.I appreciate the beautiful special effects, but three hours of color-saturated shots with no compelling argument is too much. The shallow calls for ""away with technology and let's be one with Nature"" sounds infantile and hypocritical, given all the high-tech dumped in this movie.There I was at the dine-in movie theater in my spacious reclinable chair and munching on a delicious burger, while I'm being told I really should be trotting half-naked in a loin-cloth without pockets to put my phone and all exposed to rain and cold.

I was watching the movie with a friend and he couldn't help but fall sleep.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","stevenwentworth","23 January 2023","What have I just watched? I'm not sure if it was the cinema where we watched Avatar 2, but the screen was far too dark with 3D glasses on and the quality was really grainy. It was almost like watching a cheap pirated version on VHS in 1982. The sound was just loud... No surround sound, just the volume cranked up to maximum.The storyline is weak and the plot is definitely aimed at very young children, which I suppose you'd expect from a Disney film. Basically, the story is just the original Avatar but with water! Jake Sully has somehow managed to raise a bunch of spoilt, entitled little brats. James Cameron has decided to spend most of the film showing off his animation rather than developing a brand new plot. It just felt as though we had to endure 50% of the time watching James Cameron give himself a pat on the back for doing such a good job with the effects... it felt narcissistic to say the least. Having said that, the animation is extremely good, but when animation gets that good and almost indistinguishable from real life, then there's nothing to show off any more. Your eyes just believe what they're seeing and it loses the wow factor. Great animation alone is NOT enough. You need a decent story too.I wouldn't recommend anyone go to see this at the cinema. If you want to see it, wait until it comes out on Disney later this year. The 3D just isn't necessary and if you're watching it at home at least you can press pause for a toilet break! For the cost of one visit to the cinema plus food and drink, you could have a subscription to Disney plus for a year!!!We left the cinema half way through the showing which is something I've never done before. It didn't help that the cinema was too cold and the entire viewing experience was so poor, but if Avatar 2 had really been good enough we might have put up with the discomfort to find out how the Sullys got on fighting the bad guys. However, in the end, we just didn't care about any of the characters and all we could think about was finding the nearest toilet and getting in the car to warm up.I really wanted to like Avatar 2 but this was disappointing to say the least. The film is too long for children or anyone with a small or weak bladder and the plot is too simplistic for anyone over 10 years old. 12 years to come up with this sequel... Speechless.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Jithindurden","18 December 2022","James Cameron did it again! This is a visual masterpiece that may be even better than the first part. Beyond the breathtaking and landmark visuals and the on-point politics which only become more and more important, especially from the country it is coming from, there is a magic that Cameron creates here that touches your soul.While rewatching the first part from the theatres, I felt that part of it and realized there's so much more to it than what is on the surface. It is even more clear here. I used to think Cameron is wasting years of his life on these projects but I can really see why he dedicates it to these. Way of Water made me feel, how spiritual these films are and how much they would've meant to Cameron. My favourite parts in this film are in the middle when the Sully family finds and connects with the different lifeforms and the life of water. The mystery behind the character of Kiri really added to my understanding of the importance of the spiritual aspect in the film.While looking at these films we can think that if they wanted to show the issues with imperialism and capitalism, and the importance of environmentally sustainable indigenous life, they didn't have to make it happen in an alien environment and this is simply a way to explore the visuals and the commerce with it. But watching this has really changed my opinion on that. I really get why Cameron waited long years before making these films to achieve the complete vision he had. The basic concepts he had to tell have been told in various ways so many times. But they are not magical enough to reach the hearts of the viewers the way something as visually stunning as Avatar does. But beyond just the visualization, there are so many factors hindering that in other iterations of this story. The world is inherently capitalistic and so many of the depictions of the truths would be viewed in a sympathetic light but still considered by most as a necessity or something that cannot be stopped. Spirituality has become a corrupted term that is only used by those who want to extort money and power from people. The corruption in the collective psyche of the world doesn't allow anyone to believe in the triumph of a social uprising by the marginalized anymore. When it is viewed from a distance as an Alien world, where nature itself can communicate with you, provide everything needed and doesn't really have anything to gain from the globalization of the western world it becomes much more plausible to believe in it. It actually showcases a world where natural social evolution would have taken a species without interference from a handful of people who holds power. Even those who firmly believe against such a social evolution would start believing in the way these aliens live. Showing the Na'vi people being truly one with nature and finding the beauty of the world and its meaning with it makes the film the ultimate spiritual exercise by Cameron to tell his philosophy on life. And he doesn't abandon his fun-loving side to do that. He indulges in giving you exhilarating action scenes along with the way of water in this film. The improved 3D technology and the 48 fps make sure it's not a gimmick and instead make you feel you are in there with them experiencing it.This film pays homage to a lot of older films of Cameron and parenthood has been something he liked to dabble with a lot. Here that is the central point of the plot and why most of the events occur in the order they happened. Unlike some other films, when they speak about family here, it resonates and makes the proper impact.For me, Way of Water is even better than the first part. This is one of the best films of the year and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequels because I can really see that this is just the beginning.","

The visuals are a whole nother level. I watched it in 3d and I'm ready to watch it again in 3d isense next week. Who ever said never under estimate James Cameron, they are absolutely right. I'll be very shocked if this movie flops at the box office cause I think this movie can't flop. Everyone will love this movie for sure, and it's a movie that people will watch keep coming back to the cinema for. This is a masterpiece and a visual monster.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","W011y4m5","18 December 2022","I think it's fair to say 2022's ""Avatar: The Way of The Water"" does to the inexorably successful, groundbreaking 2009 box office juggernaut what ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" & ""Aliens"" commendably did to the original installments in their iconic, respective sci-fi franchises & thus, somehow (despite many people's cynical doubts) against all odds, the indomitable force of nature James Cameron is once again responsible for some of the most impressive filmmaking & world building put to screen in a movie sequel I've seen... Arguably ever, throughout the history of cinema, expanding upon the first's narrative with a consistency, discipline, truthfulness & austere maturity that I can't help but find utterly staggering to witness.Vital lessons have been learned, amendments have been meticulously made & the tailored refinements result in a product that carefully improves upon the original astonishingly, developing both the ensemble & the software used to bring them to life efficaciously. For example, just as the reality that the world around us has evolved (both technologically & societally) since the initial film's explosion in to the stratosphere of pop culture, so has the story set upon the planet of Pandora & the characters housed within its vast, bioluminescent expanses have noticeably grown wiser, more weary in contrast to when we last saw them (understandably jaded from their traumatic experiences), adding beautifully realised layers of depth to their characterisations which enhance the narrative by providing it with a level of emotional complexity & moral ambiguity that its predecessor was perhaps devoid of, by comparison (though I never previously realised it before until now); rather than continuing with capturing the leads in their youth, naively pursuing reckless ambitions of devout martyrdom & glory amidst a sea of banshees & bullets, bravely endangering themselves for a righteous cause they strongly believe in, the writers alternatively make the inspired decision to highlight how the creation of a family unit can drastically alter one's responsibilities, allegiances & values, shifting the stakes considerably - with their actions lensed through the perspective of parenthood - bringing their earlier valiant behaviours in to disrepute & consequently theorising that given the alteration in conditions, perhaps stoically warring against perceived inevitability (in a futile quest for pride, retribution or liberation) isn't worth the price paid when the toll inflicted is no longer potentially just with your life, but it could equally be exacted upon the lives of those whom you hold dearest? Due to this, maybe it's even selfish & sanctimonious? Subsequently, many fascinating, philosophical questions are asked (though particular emphasis is placed upon theorising whether one's definition of selflessness changes, depending on the person's unique situation) & the lines between incorruptible good / bad become less distinguishable when we're confronted with the notion that these new relationships aren't necessarily strengths or weaknesses, nor is the premise as simple as we'd prefer it to be; inherent traits of love V evil give way to far more nuanced expressions of humanity (& inhumanity, as either side is capable of expressing both in their own authentic way, when provoked), allowing for dramatic tension & naturally occuring conflict - that's engaging & deliciously complicated - to arise magnificently from those subtle dynamics. Moreover, the script intelligently possesses a frank (& genuinely honest) acknowledgment that maintaining fragile peace (sought to preserve one's bloodline) ironically comes at a personal cost, just as much as disturbing it does - & therefore, the legendary director uses the 3+ hour runtime to forensically analyse which approach is plausibly more destructive in the long term (to their sense of self & surroundings, for is tranquility simply delaying the unavoidable?) & he dares to debate whether fighting is ultimately worth the risk, in the grand scheme of things - or perchance, if passivity / cowardice is the only defensible method of guaranteeing the preservation of native people & the longevity of their sacred traditions? In addition to that, the children are used remarkably to highlight how the legacy created from such profound, past achievements can haunt those who are destined to try & step out from under that dauntingly monumental shadow in the future. Hence, it's not just an exploration of a strained family dynamic (when put under immense pressure), but how one lives up to the standards set by our forebears, whose successes have set a seemingly insurmountable high standard, for which they find themselves hesitant as to whether they could realistically achieve parity with in the present. Ergo, they're not simply battling the worst of humanity & the physical manifestations of it, but they are equally in perpetual conflict with their own demons & insecurities, internally - fighting on a physical & emotional level. Quite poetic, don't you think - considering the conditions of this hotly anticipated release?Special acknowledgement must also be made to the notably naturalistic way in which the series has developed too; seldom do tales progress so organically, with such effective & relative ease, flourishing like a tree, with its branches protruding outwards; characters behave in surprisingly conceivable ways, respond consistently to events as they unfold (where we can sympathise with their choices) & never rely on forced, artificially constructed moments of convenient contrivance to justify furthering the plot; each member of the ensemble is relatable, distinguished, flawed & set on a tightly focused journey that incredibly never deviates from their clear & unique path. Thus, the reach of this spans far further than before & yet irrespective of Cameron's bulging scale & undeniable grandiosity, the heart & intimacy is still never lost amongst the chaos of the ensuing carnage. Due to this, the soul captured magically in ""Avatar"" is resultantly retained unquestionably throughout & by the credits, everyone's arcs have come to a rewarding conclusion (until the next chapter). Heck, I'd say this feels even more personal & sincere - evocatively daring to provoke & challenge the audience with audacious creative decisions that may genuinely unsettle (a major gamble for a production of this size & magnitude) but thematically, it's faultlessly coherent, echoing the relevant, pre-established ecological messaging, gifting viewers with an experience that seems satisfyingly accurate, given the trajectory of their collective advancements.Speaking of which, if you thought the Oscar winning pioneer was willing to relinquish his title as the embodiment of what it means to be a visionary, industry defining trailblazer... Think again; paired with his veteran ""Titanic"" & ""True Lies"" cinematographer Russell Carpenter, even solely from a technical point of view, the duo have visually revivified the theatre going experience in a manner which can only be described as ""seismic"" & it's hard to imagine that this hasn't substantially changed the game forever, henceforth. You have not witnessed real epic spectacle until you've laid eyes on the fruits of their labour. In the same way we were given a glimpse of what to expect from productions years in advance before, so too are we, presently. It is a total, ingenious reinvention.Can't believe I'm saying this for a third consecutive time but he's essentially presented us with another masterpiece, formed from the hands of a goliath, unstoppable storyteller, operating confidently at the height of his power, showcasing a project that's irrefutably awe inspiring, spinning so many plates in the air & yet miraculously not dropping a single one, pushing each & every creative department involved in the feature's inception to its limit until boundaries are broken & inconceivably transcended. See it on the biggest screen possible (IMAX 3D) & prepare yourself, as if you're like me, you'll quickly be resisting the urge to attend repeat screenings, frequently - merely to absorb it all more thoroughly. I cannot recommend it highly enough. There's so much to process & digest but I seriously adored it.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","LonelyGhost","14 December 2022","The visual effects are amazing. But Cameron should be better than this.I'm a big fan of Mr Cameron. Not only for his directing skills, but also for his screenwriting skills. But this time he seemed to have missed the goal. I know he rarely does sequels. But is this the best he could do? The story has not changed anything compared to the previous episode. Repeated crises, repeated enemies, repeated conflicts,and wait a minute,WHAT? Even repeated Titanic. Are you serious?As a director, he also did not reach his previous level. For a long time, the pace of the film felt too slow. Yes, the underwater scenes are phenomenal. But this is not the Blue Planet, this is a sci-fi action movie. At least it's what most audiences expect from the film, isn't it?","

After the first 30 minutes, I was worried that I had not become attached the the story or any character. One hour in and I started playing a game on my phone. I didn't care about anyone or anything. This movie was just one big ego stroke for Cameron. It's nothing more than a three hour high quality video game that you can't play. All of the humans, including the reincarnated ones, are annoying as hell. And we suffered through three hours just because the memories from one dead marine wants revenge?

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tommy-97761","17 December 2022","Do you absolutely need to see this movie? No.The 3D, the CGI, the Action are excellent, yes. In the past 13 yeast we had however seen similar. I feel like the reviews claiming that this is an esential blockbuster spectacle are exaggerated. Given the run time of 3+ hours, nice CGI really isn't enough to keep you engaged.The storytelling is problematic. I went into the movie expecting a simple story and there is nothing wrong with that. Top Gun Maveric was simple, but it worked. The story is simple, the characters are interesting, likeable. The problem is with the plot, which suffers from a couple of convenient deus ex machinas that were not set up before hand. On the other hand there are some 'problems' in the climax that could have been solved pretty easily by the new skills the characters had acquired, yet they do not do it because... reasons. The movie then suffers from resolutions that don't really feel earned, but also drama that feels fabricated just for the sake of tension.Though I had a good time, I absolutely do not feel like I need or want to see this movie again in the cinema again, nor do I feel compelled to send there my friends and family. I have seen The Batman, Top Gun Maverick and The Northmen twice in cinema this year. Avatar 2 was good, but didn't really feel essential.Oh, there is no after credit scene, so no need to wait.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","blakekhodges","18 December 2022","The haters are desperate to find ways to dig into this movie. Don't buy it. This is a landmark achievement, and pop entertainment not only at its finest, but pushing deep into new frontiers. The visual mastercraft of this film barely needs to even be mentioned. Haters will have you believe this film has ""no plot."" Or ""a weak script."" The fact is, James Cameron and team had my wife bawling her eyes out over a fictional, CG whale. I was rooting, crying, and cheering out loud for weird blue Smurf athletes over genuine human characters. I was left emotionally exhausted after the (admittedly long) 3.5 hour experience from all the highs and lows. Were these feelings driven by great visual effects? No. They were driven by a genuinely exciting, moving story, with characters I was invested in 100%. And that's more to say than 99% of the rest of the drivel Hollywood dishes out. James Cameron (and by extension, his creative team) are in an extremely rare position in the film industry. They have almost unlimited resources at their disposal, and unchecked creativity. And unlike most other studios and filmmakers in that position, they delivered. This is not fan service. It's not pandering to some larger brand strategy or IP. This is pure drive to make the best damn movie possible. And holy Avatar, they did it.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Anurag-Shetty","18 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water continues with the story of Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) & his partner Neytiri(Zoe Saldana), after the events of Avatar(2009). Jake & Neytiri have a family of five children & are raising them in Pandora. When an old foe returns to finish what he started, Jake & Neytiri must join forces with the Na'vi army to protect their family.Avatar: The Way of Water is a mind-blowing film. Director James Cameron always reminds us about the novelty of the theatrical experience & redefines cinema, each time he returns to the director's chair. The visual effects are jaw-dropping & surpasses its 2009 predecessor which is the highest grossing movie of all time. The performance capture is phenomenal & is the highlight. The action set pieces are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. Story wise, Avatar(2009) surpasses this film. The story of this movie is quite basic. That is its only flaw. Sam Worthington is outstanding as Jake. Zoe Saldana is spectacular as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is awesome as Kiri. Stephen Lang is brilliant as Quaritch. Kate Winslet & Cliff Curtis are excellent as Ronal & Tonowari, respectively. Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion & Bailey Bass are incredible as Neteyam, Lo'ak, Tuk, Spider & Tsireya, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Avatar: The Way of Water is a must watch for Avatar(2009) & James Cameron fans. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & have a whale of a time!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","PotassiumMan","24 December 2022","James Cameron is bringing us back into the mysterious world of Pandora, an Earth-like planet somewhere in space, where the Avatars live. What is most remarkable for this sequel is that you don't need to know about or remember any details from the first movie to dive into this story at all. The visual effects are incredibly made, and most worthwhile to watch in 3D. With love for details in its flora and fauna, this foreign world is brought to life. At the core, this movie is focused on the bond of family under challenging circumstances, as well as about adapting to a new environment.This film should be credited for resurrecting of one of the most memorably ferocious villains in recent cinematic history. It is also a very reflective story line about humankind or here referred to as the ""Sky People"" who invade and destroy unknown territories before trying to find peaceful ways. This film is the best this holiday season from its visual execution as well as from its storyline and is highly recommended to everyone.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","851222","20 December 2022","Greetings from Lithuania.As a big fan of first ""Avatar"" and even bigger fan of Mr. James Cameron's other movies, I had high hopes for ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" (2022). If there is one blockbuster type movie maker that can always deliver unseen spectacle - its him. And ""Way of Water"" is another proof of that - this movie was incredible in every possible way. If there is a future for huge movie events in theater - this one is the perfect example of it.I won't go into plot but will say that it worked for a sequel - there is a bit of everything, but at its core its a story about family and its connection with nature. The standuot performance to me was Kiri (Sigourney Weaver). She stole every scene she was in. There is a running theme about who her father is, and while there is no answer yet, I think if watched this and previous movies closely and got the overall theme of it, her identity is more then obvious.As for technical stuff - this movie is like no other out there. You have to see it to believe. If the first movie was amazing movie going experience (saw it 3 times back in the day), ""Way of Water"" tops it in every way. The energy of this movie, pacing were superb - during its 3 hours run time never was I bored nor not involved. Music was superb as well.Overall, if you like movies in general, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must see experience. Watch it on the biggest screen possible and 3D - its the way it meant to be seen. The immersion is like no other. Can't wait for a 3rd movie. What a terrific movie.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","3xHCCH","15 December 2022","The setting was shifted from the lush rainforest to the open seas, introducing different cultures and different creatures. However, the story of this sequel was pretty much a rehash of the story of the 2009 film -- about the abuse and destruction of colonization. It was the story of Pocahontas all over again, for which the first one was already roundly criticized before. As they were in the first film, these unsettling scenes were painful and maddening to watch.Furthermore, they added a prolonged, sadistic and harrowing scene of men ganging down on and killing a giant sea creature. The whole scene was dismal and disgusting in its graphic display of methodical cruelty to animals, reminding viewers of all the unnecessary and wasteful hunting of elephants and rhinoceroses that happens to this day. Seeing the nasty head poacher get his deserved (albeit grisly) comeuppance was a satisfying thrill.There is now a rich aspect of family relationships and adolescent psychology involved in the story giving this more dramatic weight. About the struggles experienced by the middle child, the adopted child, the different child, a child who does not know who his father was, a child whose father people despised, a child pressured with too much expectations. It was a familial conflict that would figure in the climactic confrontation.James Cameron's estimated budget of the whole film passed USD350M, and all the spectacular special effects all that money went to can clearly be seen onscreen. This film is practically an animated film already, with all the motion-capture Na'vi characters there instead of the actual actors. Aside from Edie Falco as the General, the only real human characters we see were those nameless soldiers who get killed in the battles.The biggest innovation in this film was the technology for motion capture for underwater scenes, something that has never been done before. Cameron really went all the way in creating a CGI marine biosphere for these Na'vi creatures to interact with water creatures big and small, sacred and mystical. Seeing the callous ways humans invade and destroy such natural beauty and balance sent out a potent pro-environment message.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","MrDHWong","15 December 2022","""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is the long-awaited sequel to 2009's highest grossing film of all time (not adjusted for inflation). Directed and co-written by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, it once again offers dazzling visual effects, great use of 3D technology, exciting action scenes... and that's about it.Over ten years after the events of the first film, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) has settled into a peaceful life on Pandora with his Na'vi family, consisting of his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their four children. However, Jake's idyllic world is soon thrown into jeopardy after a previous threat returns to finish what was started more than a decade ago. With few other options left to explore, Jake decides to seek help from the nearby reef tribe whose very existence revolves around living as one with the aquatic life. As the danger becomes more apparent, Jake's forest dwelling tribe and their marine counterparts must work together to set aside their personal differences before Pandora as they know it is lost forever.James Cameron's multi-million dollar 2009 film ""Avatar"" is quite possibly one of the most enigmatic pieces of media ever released. How can a film that grossed over $2.8 billion at the global box office leave so little impression on pop culture? After more than ten years since its initial release, there are still several people who cannot even remember a single line from the movie or name just three of its many characters. Nevertheless, the general consensus among all of those who saw it agree that the film was a visual treat and featured some jaw-dropping use of 3D. Whether or not the public wanted a sequel (let alone four of them) is a matter of debate but 13 years, a Disney buyout, and a history-changing pandemic later, we finally have ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", a follow-up that does pretty much exactly what the original did but looking much nicer while doing it.Like the original, the plot is basically ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Pocahontas"", and ""FernGully"" set in outer space with blatant pro-environmental, anti-military messages constantly beating us over the head. Although I am fine with the idea of protecting the Earth and are fully aware that the military is capable of some truly awful things, there are better ways of conveying this to us rather than through the shameless guilt tripping that both the original and this sequel has going for it. Before its release, I was hoping this follow-up would at least try something different from its predecessor since a common criticism was that it was ripping off all of the aforementioned movies. But to my disappointment, the writers (all five of them) seem to have taken these complaints in stride because what we have here is a simply carbon copy of the original, only with flashier visual effects.With all of that said, the visuals are absolutely fantastic and clearly this film's saving grace. Right from the very beginning, James Cameron brings us back to the brightly-coloured world of Pandora we remember with stunning environments that actually look like they've been lived in. The forests still brim with that beautiful iridescent light and the CGI wildlife are all flawlessly integrated into this picturesque ecosystem. However, as the title would suggest, the main setting is in the water, which is where the film impresses the most. There's so much beauty to appreciate in the way the water realistically glistens in the sunlight along with witnessing how all the aquatic creatures inhabit this living space. All of this was apparently done by combining groundbreaking CGI with the real on-set locations filmed off the coast of New Zealand. Practically every individual shot of this movie looks like it cost at least $1 million and it certainly shows. This is definitely a movie that needs to been seen at the cinema in 3D, as I imagine watching in on a tiny screen like a phone wouldn't do it justice. In other words, seeing this film in 3D at the cinema is not an option, it is a requirement.Also, for a film that runs for over 3 hours (192 minutes to be precise), there isn't really all that much in it that could be considered ""boring"", at least not by my standards. There's plenty of fast paced action and dazzling visuals to keep the audience occupied that you can forget about the movie's lengthy runtime for the most part. Even some scenes that are obviously intended as filler for the sake of eye candy move at such a reasonable pace that I found them to be forgivable in the long run. It seems that James Cameron was aware that if he was going to make a movie that clocks in at over 3 hours, he should at least make each moment as entertaining as possible to prevent the audience from losing interest. Of course, none of that really matters if you have a weak bladder so I don't recommend drinking too much water before embarking on a viewing.There's not really a whole lot worth mentioning about the characters since they were all generic and bland to begin with. Most of them haven't changed all that much since the first movie, which is surprising considering more than ten years have passed since then. Jake Sully is still the same as when we last saw him, only this time he has a wife and four children, and that's about it. Sam Worthington plays him to the best of his ability, which is a generic protagonist with a good heart. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't feel any emotional connection to the other characters, except for maybe some of the sea life, which resemble real world animals like whales and dolphins. To quote Red Letter Media's Mr. Plinkett; ""The ultimate irony with Avatar is that for all the time and money spent to make this movie in 3D, the story and the characters were still stuck in one dimension.""
Taking into account the sheer scale of its world building and special effects, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an astonishing achievement in visual filmmaking. Like its predecessor, it sets out to be an immersive experience for anyone seeking a brief method of escape from the real world, and on that note I believe it succeeds. Sure, it's easy to pick the film apart for its unoriginal story, forgettable characters, and belated release, but that won't change the fact that it still looks amazing with all of these faults in tow. According to James Cameron, there are three more sequels on the horizon, with each due out once every two years. My only hope is that these ones will feel different, because this franchise can only survive on eye candy for so long before audiences become desensitised. Call me old fashioned, but I'll always prefer a great story over great visuals.I rate it 8/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","apereztenessa-1","17 December 2022","For the second time (the first being the first Avatar movie), James Cameron seems committed to proving that he can take any story, however basic it might be, and turn it into an engaging and exciting movie through pure mastery of the art of filmmaking.Avatar The Way of Water expands on the world and ecology message of the first Avatar movie and adds a number of new, young characters that inject new energy into the story. It is particularly appreciated that these young characters are likable unlike so many of the spoiled youth depicted in movies and shows today. In the end, however, the story of the movie is not particularly interesting, let alone original. But James Cameron's mastery of filming, editing, sound and of every other aspect of filmmaking makes the movie a total blast to watch, even if one doesn't ever really know why. Such belief in the power of the moving image to move audiences is refreshing at a time when the movie experience is constantly being degraded and the theatre experience at risk.From a story standpoint, beyond the character introductions and some small details, it all feels very similar to the first Avatar. The main difference is maybe that the bad guys this time around have adopted the form of the Na'vi. Beyond making hand to hand combat scenes more balanced, this change turns the core conflict in the movie from an ethnic and cultural conflict into what appears -at least visually- as a pure power struggle. One can imagine possible echoes with the evolution of the North American society movements in the last ten years.","

I've never found myself looking at the time so often or considering fast forwarding sections.Ultimately, it was never going to match the first film but I was surprised how big the gap would be. There were some elements that were mildly enjoyable, such as the transition from the forest to the water, but unlike the first which I have seen countless times, overall this is a forgettable film that I'll unlikely ever watch again.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","david-evans-16-536242","17 December 2022","The good: The visuals obviously, are as good as the first. I like the World of the water people. Great introduction to another part of an interesting World. The whale creatures were very cool. Having another intelligent species with a 3 dimensional backstory was refreshing. The children were also a great addition. Thought I wouldn't like them, but they were interesting, and had a purpose.The bad: I HATE when sequels bring back characters that were killed off in the previous story. You mean to tell me you can't come up with a new villain?! Like the first movie, I also HATE when humans are just evil. I know we are the villains here, but humanity on the whole does not take pleasure in the death and torture of others. I mean, we even care about animals and won't kill them without reason. Sure, some humans are bad, but virtually every human in this movie was evil, and proud to be it, just like the first movie. Just hate the 1 dimensional nature of the humans. Their motivation to kill in this one was even weaker than the first. Yes, money is always a Cameron motivation for bad humans, but they came back just to kill Sully? Nope, doesn't make sense. And what is with Spider??? Is he a traitor or a friend? He helps the bad guys but is friends with the good guys. His character makes no sense. And yes, it is TOO LONG!!,Don't get me wrong, it's not an awful movie. But Cameron is a much more clever writer than this. Look at Terminator and T2. Solid, well written movies. Aliens, another great movie, well written. Though Avatar had interesting characters, the core writing didn't make sense and Cameron is known for doing better.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Hey_Harry","30 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water is a beautiful film with awesome special effects and stunning scenery showcasing more of the Na'vi's homeworld, Pandora. The movie also features some of the most amazing CGI facial expressions I've seen to date. The underwater scenes, which make up the bulk of the film, are nothing short of breathtaking.However, what makes the film fall short as a sequel to Avatar is the narrative structure which feels disjointed. The original Avatar had a fairly basic story but it was well-executed whereas the story in Avatar 2 is punctuated by a constant shift between different characters and subplots. While Avatar 2's story is still engaging on some level, it's not as cohesive as in the original Avatar and if anything, most of the film feels like a setup for future sequels where things will finally wrap up. Regardless, the movie is still worth it for the visual spectacle alone and James Cameron once again cements his status as the King of the Sequels.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Flak36","9 July 2023","I didn't like the first movie, so why would I like this one, right? Except the sequel is so much worse I just don't understand how it made so much money.In the words of George Lucas: ""one has an artistic problem, and then one invents a technology to solve it.""
In other words: Technology and visual effects alone don't make a movie! You need to tell a story!In this mess barely anything makes sense and the dialogue is so atrocious it makes even people from non-English speaking countries cringe. ""Hey bro! I got you bro! Watch it bro!""
Is this how alien species from a fantasy world talk in Cameron's imagination? Or is this how James Cameron likes to talk, therefore he makes his actors imitate him? Kinda like everyone talks like Tarantino in a Tarantino movie or like Tommy Wisaeu in 'The Room'.There's so much more I could say about this mess, but it's been said already by other people. This movie is objectively bad. You can like it as much as you want, but it's a nonsensical mess.","

The actor must have some contract to fulfil... All in all, fantastic audio and visual experience with lovely messages and morals just
like the first film. There were some nice new characters and old but there were also plenty of boring new ones. Basically this movie is: Jake and family go on a vacation to Sea World in order to get away from the exact same recycled plot and villain from the first film. There were some differences luckily but everyone will see the similarities. The continuation and utilisation of the spiritual tones were as lovely and meaningful however and that was done beautifully. :)","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jkalandarov","15 December 2022","First of all, movie is 3 hours long. If you are going to watch it on cinema be ready not to go to the toilet for 3 hours. If you want you can go to the toilet but don't worry you won't skip anything important.The movie looks more like a documentary rather than a movie. I watched it on 3D and sometimes the CGI effects seemed like a cartoon. In the first movie we explored many places and creatures of the pandora world. In this one, not too many. Only big whales, and two species of the water creatures, that's all.The script was a bit cheesy. It mainly focused on family problems rather than the world of pandorra or threat to this world. I did not understand how they reserructed dead people, it was out of logic. When they sent people back to I wonder how much time it took them to travel to the Earth. They came back with much more technology which should have taken some time to manufacture. And then coming back to the pandorra should have taken some time too. In my estimation, it should have taken 30-60 years. In their case, it took about 15 years.Jake leaves M'avi tribe to find another place to hide. We don't know what happens to M'avi tribe in the movie. Probably dead, may be not.Overall, it seemed to me that the movie was made in hurry.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","dorMancyx","20 December 2022","Turns out, Jack and Rose didn't need a bigger door to survive, they just needed a Tulkun fin that could fit five Na'vis. With his exceptional zeal for the ocean and water, James Cameron returns with the revived Avatar series after 13 years. When all hopes seem lost for CGI as Marvel disappoints us in a string of controversies, The Way of Water demonstrates yet again the pinnacle of visual effects from this decade, defining what immersive experience truly means as the audience roams the soul-capturing sceneries of Pandora. In addition to the otherworldly techniques, the movie's cinematography, aesthetic design, and biome layout continue to be superb and meticulous, elaborating a dissimilar yet equally appealing face of the planet. It is extremely unusual for a sequel to be produced with this level of sincerity, as I am awed with satisfaction and surprise.(Spoilers and criticisms ahead) Although maintaining the technological quality, the original film's central plot of natives versus colonizers has been simplified into colonel Quaritch's personal vendetta against Jake's family, which, despite saving the time to establish numerous intriguing characters, dilutes the depth of the story. Speaking of characters, both Jake and Neytiri's roles have been greatly reduced to fulfill Lo'ak's dynamic, whose identity crisis and journey of adaption are perceptibly trivial compared to his father's. Kiri's mystical connection to Grave and Eywa is hinted throughout but ends up unexplained; Spider's lineage and relation to Quaritch could have been a major twist especially after Neytiri's frenzy, yet are also left unresolved; Ronal, performed by Kate Winslet, can be portrayed as a queen with traits beyond Mo'at, but simply disappears from the final battle. Not to mention, the reef tribe's tolerance of the Sullys seems rather insensible knowing that the sky people are hunting for them. Too many characters to sketch, and too many threads to knot, as the movie is forced to sacrifice good narration and tempo.However, if ignoring my high expectation, the film's not half bad compared to most other sequels: complete storyline, likable protagonists, and absolutely mind-bending effects. At the very least, I did not feel drowsy at all throughout the three-hour watching. Disregard the cost, find the best theater in the neighborhood, and submerge yourself in The Way of Water.","

This movie shows emotions beyond one can imagine with family being the core thread. Nature, water, aquatic life and everyone/everything is connected. Everyone has a purpose and meaning to serve.Shell out and enjoy this grandeur in the largest screen possible.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","hariish","12 June 2023","The film had 3hr run time and failed to resolve any conflicts that the previous film had kept it open. This film is a visual masterpiece other than that it simply fails in everyway. How convenient bringing the Antagonist back in the Avatar form just for the revenge plot? He has a Son out of nowhere? And now the scientist had a mysterious kid? Now, let's come to the plot, The Antagonist tries to get his revenge on the Sully's (typical) and Sully suddenly wants to run away from the forest for no reason, Instead of trying to defend it and end the story once and for all? It doesn't matter where he goes, which tribe he goes and live with the results are gonna be the same (Either Humans win or Sully wins). I don't understand the point of running away, that incredibly slows down the film and everything feels like a filler.Even at the conclusion did they try to put an end to the conflicts? NO. It just ended with what we had in part 1. Absolute filler of a Movie.","

The movie delivers to the viewers exactly what if wants, a cinematic experience. It doesn't take long before you get dragged into the movie and bond with the characters. The overall CGI is just breathtaking beautiful and sometimes you even forget that you are watching a computer generated world.Some negative aspects of the movie are the (again) stereotypical villains, simple storyline and repetitive concept from the first part.Overall, a must watch.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","breneff","19 December 2022","I love this movie a lot. I personally feel like the action and the special effects are way better than they were in the first movie. I also like the darker vibe it takes towards the last half. With that being said the story overall is very convoluted. Especially with the amount of characters that are in the movie. Sometimes the characters do things without any explanation and it feels more like shock value then something the character would actually do and it's hard to connect with them. But overall it was an extremely fun movie and I have never seen visuals like this in my entire life. You definitely need to experience it in the theater. Also the villain Quaritch is the best part of the movie. I am looking forward to the next one though. I feel like there's going to be a lot less set up in the third movie and it's going to be a much more enjoyable story. But for me personally I loved the underwater stuff and I really genuinely cared about the message more in this one. I think that's what James Cameron cares about more is that you connect more of the message than you do with the characters.","

I think that was the most surprising thing, that the story kept moving at a nice pace. Especially for a 3 hour+ movie. The action was phenomenal, the story satisfying and warm. Jake and neytiri as parents is wonderful. We watched in 3d and I felt like maybe it was lacking some color-I want to watch it in regular vision as the colors were one of my favorite parts of the original. I'm a lover of the water so seeing the sully family adapt to the way of the water was a treat. A must see for any avatar fan.

Sam and Zoe now have 4 children-2 boys & 2 girls-and they are living as a family on Pandora. Sigourney and Stephen both return, and yes, they died in the first movie but it is explained how they are here now. Sigourney plays one of Sam's girls-and I know how that sounds but like I said, it is explained. Stephen is still wanting to kill Sam and is tearing up the forests trying to do so. Sam and family go on the run and end up hiding out on some islands with tribes that live their lives based on water. Kate is one of the rulers of the water people and tries to teach Sam, Zoe and their kids how to survive and become members of their water clan. The water people communicate with sea life and use their hair like the forest people did with the flying dragons in the first movie, only with sea creatures. Stephen is still in pursuit and the film ends with a climatic battle. The underwater scenes are great and the actors did a tremendous job.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action, language and partial nudity and has a running time of 3 hours & 12 minutes.If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this installment. I did and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

So I gave 3 star to this movie, 2 stars belongs to good visual effects and one star belongs to the great nap that I had during this movie. I think this movie even could be just 1 hour. I remember when I was awake a kid was fooling around with a giant fish for a long time maybe for 20min and a girl was connecting her cable to different creatures. I can not believe how this creative team made this boring movie which didn't have a good storyline and it was a real cliche. But the visual effects was good.Sweet dream 👍🏻","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","IPyaarCinema","18 December 2022","James Cameron, the mastermind behind the epic story of Avatar and its sequel, already revealed the story in the trailers itself. Still, he makes the movie a great experience to watch with his outstanding characterizations and screenplay. Avatar: The Way of Water is an epic action-adventure film that rides on the most stunning visual effects - the 'magic' on the screen looks 'real' for the most part and that bears testimony to the spare-no-effort approach of Cameron and his unit - but like its predecessor it incorporates into its phenomenal sweep topics that are both emotionally engaging and thematically on point.The way James connects both parts (movies) is quite good. He gives a neat explanation and makes things easier for people to understand the connections between the first and second parts. The way he connected some of the key characters from the first part made the film an emotional experience. The beauty of Avatar 2 is not only the Navi people but also the creatures they love. James Cameron shows the emotional bond between the giant creatures called Tulkun and Navi clan in a beautiful manner.The screenplay is a bit slow but it is all to make the proceedings better. Coming to the camerawork, the background score, and sound design, the film has everything perfect to give viewers a spectacular experience. The VFX is just mindblowing. Coming to performances, it's the children who performed well. Their innocence, fighting spirit and zeal to learn new things have been showcased in a good manner. Kiri and Neteyam will leave a solid impression on us once we leave the theater.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","sydmwswy","29 December 2022","Pandora is created for the first time in this movie. While before this, it was just a beautiful visual idea. Pandora is created for the first time in this film, not because of Cameron's tough filmmaking style. Rather, it is the emotion that create it. Yes, it is the emotion that make Pandora. After Aliens 1986 and Terminator 1984, this movie is Cameron's hardest and toughest movie. This movie is a great work that a tough filmmaker makes up with emotions. The world of Avatar is readable, not too complicated. But it takes form. Avata 2 ' s special effects are not just an invention. Rather, it serves the story.. it serves the characters.. it serves the mise en scene. .... Jake sully and his wife are paid again and are not just big stars of a simple romantic standard level of payment.It seems that here the filmmaker should not refer his story to a film of the first part, but James Cameron explains everything with the focus he has in filmmaking during short impressions.This movie is much better than the first part because here we are not going to go through a very long and boring introduction about a multi-line story. This movie starts from the first moments.The dialogues are not on air. In this film, the director has become an expert in the world of his film and remarkably innovatively creates a very good interaction between action and adventure. It can be very difficult to formalize the plot of a traditional story better than this.I have a nostalgia with the special effects of the first part of this movie (only with its special effects), but that does not make me want to prefer the first part. The difficulty of this movie is like aliens. And I have never seen its softness in Cameron's films.","

The difference from its predecessor being that the focus feels forcefully transported from the forest to the ocean just to show off the underwater motion capture technology they waited so long to mature, yet better capture technology still could not cover up the distracting flaws from bad facial acting. The storyline flaws from the last movie, unfortunately, seemed to be exemplified from being cliché to straight up illogical and self-repeating; and the movie should no longer rely solely on the immersive visuals to stand as a landmark movie.","

Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.","

Other than those 3D visuals, and weird looking animated characters, there is literally nothing in this movie. Back in 2009, it was great deal, even with a below average movie. But today with all the marvel and DC, it feels boring and me giving 6 out 10. I am being over generous. It reminds me of a Hindi Saying Which I have mentioned in the title. James Cameron is just exploiting his name or trust that he earned over the years with movies like Terminator, Terminator 2, Titanic, Avatar etc. He is using his name and brand to make us waste our money on the cr***y sequels of his old successful movies. In span of 4 years, he disappointed me twice, once with Terminator: Dark fate and then again today with Avatar: Way of Water. His fan base is now his pension fund. Best of luck to him!!!","

I'm a huge fan of the first Avatar movie, it's such a focused story, with a begining, middle and end that all make sense and make the viewer feel good, and this sequel does not have anything close to that.So let's rip this stinker up, shall we? (no spoilers, but then again there is no story, so...)the Navi can now talk telepathically with some animals, no hair connection thingy needed! And the conversations are like the ones you would have with a human: ""so how's it going?"" ""meh, you know, can't complain"". Awesome stuff.the story does not develop at all: what you see in the beginning of the movie is exactly how things end up in the end, minus some shallow characters deaths, who don't matter at allthere's hardly any humans around. Now this is really important, because in the first movie they always went back and forth with the Humans / Navi body swapping and so you always felt a (human) connection. In this movie the screentime is 99% focused on the Navi, so it's hard to feel any connection to these characters.there's no expansion of stuff from the first movie, like Eiwa, or the connection between Avatar and human mind, all interesting subjects that should have been exploredyou will get hours of underwater footage and spiritual quotes that only made me fall asleep: ""the ocean is with you"" ""you are one with the ocean"" bla bla bla, just move on with the story, will you?!I haven't had such a big disappoinment in years, and coming from Cameron, the guy who is definitely my favorite director of all times.Needless to say I won't be eager to watch the next sequels: ""Avatar 3 the sway of wind"" with some more memorable quotes: ""the air is allaround you... no wait that was a fart"".Lousy experience.","

This time around JC is building a bigger world knowing there will be at least one more movie so there was a lot left undone and in doing so made the movie feel incomplete.JC is using Pandora as the backdrop to a larger family drama. I enjoyed the first one better but after letting the second sit and stew for a few days I can see there is more to the story and a lot was left unsaid. Such as Kira. Her story fascinated me but was left unresolved in this chapter. I hope in the 3rd film they go further into her connection to Aywa and her mother.","

Movie Review ;The master of cinematic grandeur, James Cameron, is back with another banger, Avatar: The Way of Water. Avatar (2009).

Someone wants to bet against him for a sequel? Think again. You'll have to slap yourself. ""Aliens"" (1986; the prequel was by Ridley Scott, though), ""Terminator 2"" (1991, a groundbreaking sequel to his own groundbreaking classic), and now ""Avatar 2,"" Cameron hits a Hat Trick of fulfilling sequels. The first generation of cinema lovers told us about grandeur in films like ""A Trip To The Moon"" (1902), ""Cabiria"" (1914), ""Napolean"" (1927), ""Metropolis"" (1927), and ""Cleopatra"" (1934), the next generation told us about ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), the next group was mad about ""Star Wars"" (1977), ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Jurassic Park"" (1991), and then came the generation of ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" of which somehow I was part. Now I'll tell my next generation about the magnificent visual phenomenon of Avatar: The Way of Water.Avatar: The Way of Water takes place a decade after the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) are living together, but they are a family of six now. They have two sons, one daughter, and one adopted daughter (of Dr. Grace) and continue to fight the sky people to prevent Pandora. Colonel Miles Quaritch's resurrected avatar (Stephen Lang) seeks vengeance on Jake and Neytiri and is willing to go to any length to get it. As the threat becomes more dangerous, Jake decides to leave Pandora and migrate with his family. The Sullys take shelter at the waterland called Metkayina, ruled by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife, Ronal (Kate Winslet). Will Jake and his family manage to stop the Sky People by running away like this? Avatar: The Way of Water is all about this epic battle.Somehow, I have always believed that Cameron's high-budget films are not about good stories. Be it Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, or Avatar, they all had sort of decent stories, but yes, the ideas were brilliant. Cameron's extraordinary vision and unseen kind of visualisation always had us drooling. Avatar 2 isn't a great script, just like its predecessor, but I bet you can show me a more visually stunning experience. I know you can't, because there aren't any. The visual hysteria of Avatar (2009) has remained unbeaten for 13 years, only because James Cameron was busy making Avatar 2. I just can't imagine what would have happened if he had succeeded in cracking those groundbreaking non-glasses 3D effects. I wouldn't have left the auditorium then, I guess. The family is expanded here and so are emotions. Avatar 2 employs the same trick that Cameron employed in Avatar, and some of its elements may remind you of the first film. It's like the same treatment again, but in a different world. Avatar had Pandora and too many humans, while The Way of Water has too much water and fewer humans. Believe me, Metkayina is more spectacular than Pandora. You can drop your thousand bucks for the ticket purchase now.It's difficult to judge the performances of avatars, as they are such rare creatures that you don't see often. Something that bothers me while reviewing animated and other artificial films, too. Here, it's sort of a mix, and the actors have really had to put in extra effort to showcase avatars as humans. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaa, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, Brendan Cowell, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald have put their souls into making the characters look real. But anyway, who watches Avatar films for acting? Who are we kidding?Avatar: The Way of Water's biggest USP is its existence on the big screen. If you can really divide films into a new theme called ""visual masterpieces,"" then Avatar: The Way of Water is that film and the table topper too. I had to pinch myself a couple of times to believe that it was happening for real on the big screen. The visualisation is simply outstanding. Even the word ""outstanding"" doesn't do it justice. It looks impossible that someone can really create such a world and keep you amazed for three hours with so many amazing visuals. How can I name one or two? It's like a house full of surprises, and you just can't help loving every single moment on screen. You know, I have wondered why people make films in 3D when you can't show the 3D effects throughout the film. A genius like Nolan knew it, so he didn't make 3D films. Instead, he went for IMAX and created a visual spectacle. Other directors weren't that smart, but Cameron was living in a whole different world. He knew people couldn't watch two or three hours of film with glasses on because you couldn't offer every single second in 3D format. So, he created an unknown world that can only be viewed in 3D.Avatar: The Way of Water will leave you speechless with its astonishing spectacle. Something that you can't imagine. Only James Cameron can. Dear Jim, what soil are you made of? How do you manage to leave us in awe with your vision every single time? When was the last time this man disappointed us? Talk about visual effects and theatrical experience, and I'd say Avatar 2 is magnificent, fantastic, outstanding, crazy, insane, amazing, miraculous, unbelievable, and what not. Just assume every superlative word that comes to your mind. The way James has mixed those 30 fps and 60 fps frameworks is the greatest example of cinematic majesty. If you understand what it is, then you'll be blown away by it. The cinematography, the background score, the crystal-clear 3D effects, the sound design, the screenplay, and Cameron's extraordinary vision will all force you to stand up and clap for the entire team of Avatar: The Way of Water. Yet another groundbreaking visual phenomenon by master Camron-that's the least I can say. Don't miss the biggest motion picture event of our generation, no matter what the ticket costs. An IMAX 3D or 4DX experience will take you to another world for sure.RATING - 7/10*","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","liajames","16 December 2022","I don't often leave reviews, but I had to get my thoughts down after just seeing a showing for this sequel. I'm a huge James Cameron fan. I remember hyping up the first film to practically everyone I met weeks and months before it's release. ""It's James Cameron!"" I would say to them excitedly.And I loved that film and have watched it many times since its release.There are serious problems with this sequel though (and I'm starting to suspect that Disney outright owns professional critics at this point.)The plot is paper thin. The film opens as humans unceremoniously return to Pandora. They just arrive in a fleet of ships, and their plan is no longer to obtain unobtainium - they want to relocate / populate Pandora because Earth is dying. Now, the environmental themes of the first film were well handled; they were subtextual and the plot and characters spoke of them and represented them well. Here, the message is practically shouted straight into the camera. It's very heavy-handed, and it's not good science fiction - it's the same old doomerism that you'll find on any typical angsty subreddit about the future.Colonel Quaritch (the main villain from the first film,) is just dropped into the film via cloning in the space of about five minutes. How did he get his memories back? Oh, they just downloaded a copy from the original Quaritch. No deep science fiction backstory here, just your basic run-of-the-mill copy, and now he wants revenge. A character that was an interesting foe in the first film (if a little bombastic,) here becomes a silly one-dimensional bad guy. And he survives the ending, which he shouldn't have; this villain is not compelling enough to push these characters through more sequels.After the first act, Jake and Neytiri are largely pushed aside as the film focuses on the children. For the most part it's a very family-friendly film, and then towards the end there are sequences and fight scenes that are decidedly not family-friendly. The kids are not interesting in the slightest, except for Kiri. She has a connection with Grace and Eywa that isn't fully explained, and she develops supernatural powers which aren't discussed by any of the other characters. They just sort of happen. I get why they happen; she has a connection with Eywa, but the whole arc is just left hanging by the end, and presumably we have to come back for the sequel to find out what happens with her.The death of one of the siblings felt borderline exploitative. Cameron's insistence (as another reviewer mentioned,) on pushing the nuclear family agenda doesn't really work well in these times. It works for him because he's very wealthy, to be frank, but it doesn't work for a lot of young people these days. I was already wary of that going into the film, and that trepidation was justified. I can't relate to this guy with a gaggle of children, who, frankly, I don't think should be having children at all. I don't see Jake Sully as a father.The new Mcguffin will have you rolling your eyes for certain. Did you think unobtanium was bad? OK, here we go. I've always defended James Cameron's films, and I defended the choice to use the descriptor ""unobtanium"" in the first film. Why? I could find several reasons: none of the main characters really care about it for starters. They have other concerns. Grace love's the N'avi and Pandora, Jake is not a scientist, Selfridge is a corporatist etc. The ones who care about the actual chemical name are back on earth waiting for this valuable superconducting material (and, yes, a room temperature superconductor would be that valuable.) Plus, it is a term that physicists have used in the past to describe incredibly powerful substances that they just don't have.In this film, we're introduced to a substance inside the brains of whales that prolongs human lifespan. Yes, you read that correctly. That's the unobtanium of this film, and it's only mentioned once. But apparently it's worth 80 million $ a bottle. I mean, the year is approximately 2170 at this point. If mankind doesn't have longevity and anti-aging treatments already, and needs to hunt space whales for it... well, I'm sorry but this makes no damn sense.It's BAD SCIENCE FICTION, and It's bad writing.The film will remind you repeatedly that you're watching a sequel to Avatar. From repeating lines verbatim from the first film (this must happen about ten times!) to using identical musical cues for similar scenes.It's basically an hour of great action and two hours of splashing around with whales and various other water animals, while Jake continuously scolds his children for being bold. And James Cameron wants you to know that whales are beautiful animals that are viciously mistreated. Yes, we're aware Mr. Cameron. There's very little the general film-going public can do about it though. I sure wish I had a fridge filled with vegan snacks on the go. If I did, I'd be vegan. But then again, I don't have half a billion dollars in my bank account. Most people barely have time to pay their bills, so your message is largely falling on deaf ears, even though you're shouting now.4 stars for Sigourney Weaver and the VFX (Weta) people. You worked hard and deserve all the accolades you get. Visually, it's a gorgeous film. But I have no idea what Cameron was going for with this shallow, paint by numbers sequel. I'm done with Avatar.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","deboraey","21 May 2023","AVATAR THE WAY OF THE WATER shows viewers a magnificent water world with all sorts of beautiful majestic creatures, and also has some superb action scenes that are really quite stunning.But once stated this, her's my final ordeal: it is a very bad and shallow movie, empty, hollow, and in a way extremely boring and even depressing!It is a huge disappointment because, in spite of all the (extremely well-done!) CGI and spectacle, the movie after some 30 minutes becomes quite boring and eventually really really sucks on the whole!Ultimately a movie first of all depends on the storytelling. And let's face it the story is terrible and extremely shallow - it could have been written by an 5 year old. A great deal of the script simply makes no sense at all, and there are also numerous plot holes.If there is going to be an AVATAR 3 . . . Don't count on me!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","NinaCarla","22 January 2023","Pros:
Pretty, very pretty.Addresses some important issues of diversity.3D was used nicely, although could've been more regular.Cons:
Overly long. I was prepared for the length but found my mind drifting from the beginning and completely zoning out in the last half an hour.Weirdly boring and repetitive despite the stunning visuals and constant action.Despite exploring issues of diversity, women were secondary, supportive characters.Didn't add anything to the first. Just a re-telling of the same conflict.Overall:
A nice experience but could've been meaningful, interesting and enjoyable if it focussed on a proper narrative. There were so many surplus scenes about so many things, I was left numb.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","cherold","7 April 2023","This is the first line of Avatar, Way of Water:
""The forests of Pandora hold many dangers ...........
but the most dangerous thing about Pandora is that ..........
you can grow to love her too much.""That is embarrassingly bad. I mean, when I googled to find that line I discovered there are people who think it's great, but it's just ... not.But it's pretty typical of the bad writing of his film.Way of Water takes up where the last entertaining but forgettable movie left off, with the Na'vi forced to once again confront the evil, violent, resource-scavenging humans.The plotting is weak - the main family moves for reasons that make absolutely zero sense, so everything that unfolds after is the result of sheer stupidity. But then, everyone else makes stupid decisions too, which is the only way this movie keep going (and going, and going, and going - how can a movie with so little story be so loooooooooooong).I suppose if you watched this in 3D in the theater the visuals were so overwhelming that they balanced out the bad storytelling, but I watched it on TV. But I would argue that a movie that's only good in 3D is not a good movie.There are some good things in this movie. Even in 2D the visuals are often stunning and the creature and environmental design are wildly imaginative. I liked the story thread of the girl connecting mystically with her new environment. And the action is well done and builds to big, over-the-top finish (although once again there's lots of stupidity, with some characters seemingly going out of their way to get killed for no good reason).The worst thing about this movie is the Academy embarrassed itself by nominating it for an Oscar for no other reason than it made lots of money.I'm tempted to say, ""if I had to do it over again I would watch it in the theater,"" except would I really pay prohibitive movie prices to watch an overlong, mediocre movie simply for the effects? I don't know.Perfectly watchable and very scenic, but it's a shame that with all that money the producers couldn't be bothered to do the minimum to make a genuinely compelling movie with engaging characters.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Izzy129","14 December 2022","I'm a huge Avatar fan. I have seen the first movie many times. Avatar is a masterpiece in my eyes.I went into it thinking I was gonna have the same experience as the first one. The visuals/cgi are once again the best I've ever seen and there were a lot of things I loved.However, the story fell flat.Here's the things I disliked.The middle of the movie felt like a teenage drama movie. I mean the way the Navi kids bullied Jake's children felt like straight out of some teenage high school movie. I get that they are similar to humans in that way, but it really brought me out of the immersion. It could have been handled differently.The use of words like ""bro"" was absolutely ridiculous. I get that they learned it from Jake, but it doesn't fit and once again brought me out of the immersion.A lot of the characters lacked depth and personality. Kiri was my favorite new character, but Loak and Neteyam felt so one dimensional. Loak's only character traits is that he ""doesn't fit in"" despite acting like a typical teenage boy. I wanted him to have more personality, and I hope he does in the future movies.The anti whaling message was too in your face, and the more I rewatch it the more obvious it gets. Once again it brought me out of the immersion. The scene with the whale just feels like it goes on for so long. The Australian captain felt like some one dimensional cartoon villain.Jake and Neytiri basically dissappear from the movie during the whole middle part. There's just way too little scenes with them.This was almost exactly the same story as the first movie. I don't mind them bringing back the villain and I actually ended up liking that choice and how they gave him more depth.But there's nothing complex or new about the storyline in this movie. I'm telling myself that this is only part 2 out of 5 movies, and I really hope that the story becomes more complex in the next movies and that the characters are given more depth. As of right now I only care about Jake, Neytiri and Kiri. I want Neytiri and Jake to be given more scenes because I really haven't been given a reason to root for Loak. I'm sorry but he feels like every teenage boy I've ever met.I just felt like this movie was lacking the magic that the first one had.It felt more like a movie made for kids and teenagers.Avatar 2 feels like a huge set up for what's to come, and I am excited for the next movie. I just hope that James listens to the criticism and makes some changes, this could be an amazing movie series if done right and I'm sad to see my favorite movie get a sequel that doesn't come close to the magic of the first one. The first movie was absolutely magic, and I hope the next movie goes back to that.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","misrael-1","20 December 2022","I enjoyed the first Avatar when it came out, so I thought I'd enjoy this one as well. It seems they worked really hard on showing the audience how much they've improved the cgi, but in the process forgot to work on the story.I left the theatre shaking my head knowing that no matter how pedestrian the storyline was, people will be impressed at the graphics and it will sell millions of tickets anyway, leading Cameron to believe he did a stellar job. Then he will unleash the more Avatars on us.The first movie is remembered fondly because none of us had seen anything like it before. Nowadays we aren't as dazzled by cgi because it's everywhere, and a movie needs a good plot as well to stand the test of time. I think this will go down in history as a successful movie, but not one you need to see more than once.","

I'm almost 50 so grew up on James Cameron's movies, loved most of them, but this was in your face humans bad, everything else good. A lot doesn't make sense and why would similar animals on another planet sound like those on our planet. The visuals still dont look real, they still look like CGI, they are excellent but had been over hyped. Once the Navi and other creatures look like they are real then I will be impressed. I bought this on Amazon prime thinking I'd love it as much as the first which I saw numerous times in 2009 and and after, this one was enough viewing once only.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","keeranilchouhan","15 February 2023","First of all never doubt James Cameron.Avatar: The Way of Water is Came out on 16th of December 2022,this is a beautifully stunning, bigger, better & more emotional than the first one.In this new three-hour movie, James Cameron can turn any viewer into a big fan of his own franchise, who are eagerly waiting for the next movies. The movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is considered as a new beginning for this franchise and Cameron was able to further develop the script and characters and remove the weakness of the first movie. He has also created one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences.Plot-wise, Avatar 2 is just a remake of its sibling. But add 10 years effort of one of the most talented directors, boom, we are pulled into a magic world.Watch it in IMAX 3D, even if it means you must take half a day leave from your work. It provides out of the world experience, literally.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots. Avatar 2 is entertaining the whole way through and I really recommend seeing this at the movies especially in 3D. I will watch every Avatar James Cameron makes.As James Cameron prepared his sequels to his mega-success Avatar, one of the more intriguing aspects of the production was that Stephen Lang, who played the first film's villain, Colonel Miles Quaritch, would be returning for Avatar: The Way of Water and the rest of the franchise.Review by: Anil Chouhan.","

JakeSully gets hunted of the angry Skypeople and seek refuge amongst the water people, who are just really boring. Then after 1 hour of CGI spectacle, there is a battle. Of course the human who are now in the space age is just supremely awful at war, JakeSully's wife takes down like 5 helicopters with her bow, I mean omg, what is this child movie? It's not really exciticing when the main antagonist is just beyond useless. The Navi do some kind of frontal assuault, there are like hundres of humans with guns and like MGLs and 2, maybe 3 Navi dies. On the other side, hundreds of humans dies, some kind of monster hoover craft gets destroyed along side some battle ships. It just no excitiment at all, knowing the the protaganist will get through this, barely with a scratch. In the end, what happend?

Because even though it didn't predict me as a scenario and story, I knew that I was going to watch a visually magnificent movie. I don't like watching 3D movies, but this movie should definitely be watched in 3D. They shot very well.Also, of course, the effects, cgi were simply perfect. Acting was very good.

"Avatar: The Way of Water","daredevilx90","22 April 2023","""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by the original film. While the movie boasts stunning visuals and a unique underwater world, it lacks the emotional depth and compelling storyline that made the first film so memorable.The biggest issue with ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is its lackluster storyline. The plot is thin and predictable, with little to no character development. The film relies heavily on clichéd tropes and predictable twists, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and uninvested in the outcome.Another problem with the movie is its pacing. The movie is slow and meandering, with scenes that drag on for too long and fail to move the story forward. The underwater scenes are beautiful, but they can also be overwhelming and repetitive, leaving the audience feeling numb rather than immersed in the story.The characters in ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" are also disappointing. Despite the efforts of the talented cast, the characters are one-dimensional and lack the depth and complexity of those in the original film. Even the villain is cartoonish and uninteresting, with no real motivation or backstory to make them compelling.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a lackluster sequel that fails to capture the magic and emotional resonance of the first film. While it may appeal to fans of the original for its stunning visuals and familiar world-building, it ultimately falls short in terms of storytelling and character development.""","

It's the same old cheesy story of ""Good nature people living in paradise under attack from evil sadistic colonialists"". There's nothing new, nothing surprising, the movie is predictable from beginning to end. If you know the first one, you know this one too. The biggest problem is that the simple story is stretched to 3 hours! I felt bored a lot and was glad when the movie was finally over.A lot of the reviews here argue ""Well, the story is boring but the visuals made up for it"". To be honest, I wasn't blown away by the visuals either. Most of the movie looks computer animated, like a video game. Nice yeah, but it really doesn't look like there's a 13 years difference to the first Avatar. It's not as stunning as back then.I definitely won't watch a third Avatar. To me, the first Avatar was stunning for the time back then, but the second one was an uneccessary sequel to print some money.I can't believe it has an IMBD rating of 7.8.When you look at the written reviews, the average rating is definitely lower, closer to 5 to 6.","

RECOMMENDEDThe first two things comes in my mind: Positive one, the movie and making takes us to their world and I really lived three hours in their world. Thanks to IMAX and great 3D experience
The negative one: There are lot of moments reiterated from the first part. Lot of scenes looks like first part sequences remade in water world with more technical excellence.I was stunned and had lot of jaw dropping moments in first part. Compared to that one, this one has less. At the same time this is not less in class and mass.The beginning and end has superb action sequences, in between there are more sentiments and taking viewer slowly into the new world from Pandora.See it in Imax with 3d to live their world.","

From that day onwards i was waiting for the 2nd film to hit the theater and watching Avatar the way of water on the very first day is an experience on itself. The visuals as usual is stunning and some scenes we literally out of this world. The 3D really utilizes our peripheral vision because some scenes i felt the characters are coming from the far corner. The story is emotionally attached to the place and we overserves will be involved and will feel like we are there watching the whole thing unfold before our eyes. The music, the sounds of everything happening are top notch and i could go on explaining how great everything was. But for now go enjoy this visual masterpiece of a movie for you self. The direction of Cameron, the performance of the cast, the effort from the whole visual effects team pays off in this long movie that is full on engaging and entertaining.","

I looked forward to a second film that would offer further stunning innovation, especially considering the long interval between the two films. Unfortunately, that implied promise wasn't met.

How was my overall experience?Ans. Pretty nice, barring the unsophisticated group of people who sat just behind me, it was all satisfactory. Watching it in 3D does add up a lot to the all-around experience.Q. How does it compare against the Original? Is it better or worse?Ans. Many might disagree, but I would still choose the first part over this sequel. Despite this having an abundance of jaw-dropping visuals and some excellent world-building, the first one delivers a better narrative on the whole.Q. Speaking of Story, does the length of almost three and a half hours becomes overbearing?Ans. At times, yes! Especially in the second act where they have taken an excessive amount of time to build up the world around and under the waters and in there the slower editing does take a toll on its momentum. Now If you are well accustomed to prolonged screenwriting, you would have no issue whatsoever sitting through this whole thing, or else, be prepared, now you can't say, you didn't get your warning.Q. Tell me something about the performances and the characters!Ans. Each one of the actors performed to the very best of their abilities, But for me, it was the kids who had stolen the show! Especially Kiri (voiced by Sigourney Weaver); she was amazing.Q. Lastly, do I recommend this feature?Ans. Yes, absolutely, this is a cinematic marvel, one that is supposed to be witnessed on the biggest screen, one that shouldn't be missed.","

James Cameron did a better job directing this movie than the first movie he directed 13 years . The cgi still looks the same as 2009 13 years ago . The story takes place after the humans go back to earth and Jake stays on Pandora to spend his life with Neytiri and raise his family. The kids we're so awesome and the blue reef Navis we're even more cooler . Kate winslet hasn't worked with Cameron since the 90s after playing rose in titanic. But seeing her play a sea Navi was more exciting than titanic 25 years ago . Sigourney weaver did a remarkable job playing graces Navi daughter and I for one found that pretty well done and kinda of emotional . Stephen lang did an even better job playing quaritch in Navi form was absolutely brilliant and a better story for the villain. I have to say way of water was so amazing and more exciting than ever before. The kids were more important to the story than the parents were . Spider who was the coIonels son knew that trusting a bad man was not his place . I hope in the next avatar movie I see Parker and more places to go on Pandora and hopefully Neytiri meets one of her half siblings or cousins and they share the same plot as Jake sully . Or maybe just maybe they'res another family member on Pandora that has the same genes as Jake sully .James Cameron welcome back to Pandora.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","tvedukr","22 December 2022","I had an option to watch this in ICE 3D and Imax 3D. But went for later, didn't want to experiment with the new technology. But now if I get a chance want to experience this cinematic beauty in ICE 3D too.Let's get straight to the point, this is James Cameron film, you will obviously see lot of water, the guy has put in everything he has learned over the years form his films. I personally didn't feel any lag, the progression was great. But some would say he spent lot of unnecessary time showing underwater scenes; but for me every single minute was a bliss, it defined the emotions and the feelings.I've read somewhere, one of the editors of the films said it raw. When they showed the first cut version to James; he became furious and told them to put every damn 190 minute of the film back; this is James for you.It's been 13yrs since the first Avatar, and hence this had to stand to the experience we had with the first one. With all the latest technologies; there was something new we all needed, and it was present in this.Coming to plot, yes it's a very simple plot. Nothing new, family is more important; they stay together, fight together. This I'm telling in simple words, but James will make you emotional watching it on screen.Definitely there are some plot holes, I won't write it here, then it's a major spoiler. But Avatar 2 stands for itself than one; it's a buildup for the 3rd.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","kjproulx","18 December 2022","The day has finally arrived. It has been 13 years since the release of Avatar and while I still love that film and was eager for a sequel, for many years I just didn't believe it was happening. Well, those thoughts can now take a back seat. Avatar: The Way of Water is now playing in theatres and this sequel to the biggest film of all time is the better of the two movies, and as I said, I still love the first. Here's why you should check this one out if you liked the first.Set many years after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the family he has created with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Their four kids are just as central to the story of this film as they are. When the ""sky people"" known as humans return for a new reason that I will leave out of this review, Jake and his family flock to a new tribe to request shelter. This is where they meet the Na'vi of the Metkayina Clan of the ocean of Pandora. This group teaches the Sully family how to live, breathe, and thrive underwater. Once the looming threat comes looking for them though, the Metkayina Clan are also caught in the crossfire. I'll hold off on diving in deeper because I don't want to ruin who returns and how it all plays out.Obviously, without question, many people will be going to see this film for the visual feast alone. The visuals in this film put the first film to shame and that film still holds up visually in my opinion. Seeing Avatar: The Way of Water in IMAX 3D was almost too much for my eyes at times. The work here is astonishing to say the least. I will recommend not seeing this film with high frame rate though, which is how I saw it. Most cinema websites will list that as HFR. I truly believe that motion ruins the viewing experience of anything. But yes, this film deserves all the awards when it comes to the visuals, it's simply breathtaking.What I enjoyed most about this film is the fact that there is a lot more world building here and the idea of Eywa was much more interesting here. The character that Sigourney Weaver returns to play, Kiri, has the most fascinating storyline in relation to that. The rest of the Sully family was all enjoyable as well. I really liked Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) because he was an angsty teenager and also just wanted to do the right thing for his family. On top of that, his sequences invoking the ocean and his bond with a whale blew me away. My favourite new character though has to be Spider (Jack Champion). He is the only human hanging out with the Na'vi and his energy made for a very likeable character.In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water is the most beautiful film I've seen in a theatre in years. At over three hours, I didn't mind how the film was paced at all, but my one small complaint is that it treads some of the same story beats of the first film. In many ways, this sequel is just a better version of the first film. James Cameron has proven that he has a bigger story to tell and this film is pretty much the jumping off point. It reintroduces you to all of the characters, introduces new faces, provides some brilliant ideas, and then it all comes to an end. I'm very eager to see where this story goes next. Now playing in theatres, if you liked Avatar back in 2009, I can't recommend Avatar: The Way of Water enough. I loved watching this film so much that I'm just going to give it the highest score I can. It's not my favourite film of all time or anything like that, but it impressed the hell out of me.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","martoka_z","4 March 2023","When I heard negative reviews of the movie and saying that's way too long .... I was perplexed as I thought no way Avatar movie with it's visually amazing world and charismatic characters could be long! I loved the first Avatar and really wanted to dive into this magic world once again, the more, the longer the better!!!!But here I am, just watched it in the theater ... And while I was sitting there and watching the movie I realized what people meant! There really could be too much of the Avatar, especially when the storyline is not that catchy. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are amazing, but I had a feeling that the directors focus was on the visuals, show more and show it in a more creative, visually beautiful way and unnecessary stretching this visuals shots and the movie as a result!In regards to the story itself, I don't get it!!! To my understanding Jake Sully decides to leave (read abandon) HIS people in the middle of the war and run/hide to save his family??? And what about the responsibility of the leader of the people??? (I don't buy the they are safer without me justification! - they are still fighting, and he is the most skilled at war with the army people). Then he hides with water people and basically brings the war to them, threatening their own peace and existence ... and then at the end he decides to lead them to war???? I honestly don't get the logic!!!","

Spider is the colonels son? Oh who is his Mother then? Daughter has epilepsy and is the scientists daughter oh who is the father? This is out of this world script writing unbelievably and far fetched story lines. To put a big mother ship on the island of Pandora at the start of the movie only to not be seen again? Near the end as well they are all charging the baddy and then what happens? Us viewers just expected to make up what happens next? Get a good script writer for this next movie please. Can't be much worse.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","kratan","14 December 2022","To be frank, I was certainly disappointed with the trailer of this movie. I even thought of carrying a pill, because watching a boring plot in 3D for more than 3 hours would be a perfect recipe for headache.Oh man, James Cameron proved me wrong, in most pleasant way.Plot-wise, Avatar 2 is just a remake of its sibling. But add 10 years effort of one of the most talented directors, boom, we are pulled into a magic world.Watch it in IMAX 3D, even if it means you must take half a day leave from your work. It provides out of the world experience, literally.Word of caution: clear your tank, carry enough snacks.. story-wise, you can miss any scene without losing the track. But it would look super weird when you come out of the water world, and step into the rest room :-)","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","arungeorge13","29 March 2023","Thematically, Avatar: The Way of Water has a lot in common with that of other James Cameron films. The Sully family is bigger and stronger than ever, and each of Jake's and Neytiri's offspring carry distinct traits. I'm glad Cameron tapped the writing duo of Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver to pen the screenplay alongside him. They're the kind of writers who can handle spectacle while keeping the film's emotional core intact throughout the 185-minute runtime. Sufficient screentime is spent establishing the strengths and weaknesses of the Sullys, while the Metkayina clan who comes to their aid, is painted in broader strokes.Needless to say how incredible the visual effects are here - Weta FX has done a spectacular job coming up with an avant-garde style of motion capture - given that much of the film takes place in and around water. I'm really hoping we get to see some of the sequels in ""glasses-free 3D"", as Cameron remarked. To say that my eyes were overwhelmed by different shades of blue, is an understatement. As the title suggests, the best scenes in the film are the ones underwater. Simon Franglen takes over from (the late) James Horner, and much of his original score is thankfully retained.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","mhorg2018","15 June 2023","I liked the first Avatar. I felt it was too long (like this one) and the story was very basic. This is more of the same. It's clear Cameron loves his creation, but the human characters are weak and evil for the most, while 99 percent of the Navi are noble and good. It's really more of a the evil expanding west and the noble savages, a story that's been done before. The major flaws are; so Earth (which is dying, an old, old trope in SF) has all this technology and they can't find another planet? Humans can't even breath the Pandoran atmosphere, but they're going to invade and transplant humanity? All that tech and they can't terraform mars or venus? Can't find another habitable world? Of course then, there won't be a story. And, if we look at human history, natives with spears and bows and arrows ALWAYS win over technology, right? (See: INDIAN WARS, AMERICAN WEST). So, yes, Pandora looks alive (I didn't see it in 3-D) but the story is weak. I lost a lot of respect for Cameron when he put his weight behind the horrible Terminator: Dark Fate, and this hasn't helped. Likely I won't take the 3 1/2 hours of my life this took to ever watch it again.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","ruelshepperd","17 December 2022","The original Avatar is far from a good movie. It's plot and characters are incredibly basic and predictable yet people loved it for its visuals, action and soundtrack. It was the highest bar for VFX. Now in our age of CGI action movies, with stronger plots, does the sequel push the boundary for VFX and CG. The answer is a resounding yes. It's the new gold standard.Avatar: The Way of Water is the best looking film I've ever seen. The CG is flawless, the colours and imagery is so vibrant and imaginative and the soundtrack is wonderful. The cinematography is fantastic and really immerses you into the world of Pandora to a level unmatched by any film. But visuals aren't everything, what about the plot and characters.They're surprisingly alright. While the plot is simple, it contains little of the preachy messaging of the original, although it does contain some notable examples of it in the early minutes. This film is more concerned with expanding the world and the characters. Jake feels more fleshed out here, now having to be a father and Sam Worthington gives a stronger performance than the original. All the new characters are captivating too, all excellently performed and animated, especially Kiri, played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver. Colonel Quaritch, the one note antagonist of the previous film, is overall more threatening and emotive than the original and there is clearly potential to flesh him out further in the third entry.The only issues with this film is that sometimes the dialogue and messaging can be as subtle as a brick and there are some instances of Cameron cheaply manipulating the audience into hating the villains. The pacing could've also been smoother as the intro to this movie rushes through a lot of details and I feel that there must be a director's cut of the film that we're missing. However, this film's third act more than makes up for most shortcomings as it is awesome. Visually stunning with great action choreography and stronger investment in the characters. Cameron still shows he can do action better than the rest.Overall, The Way of Water is miles better than it's predecessor and prices CGI isn't an ugly concept that marvel has made everyone despise. With talent and time it can be used to enhance a film tenfold. While it's far from perfect, this sequel actually made me excited for Cameron's later planned films. It's a visual masterpiece that must be seen to be believed.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","fciocca","18 December 2022","""Avatar 2"" is a huge technical achievement and I think that this franchise set new standards in cinema when it comes to CGI and visual effects. Cameron expanded this universe with new sceneries and creatures; he was able to build a brand new world from scratch. I am confident in saying that these movies will hold strong for many, many generations. They used the latest technologies to bring to the audience one of the best visual experiences in the last decades. The different environments, the creatures and the native aliens are just stunning and I do not have anything to remark. I was simply speechless for the whole time. This is a project that involved a lot of resources, but it definitely paid off. This is one of the few films that I was looking forward to watching in the cinema, with a proper sound system. I definitely recommend doing the same, because only in this way you will be able to fully enjoy it. A simple home theater system, for how expensive it could be, it just cannot match the experience.I cannot say that I was particularly impressed by any of the performances, but the general acting level is solid. Unfortunately not all the cast members were up to the task. Spider was pretty annoying and does not add any value to the film. Jack Champion is just really bad in this role. Luckily he is just a side character that has very little screen time. The first and third acts are very similar to the first ""Avatar"" and in my perspective they were very uninspired and predictable. The middle section was the best, and this is where there is the true potential of this movie. The director took the time to develop the lore of this world and its inhabitants. This is my favorite part, as it gives the audience the chance to get familiar with the planet of Pandora. This is definitely a huge recommendation and there is no better way to end this year with this release.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","rgkarim","16 December 2022","Likes:The Acting/Voice Acting
-Not the most award winning, but familiar and just as passionate
-They know how to make cultural expression come to life and sound like a familial tribe that really works
-Worthington is still monotone and stoic, but yet makes it work and keeps the cool soldier/father role works super well for me.-Saldana's ability to sound like an alien tribal cat is impressive, and the raw emotions she rings out are part of the heart ripping moments that will drive a tear
-Weaver has some interesting changes to her voice, able to somewhat mask her voice, but yet adds a familiarity that should give you hints for a twist.-The rest play their parts well and do justice to the Avatar franchise crafting the cultural twist this movie is about.The Pace Mostly
-Uses the three hours quite well to tell a story
-Give you decent amount of information and emersion, but smartly uses time jumps to not get lost.-Handles past and present material very well and manages to keep things easy to follow
-The character stories moving in tandem are again easy to follow and are well-edited to help keep things ingrained.-Moves, but still has the cultural coming of age that works to give you the world building that this series thrives on.-Does well with placement of action, though more is always welcomed, it's placed well to ramp things up and add stakes.The Emotion is Big
-By far made me feel more in my heart than the first one
-Tied to characters and helps elevate the new cast beyond the simple love interests
-Helps establish edge and connection to help care about the characters and their rides and rooting for them to make it through
-Heartbreaking at times, and keeps the established danger that a movie needs to be exciting.-Deeper than the first one and trying to dive further into the minutia that is this series.The Coming Of Age Story At times
-Enjoyed the character development for many of the group, learning more about them and the ties they have to the big picture
-It handles different levels and responsibilities, while giving those quirks to members of the family.-Adds some heat and relationship building that works with the stereotypical interactions that many tribal histories have, alongside learning to establish an interesting dynamic.-Does not magically happen, you see the work and smarter storytelling that does not pull the Hallmark syndrome.-I think is going to be relatable to a lot of people, as the older characters get their own trials to get through, showing attention and care for the series and not just the new generation.The New Cultural Aspect Is Interesting
-Familiar like the first movie, but now moving to a different type of way of life on Pandora
-Not too much of a stretch, a fantastic blend that plays by Pandora's rules, does not break the boundaries, and still is slightly different to work.-Loved the fact that we saw establishments of bonds with nature, the building of family, and touching on cultural qualities without being too in your face.-And works with the story, without getting in the way of the pace for the most part, making for great world building to extend the story.-All while working with the theme of water they promised.The Science
-I'm a sucker for integrating of science to this world and just how amazing they build the world with realistic principles that don't feel too far out there.-The biology and ecology mixing together to make these unique flora and fauna paint a wonderful world to feast your eyes on.The familiarity and anatomy components add that elevated touch, and again makes a platform to once again discover the creativity of the visual department
-The fact it faces modern science vs. Traditional that again plays with the cultures of the two worlds and their approaches to action scenes.The Action To An Extent
-Placed very well, not too much, but also not quickly dropped or skipped out.-They did make sure to give the action it's due time and when the bigger scenes hit, it felt mostly complete and thought out.-The ending fight is big on many levels, and utilizes the world to a great degree that made the first one fun.-Comedic at times to balance out the tones.-A lot more emotional than the first one. Much more justice and character driven punches than the past. One of those emotional stakes moments than straight up combat.The Visuals/Sound Editing
-The best part of this movie, the visuals are gorgeous in how the fiction looks real and moves so well.-Attention to detail in the creatures movement and how lifelike it mirrors the beats they are modeled after, which was incredible to see in how every beast has the lifelike component.-The world is vivid, colorful, but adds so many layers to tell the story, with lighting being a key quality, and yet never gets in the way of seeing the details.-It plays so well with the culture, and the structural architecture is wonderful for how much it pulls the story together.-Sounds add more to the world and don't blow out your eardrums doing it, and I loved that immersion without going deaf.DISLIKES:Over Three Hours Long
-It's long, and at times you might feel it's long if you are seeking more action
-With three more parts coming, why did it need to be that much?-Was there a director's cut coming and if so will it help some of the other limitations?Character Balance Is Not As Level
-The first one did so much with the characters and keeping them integrated, while developing the story.-This film struggles to balance these characters to the same degree and many new people get pushed to the side with favoritism on other characters.-Lots of jumping between the group, with many secondary characters sort of missing that emotional connection to some others meaning weaker relationships.-Planning too much for the other sequels that might transition to more, but in this film is not as deep as I expect.-Zoe Saldana's character is out of it for most of the movie, only really coming back at the end.Predictable for 85%
-Not5 much to go off here, the movie has a lot of foreshadowing that will give off a lot of stuff down the line.-Follows a lot of the formula of the first and that helps further make things easy to guess.Some Very Disturbing/Hard Things to View
-Crosses one of my lines about animals, and even fake still hurts to watch
-The movie crosses dark corners and is going to be a bit tough to see these things come out, especially the depressing moments.-Those with a lot on their mind may be pulled down by these moments and not enjoy the ending's tie up for building to the third movie.-If you can't handle some of the more realistic battle moments, again, this movie is not the one to see.Annoying Character Gimmicks
-How many times do I have to hear, ""I'm good bro?""
-Some of the characters just scream, shrieks, and whining that don't do much
-Others are more about screaming and saying aye yi yi yi, and don't do more than that. It's cultural and tribal fitting in the world, but they don't have other things to balance out.-Other qualities that paint hardened antagonists, but then do little to deliver that punch.Action Is Different
-If you like story based action, this movie works for the emotional component.-However, the fighting flow does not work as well as the first, much more fractured and less integrative of the other contenders
-Takes more of a Rambo approach , which is cool, but again doesn't flow and sort of drags the moment on.-Some abilities are shown than cut short in favor of some drama elements that take away from the action.-A few scenes almost look like fast forward motion when things go heavy.May Have Needed More Time
-The jumps made for some faster story telling elements and we lost details on some elements I would have liked to see.-The character balance could have been solved with more time and we could have gotten a lot more of the integrative nature of the world.-Certain elements would not have felt so rushed, and maybe had more of the organic flow of the first had there again been more time.-Too much in one movie again? I think so.The VERDICT:
James Cameron's latest film is a visual masterpiece and the second bout on Pandora is just as stunning as ever. It's smart world building and storytelling, with great attention to detail on building the world further and honoring the characters that played the first world so well. Action that is placed well dances with drama, integrating many characters to the world and playing that cultural collaboration so well that it's a true science-fiction opera for many to relate to. Though the pace is welcoming to blunt the 3 hour run time, there are times where it seems things got cut, and tried to juggle too much to give the solid character development that the first one did a little better. With more questions answered and news ones arising, this middle movie mostly feels a standalone, but the focus on more movies may have been the thing to limit the movie a bit. Still, it's a film that did its job well and in my opinion worth a trip to the theater, including 3-D showings. My scores are:Action/Adventure: Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","PedroPires90","16 December 2022","Anyone who is not a fan of the first film will hardly like this one. Avatar maintains the same identity, maintains the same structure and the vast majority of its positive and negative points.This story begins in a more exciting way than the first film, with a strong first scene that forces Jake Sully and Neytiri to move from their home. They now have a family - with four children - and that's where Avatar changes the most. This is a movie very much about family. It is no longer about discovering love, but about how to protect and bring out the best in that family. This is a very interesting change and it results because all the young people have very distinct and exciting personalities, often having the most prominence in this film. Don't worry though! The other main themes are still there: colonisation, imperialism, racism, militarism, spirituality and environment.The 2nd act repeats the ""discovery of a new world"" that we saw in the first. Here it is about the aquatic world, which is fantastic, beautiful, and fascinating. However, it's too much. What should have been 20 minutes turns into more than 40 minutes of James Cameron showing off his new toys, asking us ""and this one, huh? Beautiful, right? Perfect, right?"". The plot is forgotten for several minutes and this could have completely gone awry. It doesn't happen because an epic and brutal third act is filled with high stakes, amazing action scenes and enormous tension. The ending convinces even as an open door. Several strong roots are left for the future.Although narratively the film is a little lost at times, its sound is fantastic and visually it's as fascinating as possible. As I'm not even the biggest fan of the technique, I was impressed by what Cameron did at 48fps engaging with very subtle transitions than I expected and a high level of spectacularity. Many will say that it looks like a video game, but I personally loved it. I'm a fan of aquatic films, so it was particularly exciting to see that bright and colourful world that also gives us the fantastic characters that are the tulku (a species of whales). Despite feeling simultaneously like an opening piece and a structural repetition, this is very entertaining, a good time at the cinema and I'm already looking forward to returning to Pandora in 2024.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Slarkshark","24 December 2022","Well he did it again. James Cameron creates a visual spectacle for the eyes to behold. He continues to set the standard when it comes to next generation effects.It was great to see so many of the same characters again, and just how they've grown... or uh, changed.Plot wise, it's nothing innovative. Sky people mostly want revenge, but also to take a major cog out of the Na'vi resistance by eliminating Jake Sully.The transition to water, and all that entails on Pandora made sense as Cameron's facination with the ocean is well documented. He has loads of filmmaking experience with the ocean whether from documentaries, or of course 'Titanic'.Very curious to see what part of Pandora we get to see next. I just hope it doesn't take another 13 years.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jace_the_film_guy","21 December 2022","""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must-see in theaters. Do not wait to watch it at home. This film is a masterclass in visual storytelling and world building. The first ""Avatar"" was gorgeous to watch, and it just scratched the surface of Pandora. The sequel dives deeper into the world of the Na'vi and introduces countless new layers of breathtaking visuals, especially as the characters learn ""the way of water"".If there was one weakness to the first film, it was a lack of emotional depth and character construction. James Cameron (writer/director) learned his lesson and spends a large portion of this 3-hour runtime developing new characters, especially Jake and Neytiri's kids. The theme of ""Sullys stick together"" is present throughout the film and adds a surprising layer of relatability.For a movie that is 3+ hours long, it does not feel that way for most of the runtime. However, near the 2 ½ hour mark, I was starting to feel restless and ready for the movie to wrap up. Some of the storylines had confusing finales and interestingly, it felt like there were pieces of plot left on the cutting room floor.The set up for the next two ""Avatar"" installments was evident throughout this movie. I am sure that the payoff will be worth it when ""Avatar 3"" and ""Avatar 4"" come out, but for now, these storylines just seem like loose ends. While the film does a good job of introducing new characters, such as Lo'ak, Kiri and Spider, many of the original characters are sidelined.The big question: Is ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" worth the 13-year wait? My answer: Absolutely. I believe that this film is an improvement on the first ""Avatar"" in nearly every way. It is a better story, has a stronger emotional pull and the visuals continue to improve. James Cameron is brilliant for creating this world, and I will go see this movie in theaters at least one more time, if not more, to soak in Pandora and the way of water.Best Character: Lo'ak (but really Neteyam)
Best Scene: Learning ""the way of water""
Best Quote: ""A father protects, it's what gives him meaning"" - Jake
Best Piece of Score: ""Happiness is Simple""One more note: the word ""bro"" was said probably 30 times throughout the film and got old quickly.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","foxtwc","15 June 2023","This follows the same formula as the original ... but film making was different back then. You waited too long James Cameron, people would probably have liked this movie 10 years ago but Marvel has set the bar a lot higher for action movies and this comes nowhere close to Infinity War, Guardians of the Galaxy or Dead Pool.The film was way too long for what the plot line is. Sadly they end the film as though they intend to make more. I just do not see how they can keep the audience interested with the basic plot being shoved down their eyeballs for 2+ hrs per film.I am glad I didn't get sucked into seeing it in theatres, this would not have been worth the price of tickets and treats that it costs a family these days.","

Even during action scenes, I kept thinking how much I just wanted to be there, right in the moment. And if the opportunity presented itself, wander off into safety and exploring. The world feels so real, it envelops you. Also the acting is great and believable, has you invested.One minus to the overall score is the storyline - quite often frustrating and puzzling. But the world building, acting and action scenes more than make up for it - just go and watch it on the big screen in 3d.","

After number 3 my rating may change. Now to see it in 3D. The wait between this film and the last makes the return to this world all the sweeter. There's some fascinating foreshadowing and developments in this film I hope they unravel during the later films. This film doesn't feel fully complete unlike the last film but we know there is a sequel to this one in the near future so this isn't too much of a criticism.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","nadkarnisumeet","22 December 2022","Avatar: The Way of Water review :Thirteen years after Avatar dazzled us with its technical brilliance, the second part titled The Way of Water continues as a direct sequel with twice the visual splendour and grandeur best experienced on largest 3D screen you can get!!The plot is simple- Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) raises a family with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and is living a peaceful life in Pandora forests until humans headed by old foe Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) attack the planet again for colonization. Left with no choice, Jake and his loved ones seek refuge with the Metkayina clan and learn their culture and deep bonding with the sea.James Cameron's vision of creating the Na'vi world is incredible and clap-worthy. The underwater sequences here are breathtakingly beautiful and will leave you spellbound for sure. The near hour climactic fight is another technological advancement for Hollywood and I suspect it will need another Avatar sequel to surpass it.Undoubtedly, The Way of Water is a visual soother. It will make you yearn for more even though the film's runtime exceeds three hours and the basic plot is the conventional ""good aliens vs bad humans"" type. But its ok. And its awesome. Sometimes, great things are inherently simple yet highly effective. Aren't they?!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Gleunji","20 December 2022","This is the first movie I recommend you to watch in the lower frame rate instead of the higher 48 fps. Serious lagging throughout the film which is honestly a super bad experience. And also watch it in IMAX 3D if both possible.If you have seen Black Panther, this is basically the same underwater sht and also 3 hour long. So save you the time.The cinematographer sucks this time round, lots of shaky camera, weak first person shot and pretty much a documentary base on how it was shot.Also, trying to runaway to another island so that the sky people attack other tribe instead of yours is pretty stupid of a plot.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","LansTaylor","26 December 2022","First off, shoutout to the whale subtitle.Second, the story and dialogue was so-so but the visuals and world building was amazing. I get that the children are part human but did they really have to say ""bro"" every other sentence? I personally didn't really care for Jake Sully's kids. Besides the subpar dialogue, what kept me in my seat was how photorealistic the VFX were. Every time I thought I saw a beautiful shot, the next one would blow that out of the water (pun intended).Two things James Cameron knows how to do right is pacing an action scene, like the final battle, and directing a sinking ship. I'm intrigued with the direction Cameron is going to go with the rest of the series. What's next, Avatar 3: The Drift of the Sand?!I'm excited to see the rest of the other species and races Pandora has. To offer but could we possibly keep it a bit shorter? My eyes, back, and bladder really felt the full 3 hours towards the end there and that was pushing the limit for a runtime that most people can handle without a captivating story to keep us in our seats.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","confirmeddeath","25 July 2023","This movie is good, but its not great...
It seems to me as tho the one thing, the one goal that this movie was trying very hard to achieve was to be long. It was unnecessarily long, half the movie was nonsense. Somebody was given an assignment and told ""You need to write 2 pages"" and instead of writing a meaningful 2 pages, they decided to overdo it just to kiss someones donut and they ended up with 20 pages of nonsense, pretty much like what I'm doing now in order to reach the characters required to post this piece of ...art.This movie was 50% visuals, 20% kids, 30 minutes on a whale and a brat connecting, 10% your typical villan parents and the rest is villainizing humans and how they'll destroy worlds in the future... so yeah, pretty good movie.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","MamadNobari97","28 March 2023","So I'm pretty sure thousands of reviewers here and on YT and other places have already said all these months ago, but oh well, I just watched the movie for the first time and this is my observation.You can really see these similarities if you watch them back-to-back in the span of 12 hours like I just did.The whole thing is literally the same, only the location is different. Tell me which Avatar I'm describing here, the 2009 one or the 2022:""Alien"" race goes to a distant place with indigenous people who look different and have a different shade of blue skin.The natives have a mother tree there that's basically their internet and is connected to all living things and these natives worship it.These aliens have to learn the way of these people and become one of them.Meanie baddie bad guy human is hunting these people for their resources which are extracted from their beloved sacred animals or the tree itself and this material is worth millions and is ""what's paying for all this operation"".The aliens become friends with the natives and become one of them and fight against these cruel human colonizers.The main bad guy which is Quaritch runs out of ammo and pulls out a knife and fights with Jek Soolee.The aliens who are natives now have hair sex with the mother tree and the tree calls its horde of animals to save the day.A dear person to Jek dies at the end and the body is given to the tree to absorb its energy.Sounds familiar doesn't it? And these are only the things I can remember and think of right now.Like what's next, same exact story and Quaritch back as the main baddie only we're in a fire nation or a desert island now? And the humans mine the sand or the spice in it like Dune and Jek Soolee becomes one with the desert people and they fight with the evil humans by riding giant dune worms?Anyway, this is just an observation, and anyone who remembers the first one or has watched it recently will definitely notice, I just don't understand how it took Cameron 10 years to come up with the same story and characters.But that's not to say the movie is all bad, I actually enjoyed it a lot. I still think the story worked a little better for me than the first one, even though it was like watching Force Awakens again if you know what I'm talking about. I think the characters are a lot better here and the family dynamic is interesting, even though it's cliché as hell. Like they should've just made this movie right after the first one and it would've been still cliché for the 2010s, but not as much as it is nowadays.I can totally see why many people don't like the story at all and the criticism of it is totally valid. I just personally didn't find it that much annoying or horrible, just serviceable like the first one. I didn't come here expecting some mindblowing story and plot, but then again, I didn't expect the same story either.The visuals are obviously phenomenal and after a decade of having to endure horrible CGI and visuals from high-budget movies, it's ironically a breath of fresh air to see Avatar again and how great a nearly fully green-screen movie can look with producers having patience and the creator having an actual vision instead of changing designs last minute to ruin the whole year of the visual effects team. Not to mention the crunch and underpaying them, which I hope didn't happen in this case.The underwater scenes are just fantastic and I don't think you can't find any underwater filmmaking and cinematography better than this.I also gotta say, that Spider is an absolutely horrid character that is horribly written. He's definitely the worst character in the movie. Like dude, just pick a side, wth are you doing? He literally changes teams for breakfast. I know James Cameron purposefully chose to have simple stories and plots for these movies if I recall correctly that he said so, but come on, it doesn't have to be this simple and amateurish.For a movie that's over 3 hours, it really does give some characters less time and characterization when they need them more, like Spider and Neteyam, considering that Jek Soolee is mostly a background character here and the kids are at the forefront.Neteyam more than anyone needed more screen time and characterization considering that he dies at the end and we are supposed to be sad for him, which I kinda did surprisingly which was more because of Zoe Saldaña's acting. But it would've been way better if he got half of the screen time Lo'ak got. It's mind-boggling how it's 3 hours and the oldest kid that dies and makes Neytiri go Rambo on humans doesn't have enough screen time and characterization.I saw someone say that the emotional stuff is artificial and manipulative, which I guess might be true, but it didn't really bother me and the emotional stuff actually hit.James Cameron just needs to work with a professional writer to write better plots and have better characterization when they have 3 hours to do so.The movie is a long one and it might get slow in the middle for some people, and funnily enough, it kinda felt rushed in the beginning, but the third act makes up for it and it has fantastic action and also a lot of sea action. Although I wish there were a lot more underwater scenes and more deep ocean stuff since Cameron has a fetish for the ocean floor and its unknown creatures. It's really weird that we didn't get to see more sea monsters here.Overall, I think this movie does what it aimed to; entertain us for 3 hours. Now some people might not be entertained if they are a big fan of Avatar and wanted a sequel with a better story and dare I say a different story, and some might not appreciate the longer runtime, but you can't deny that the visuals and action aren't worth it.The movie is entertaining and has fantastic visuals and action, but it is disappointing, mediocre, and repetitive in the story department and lacks a more decent characterization for some of the characters.Let's just hope he has come up with better and actually different stories for the sequels because repeating the same story twice is weird but still somewhat negligible and acceptable, but doing it a third time? That's just blasphemy! And you can't get away with doing it multiple times (MCU did it I guess). Though it would be really funny if Avatar 3, 4, and 5 came out and they all had the same story bits and plot points as the first too.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","JimmyRussell68","24 April 2023","Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and fellow hemorrhoid sufferers around the world, it's time for a review of a movie that's been in the making for over a decade and left me feeling more discomfort than a hemorrhoid flare-up that just won't quit. I'm talking about none other than Avatar 2.Now, I know that the first Avatar movie was a box office smash hit, but let me tell you, this sequel falls far short of its predecessor. The plot is lackluster, the pacing is slow, and the visuals are underwhelming compared to the groundbreaking CGI that wowed audiences back in 2009.Sure, some of the action scenes were impressive, but they felt hollow and lacked any real stakes. And the environmental message that was so prevalent in the first movie felt forced and preachy in this one.James Cameron may have spent millions of dollars and years of his life creating this movie, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it feels like a cheap knockoff of the original. The storyline is convoluted and lacks the emotional depth and impact that made the first movie so memorable.And let's not forget about the painful performances from the cast. Even the talented actors who starred in the first movie, like Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, fail to deliver the same level of engagement and excitement that made their characters so beloved in the first place.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water is a movie that falls far short of its hype and expectations. If you're looking for a sequel that will transport you to a world of wonder and awe, then this is not it. But if you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling more discomfort than a hemorrhoid flare-up, then give it a watch. Just be warned, this movie is a painful reminder of what can happen when a director gets too caught up in their own vision and loses sight of what made their original work so great.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","Timothy_Reed","8 June 2023","Watching the film it did not take long to darken my mood because of the morally completely wrong messages this film's plot is sending out into the real world of 2023, that is also threatened by global conflict and war.I can only guess why Scott decided to turn the first movie's ""Dances with wolves"" approach upside down, namely to ideologically prepare a mainly US target audience for a new global conflict with Russia or China.The movie's setting is still eye candy, of course, but what nearly made me throw up in disgust are these points:
Sully has become a patriarchal military commander who communicates with his ""family"" squad like a drill instructor promoting and demanding values of strength and honour, obedience and use of force, expecting to be addressed with a ""Yes, sir!"" by his Na'vi kidsthe tribal life of the peaceful Na'vi has been militarised, no scene without human gear of war or a display of military power or technology, admittingly they had weapons before, but only for hunting purposes; maybe Sully expected the humans to return and he wanted his tribe to be prepared but that fails and he chooses exileNeytiri has been subdued to an obedient wife and agrees to leave her beloved ancient forest home despite the fact that the human invaders would most probably destroy their base regardless Sully's and his insurgent family's presence, by doing so completely ignoring her motivation in part 1 (protecting the world tree) and just obeying her husband's order to retreat into exile...I admit I still have 90 minutes to watch but I so not see any chance for a turnaround.Maybe my attitude is not shared by everyone but what can be wrong to promote values like living in harmony and nature, equality and tolerance, peace and prosperity? Matrix 4 does it and that is maybe the reason why it failed at the box office and was disliked by those who blindly follow the war propaganda.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","capricaone","17 December 2022","At the very best I would rate this 5, just for the visuals, and even that includes some bad CGI on a couple of occasions which I thought was really bad coming from James Cameron. The boat crashing scene just looks like something from a 90s computer game.Avatar 2 is so inferior to Avatar 1, I could not stress that enough. It is missing so many elements that made the first movie, with an absolutely empty pointless story that seems to be mish-mashed into the visuals. Avatar 2 has none of the mystic feeling energy that the first one had. And after a 13 year wait, I just felt so disappointed with the movie, not reaching any expectations whatsoever.There are reviews listed here, mentioning 'best film ever', 'best ever CGI', 'Oscar material' etc etc... either it's their first trip to the cinema or they have never seen a good film to compare it to.Overall it's just one big empty snoozefest with visuals.","

Seeing the ""humans"" be a$$hats and kill indiscriminately is not my idea of a fun time. This movie got depressing within five minutes and just continued to disappoint as time went on. Geez, it was so sad in places.Also, they stole a plotline from Jupiter Ascending - now that was a great movie - and made it even worse.I'm not sure why Cameron made this... oh, wait... BIG BUCKS.So, this was the third disappointing movie we saw from the Oscar season - Everything, Everywhere was too bizarre to finish watching - yes, it was boring, too.Then we watched that Banshees of Inersherin movie. What a sad, sorry excuse for a film that was. Geez.No one even mentioned the fabulous 5000 Years of Longing movie. Now, that was an awesome film!So, I've listed four films in this, simply to explain what's crap and what's not.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","maue-19674","23 December 2022","How to describe 'Avatar Way of Water'? It isn't easy because there is nothing else like this series. It has taken over a dozen years to bring the second instalment of the Avatar story to our screens and, in doing so, it has created the usual dichotomy of Avatar 'fans' and Cameron 'haters'. So, what was MY take on this Sequel? Well, firstly I watched this in IMAX 3D, which is the top of the range experience. I would certainly NOT bother with this format for 95% of the other Films out there, however, this is a Cameron production and he does nothing by halves. Having seen the recent 'Avatar' re-release, I anticipated that this would look visually incredible - and it DOES. The VFX are SO far ahead of anything I have seen (it 'trashes' recent MCU efforts like the risible 'Thor: Love & Thunder'). So the VFX and indeed, the fabulous cinematography, are astounding, with the underwater sequences in 3D being particularly stunning and effective.The story has been criticised by many people, probably because it is the ONLY element left TO have a go at, but again, the story is a continuation of the relationship between Jake and Neytiri, only decades after the events in the first Avatar. Briefly, the 'Sky People' are back - yes, those Humans are a real pain - but this time they bring a whole new motive for landing on Pandora AND they bring a 'Quaritch avatar' with them, no doubt because he has the proper motivation to hunt down Jake. Problem is, Jake now has a Family and pretty soon he decides to move from the Forests out beyond the seas to live with the ocean 'na'vi'. Needless to say, it isn't long before the 'Sky People' in the shape of Quaritch, start closing the net...
Yes, a straightforward storyline - as if most Hollywood blockbusters have anything else! - but it is HOW it is executed that counts. All of the characters, from the members of the Sully Family to the 'new' Quaritch are given screen time to develop, extremely unusual in Films this large. The most fascinating is Sigourney Weaver's 'Kiri', who appears to be more than just an 'old soul' in a teenage body.The middle section of the film looks like a nature documentary on 'Pandorian ocean life' and the relationship between the wildlife and the sea Na'vi 'Metkayina' is especially focussed. All this gives way to the third act, a typical Cameron 'tour de force', of a battle between the 'mechanised humans' and the more primitively armed 'Na'vi'.Overall, this is a Film I actually want to go and see AGAIN. It was packed full of detail, much of which viewers would struggle to take in on the first viewing.THIS is exactly why I ignore the 'haters' and also the rather childish reviews of some 'so-called' serious Film Critics, who for some reason write trite reviews that show no objectivity at all.Cameron's greatest skill is to give us something that is entertaining, spectacular AND with a serious underlying message. Unfortunately, there are still cinema-goers who just want to watch movies with NO message at all.Avatar Way of Water wears it's creator's heart on it's sleeve - Cameron does care about the natural world and what we are doing to it. It comes through in every frame of this 3 hour magnum opus.The 'world Building' for just these two Films leaves everything else in the shade and I for one will wait with eagerness for the next Chapter in this saga.Keep going Jim Cameron, I want to see more!","

If you have a cinema near you showing this in 3D it is an amazing experience and to truly feel the effort and time that went into this sequel you really should watch it in 3D for the optimal experience, I can't wait to see what happens next and I hope it succeeds in the box office.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","parksiet","18 December 2022","Let's get one very obvious thing straight right off the bat: the visuals in this movie are unlike anything you have ever seen! Watching this film is like looking into a dream, the boundary-pushing VFX work Weta digital has done here is leagues above any CGI I have ever seen. The sheer detail in every frame is impeccable, heck, when you can see the detailed pigmentation on a CGI character's skin, you know you're looking at something impressive! Even the water is so beautifully realized, it genuinely feels like you're looking at something very realistic! It is very clear Cameron doesn't accept something unless it looks as real as it possibly can! It's very easy to forget that it's all CGI! I would look at the characters and see them as real beings, completely forgetting they are motion capture characters. That's one of my favourite parts of these films; it really is like James Cameron is taking you along for the ride to experience Pandora- you aren't watching a movie... you are there, and I'm not going to lie, there were times where I even forgot I was in a movie theatre! As far as I was concerned, I was on Pandora!Seeing it in IMAX 3D (and really you haven't seen this movie if you didn't see it in 3D), it feels like you're on the ride at Disney, like you are a part of that world! This has to be among the most visually stunning theatrical experiences I've ever had, right up there with seeing the original ""Avatar"" for the first time in IMAX 3D a few months ago (unfortunately I was too young when it was initially released 13 years ago)! James Cameron has revolutionized VFX again, one upping only himself! The 3D is incredible, the motion capture is next level, you can see so much detail in the emotions, and the overall look and feel of the world (especially the underwater effects) are just remarkable. Even the lighting was spectacular. It's an absolute spectacle and filmmaking achievement. On a technical level, this film is mind blowing; it's absolutely staggering. The amount of visual ingenuity that is constantly on display - it's insane. I genuinely have no clue how they pulled it all off... it's just the magic of cinema. The film provides an immersive experience to be found nowhere else, and truly instills a sense of awe and wonder from beginning to end!Now, if I am being honest, when I first came out of the movie, I only liked, but didn't love it. I was almost caught off guard by the sheer amount of story and spectacle I had just witnessed, I was surprised with how different the movie was from what I expected. But over the past few days, I have found myself unable to stop thinking about it. I want to go back to Pandora; I want to experience this movie again! Much like the first film, this one has captured my imagination, it only took a few days to really sink in and hit me! At this point, James Cameron feels closer to a miracle worker than a moviemaker, and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is yet another wonder that must be seen to be believed. A holy text, an artistic thesis and an environmental plea wrapped in $300M of supreme cinematic spectacle. Nobody is operating on the level of Cameron! The film is a jaw-dropping, astonishing experience that manages to surpass the original in many ways, not just with the technology and visuals, but also in terms of character, themes, and dramatic weight. Personally, I still enjoyed the first one more, but there is no doubt that this long-awaited sequel has one-upped its predecessor in many ways. The main thing that keeps the first one higher in my books is that it tells a complete one off story. In this case, Cameron still tells a complete story, but it also serves as a bit of a reset to tell a larger story across his four film arc. This is like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the ""Avatar"" franchise, and I'm sure this film will only get even better with time as the story further progresses. One of the best things about this movie is that it feels like Cameron is just warming up. He will most likely top this, and that is an extremely exciting idea to think about when considering how good this is!Much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this sequel is more of an intimate, emotionally-charged epic. Cameron pivots from end-of-world stakes to drama rooted in character and theme, interrogating the fraught bonds between parents and children, or the limits of protecting family or tribe, while also weaving in a strong environmentalism message. It is one of the most universal and compassionate blockbusters of our time. Cameron's entire heart and soul is all over this thing; his love of the ocean, his experiences as a father and son, his continued plea for universality. ""The Way of Water"" is simply an excellent sequel that while an astonishing achievement visually, dives deeper than bigger. Just like the first one, the story is very simple and we've seen stories like it before. But that seems to be the trick of the ""Avatar"" franchise thus far; you tell a very simple story that is appealing to anyone and everyone, something like, in this movie's case, ""protect those you love"", and then you paint that story on a massive canvas of otherworldly places, creatures, and technology that you have never seen before. But the true trick with both films is that Cameron conveys a valuable message about environmentalism within the films, the first being about protecting our forests, and this one being about protecting our oceans. If any young kids can go experience this movie and experience that message and see why it's important while also being entertained then that's a win for the movie! It's what James Cameron is trying to do; make us fall in love with the natural beauty of Pandora, root for the characters to protect it, and then come out of the movie thinking about how we can protect our own planet. I found the film even plays like a nature documentary at times; albeit with CGI alien creatures. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an awe-inspiring blend between a nature documentary and a blockbuster - a thrilling three-hour-long travelogue through the oceans of Pandora with deep feeling in its foundation and an unspeakably epic third act that will leave you breathless and in tears. It's just so rare to watch a blockbuster that's both formally ambitious and full of authentic emotion.The movie is undeniably beautiful and wondrous, I think I have made that clear. But is it perfect? Frankly, no. I didn't see the ""masterpiece"" that many seem to have seen - to me it was very close (and still excellent), but does have its flaws, primarily with the script. You can't fault this movie on a technological level, from that regard it is perfection, but I did think the script needed some work. I have to also clarify that while it is not the best script ever written, it feels like the type of blockbuster script we would've seen in the 80s and 90s - meaning it is easily better than most written today! First off, as many have always said, Cameron's dialogue is not the greatest. It's better than George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" dialogue, but does still have a bit of awkwardness to it. However that didn't take me out of it too much, I honestly didn't notice it until thinking about it after. But really, my main problem with the film is that I didn't think the 3 hours runtime was justified and I felt the length in some places. This is partially due to both the edit and the script, however I feel like the editing was much more polished overall. The editing here blew me away. Yes, the pacing is flawed but overall pretty good, but I also feel that each shot specifically really gets the chance to breathe, letting you really appreciate the spectacle of it all. It's not pretentious as no shot goes on for too long. It isn't snappy or overly-done, just so miraculous and smooth. So to keep the runtime, I would have stretched out the first act and condensed the 2nd, as it felt like at the beginning we were rushed through tons of very important world-building and exposition, skimming through story I would have liked to see in more detail, only to arrive at the 2nd act and take a bit of a pause to the pace of the film. However, I thought the pacing did work really well for one element; the emotion of the film.This film has much bolder emotional swings than the first did, and I love that it really takes the time to explore the characters and relationships on a deeper level. The first was cool and definitely had emotional weight, but I truly felt a much wider range of emotions while watching this one. But, back to the pacing, I did not feel as emotionally engaged in the first half as I did in the second. There was a lot of bold new story and characters introduced by Cameron early on, so it took awhile to feel out the characters and places, as well as the story as a whole. Not to mention the first act presents a lot of information really fast, it felt like a lot to take in and I wish we could've spent more time in that part of the story instead of using montages to summarize our way through it. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like we were bombarded with a lot of new and insane world building information with only a single line of dialogue or one shot devoted to each item, it almost gave me whiplash with how fast it was going. However, once we got to the midpoint of the film I was in. It worked a lot better as well as hit a lot more emotional beats, as well as featuring phenomenal, giant action in the 3rd act! The movie overall is light on action, but once you get to the 3rd act Cameron reminds us how incompetent 95 percent of the large-scale action we get in theatres is these days... because the action here is absolutely thrilling! It even had some ""Titanic"" elements to the finale... James Cameron seems to love flooding ships and watching characters escape! The film as whole is lighter on action than the first, and when we get it the stakes are not as high as in the first movie, but regardless, when we get the action, it hits hard!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","TheLastDon81","18 December 2022","Ok I'll state the obvious first, this is the greatest visual experience I've ever had in a theatre. The special effects are next level and the 3D is outstanding.Ok now onto the story. Avatar for some reason has gotten a bit of a bad rap during the last 10+ years since it's release. I get that the story itself wasn't the most original. Well I think this makes up for it. The story, while not being citizen Kane, is pretty good. It's interesting and keeps you engaged until the end. Finally the ending sets up part 3 very well.Make sure you watch it in 3D, You won't be disappointed. Its fantastic.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","marcovinicio-74921","8 January 2023","There are mane positives with this movie, the visual effects and the design, that is undeniable, but when you think deeper then there are many questions that really disturb me.The first movie was all about saving the environment and how the blue people were defending their world and how they live and respect it. This movie is all about the revenge of one of the marines against the protagonist, nobody cared about the world or the natural resources exploitation, it was like terminator, a bad guy chasing another one destroying everything on its way.The other thing is this fascination that Hollywood has with machine guns and bullets, this is the future right? So why on earth are the humans still using guns? Also, it is 2023 now, many countries are moving towards electric cars, but in this future the space ships are still exploding because they are full of gasoline? Wouldn't humanity found an alternative energy source by then?Finally, it looks like their focus was to create the products for the franchise, now is all underwater, so new toys can be released, what is next? The snow? I know they are planning 5 more movies, but I barely tolerated this one, 3 hours and half of the movie was about the kids learning to dive under water and live the recurrent American team of the bullying, don't they understand that the rest of the world do not bully and probably other planets neither? The other half was shootings and explosions. At the end nobody learnt anything and the society in there remained intact, while the USA government I guess on representation of earth, just spent billions of dollars trying to kill an exmarine ?The whole premise was just ridicule. And sorry but I won't get back these three hours of my life ...","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","bjutton-491-355388","16 December 2022","James Cameron's over a decade long wait, The Way of Water, shows us time and again how he is able to create a marvel of cinematics. The sequel to the 2009 hit still glimmers with soul and shows a keen understanding of the craft it takes to create a motion picture. The CGI and effects are sublime, a beauty to behold. The musical scores, as well as Zoe Saldaña captivating vocals on a certain track are also truly heartfelt and help add to the magic and ambience that is Pandora.Unfortunately, while this picture has a lot to boast about visually, I found the story to be safe, unoriginal, and lacking. It's a shame, as once you get to the meat of what is happening which is explained early on, you expect there to be more to it as time goes by. But what you see on the surface is what you get. This doesn't mesh well with the one dimensionality of characters, new and old who are brought into the Avatar universe, quickly to be forgotten. Bad guys who are one note, with simplistic motives, with no sense of curiosity or reaction to the world or the events around them. Even if the film is going for sending a message like it's predecessor, I think the characters require more deft handling to really bring them to life and show a bit of confliction when dealing with their inner demons. The black and white storytelling creates an easy plot devise to rally around the bad guys defeat, while unapologetically sympathising with the good guys. It's a laziness that shouldn't be present in a film of Cameron's caliber.In relation to the characters mentioned earlier, I also couldn't say I found there to be any stand out performances from the cast in this movie. While I didn't find anyone's performance lacking, I also wasn't blown away like I had been with the first. Neytiri, played by the masterful Zoe Saldaña showcased a plethora of emotion in the first movie that still resonates to this day. But in The Way of Water, despite her character being given things to work with, and still personally being the strongest in the cast, I was still left wanting more. So you can imagine how I feel about the rest of the cast. But that is no way saying that the acting was subpar, but rather again that the direction and writing didn't give them too much to work with. Despite having a running time of over 3 hours, this film still felt somehow rushed in that I wasn't able to connect with the characters in the same way that I did the first. And this feeling, or lack thereof, comes back to bite in the final act of the film, which left things feeling very anti-climactic and unfinished by the end. At least for me.Overall, this film is a stunning spectacle that I would recommend fans of the first to see. And while I am overall disappointed in the direction this film took as a whole, I am still optimistic about the franchise and what sequels will have to offer in the future.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","jonassladen","25 June 2023","Everyone has already commented on the film's depiction of man's cruelty, its repetition, its length, and the way it incredulously drifted from important points.I'll mention that even though the Reef Navi had taught themselves extended breathing techniques (although non-Reef Jake only some training while Quaritch, little to none), they can't stay underwater for tens of minutes, pass out, and not take water into their lungs. Add to this that Jake was not born a Navi and Quaritch has been converted to one for only a very short time. (On a side note we wonder if Quaritch, who despises Navis, wouldn't still come to appreciate the power and majesty of being one and secondly, how easily could he actually change back to his human form afterwards?).Yet, both Jake and Quaritch were underwater for extreme lengths of time. In both cases they were retrieved and survived without any long-term health issues or brain dysfunction. It is a fantasy - but it stretches unreal limits of imagination.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","thesar-2","18 December 2022","And speaking of water, don't drink any for 6 hours prior. This part 2 of 5 is OVER THREE HOURS LONG. The line for the bathroom following is gonna be long.Just kidding. Unbelievably, I am recommending this movie. And frankly, I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. I only went as a favor to a friend. And there are TERRIBLE things about this, but the good outweighed the bad.(I don't wish to rehash the original, but if you need a recap, seek out that page.) About the same time since the 2009 blockbuster, or 13-years later, Hero-Jake has a family on Planet Pandora. Despite him originating as a villain, he became the Alien Planet Tribal/Warrior leader. Unfortunately, the Sky-People (i.e., Hysterically ""evil"" Earthlings) are back to seek revenge for their defeat in the original movie. Good luck to wherever Jake takes his family for safety.I had a feeling this would be better than the original, but not by much. I hated the original's regurgitated plot and as great as the graphics were, I truly felt the ""Tall Smurfs"" (that I referred to them as) were fake AF. In fact, when I saw the countless trailers for Avatar 2, I thought the Tall Smurfs STILL looked bad. (Same thing happened with 2002's Spider-Man. I saw the trailer for that and the FX looked hilariously bad. When the movie came out, it looked perfect.) Luckily, they DID look better in the finished product, but still cartoonish.I will get the negatives out of the way. The story was meh, but serviceable. The dialogue was some of the WORST I've heard in decades. Like painfully terrible. Think Phantom Menace bad. The Tall-Smurfs still looked fake, but not AS fake in 2009. And I think worst of all: BAD Editing. Scenes just abruptly ended and started mid-action with the next set of characters. It was really jarring.The remaining graphics and attention to detail: SPOT ON. Like magnificent. I saw it in 3D, but on a regular screen. Unfortunately, the entire screen was not used, leaving large vertical black boxes on the left/right of the screen. So that WAS distracting. The 3D still looked good. GREAT? Nope. Plus, there were so many 3D-tropes used. While I expect that from Friday the 13th Part III or Jaws 3D, I don't from James Cameron. But I will say, any scenes at water level: spectacular. Like breathtaking.Another positive: despite its 3+ hour runtime, the time FLEW BY. Only ONE TIME in the entire movie did I feel it drag. I could forgive that for any movie. There was enough action, dialogue and plot devices to make us NEVER feel the 3-hour timeframe. Also, I did like how they explained back many of the original cast, even when they had previously died. And finally, I will give MAJOR kudos to a tremendous, albeit inevitable, climatic final battle. That last third made up for ANY shortcoming this film had. I had so much fun in that final act and it was everything I personally wanted it to be.The movie did feel like maybe 6-8 TV episodes I just binge-watched. I would not have been opposed to a new series or miniseries taking place post 2009's Avatar. If you view it that way, the 3-hour runtime will also flyby.I only saw the original Avatar once and in theatres roughly 2 months after it premiered. I actually didn't want to see that, either. My friend dragged me one week after he had already seen it 2x without me. Unintentionally, I made us late that weekend and the movie was sold out (as it had been for weeks.) So, we tried again the following weekend (of which I still didn't really want to see it) and was successful. I thought it was OKAY at best. I gave it 4/10 stars and honestly felt I was being generous to my friend who really loved this movie. I mostly hated how fake and dumb the Tall Smurfs acted and looked. Plus, the story, stolen from Fern Gully, Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves, was atrocious.No matter. While I'll probably never watch Avatar: The Way of Water again, I do recommend it and not upset I saw it. I HAD vowed off the sequel(s) due to my distain of part 1. Because of part 2's enormous upgrade in quality, I WILL see the remaining movies. You can tell in this one where the franchise is headed (these movies are WILDLY predictable) and I am curious to see it all unfold. Just in case I'm wrong.Really doubt that, though.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","AJ9441","5 January 2023","This movie was so silly and boring at multiple times I wanted to leave the cinema.Story:
The story is completely ridiculous and is Pocahontas meets free Willy meets jungle book. It's slow and draggy in typical Cameron fashion. We get a full 30 mins of the son befriending a whale (I took this opportunity to visit the concession stand and didn't miss anything). Many in the cinema also laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of the whales talking to the main characters.For some reason there is a character which I guess is Tarzan inspired? Anyway the main characters are so dull that towards the end you actually end up rooting for the villains just to prevent another sequel.The main friction point also makes no sense, these whalers spend billions in tech to get a vial of whale juice worth $80m?Acting:
Nothing much do discuss here, not great but not bad.Graphics:
Here is where the film shines, but are they that much better than avengers or Star Wars? I would argue not, especially not for 3 hours of your time.Verdict:
It's not the worst movie ever, but it's bad. In hindsight I would not have watched it. They teased a sequel which I have no intention of seeing.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","samadabbasi","18 December 2022","Just saw it at Science Museum IMAX in London and immediately fell in love with the movie. This is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my life. James Cameroon is a cinematic genius. Worth the 13 years wait. Astonishingly beautiful.From start to finish the movie keeps you engaging, making you more and more indulged in Pandora's world. And this time the Pandora's world is even more beautiful underwater.I know there are some talks of story being weak and unliked by critics, I would just say that go and see for yourself, you'll not be bored even for a second. It is awe inspiring and wonderfully made. What else people want?Go see it in IMAX and enjoy!","

The Amrit was not /cannot be derived out of a whale like sea Mammal .... Straight up distortion of Hindu mythology ...little or no research done in that ... The movie is all special effects with a 90s Hindi movie like very very predictable story ...it is only working because the release was delayed by a decade ....too many special effects extremely weak storyline ... Bogus movie ... Shall pass Avatar 3. Come up with something new ... There was nothing new in this movie ....","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","eugen-petersen-811-310773","27 December 2022","This is to save people like me 3+ hours of their lives. If this writing and acting did not take place in the beautiful Avatar world I would give it 2.5 stars.If you wanted the sequel to build on the story of the first part instead of repeat it with a new coat of paint, you will feel (like me) severely disappointed.It was like they spent everything on special effects and then bought the story on Fiverr. I sat there in disbelief waiting for the time to pass.There is close to no character development, the dialogues are short and uninspired, the values transmitted are surprisingly outdated e.g. What is the role of a father.I really wanted to like it, but cannot recommend seeing it to anyone who needs a decent plot to like a movie.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","denise-larsson-usa","9 April 2023","Visually it's a 10/10Story wise its almost the same as the first movie.In the first move we are stunned by the beautiful world and forrest they live in. In this movie they move and we are once again stunned by the beautiful water world they move to.Just like in the first movie he (and his family this time) has to learn how to navigate this ""new"" world.In the first movie we have one main bad guy who dies, and in this one we have... the same guy? The first guy downloaded his memories onto a ""hard drive"" that is put in to a new avatar (don't ask me how this works because idk). So basically its the same guy but...not.Just like the first movie this one ends with a big war.Some random things that bothered me in this movie:The baby in the beginning of the movie. Why did it basically look like a human baby painted blue? It was really chubby and human proportioned and I would have expected longer arms, legs, and torso like all the avatars have. It threw me off.The kids accents?? Seriously, they all sound different. They don't sound like their mom or their dad, or even each other. And continuity of accents was all over the place (with the kids). Sometimes they sounded like they had an accent and some times they sounded American. The most prominent scene you can tell that the accents are off is at the end of the movie when the dad ""visits"" his oldest son at the river. First you hear him talk as a child -with a clear American accent. And then when he's older he speaks again -with what I can only describe as a butchered Nigerian accent? (I'm sorry if Nigerian is incorrect, thats just what I think it sounded like. I don't mean to be rude in any way if anyone takes offence).All in all I think the movie (plot) was at best a 6/10 but I give it 1 star for how visually stunning it was, so a 7/10.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","DantiMovies","24 December 2022","If you're reading the reviews that the story isn't as strong as other movies, they're just being snobs and probably didn't get enough love from their parents.James Cameron's focus on this movie is to create an immersive experience into Pandora and he did it majestically.I took my entire family to see and everyone was mindblown at the landscapes, fauna, and flora.This movie makes me want to see so many more Avatar movies, nobody wanted the movie to end because we felt like we were part of the world at least for a tiny second.EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED watch on IMAX 3D. It will change your opinion of 3D movies.I want more!","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","martinjwolfenden","15 December 2022","No plot, no real story and dialogue written by a three year old in crayon on a bus window. In fact it felt like Tron, if instead of being sucked off into an 80s game cabinet, Jeff Bridges had ended up in an colourful children's game that teaches them to count and recognise letters. No zooming around on light bikes but plenty of Herby the Rainbow Unicorn showing you how to spell S***t.I'm not sure what has happened to poor James Cameron. I mean he's always been an average director whose ego often outstrips his talent but this has to be a career low. Which is saying something, as this is the man who made the first Avatar. Which was basically the 'great white saviour' trope applied to Smurfs. Stay at home for this one.","

"Avatar: The Way of Water","cardsrock","31 December 2022","I went into this not really looking forward to the exceedingly long runtime and liking, but not loving, the original Avatar. Big Jim has yet again managed to defy the haters and critics by constructing a visual masterpiece unlike much anything ever put to screen. The story is definitely not masterpiece material, but it's solid enough to make this a very worthwhile venture back into the world of Pandora.The underwater scenes in particular are a sight to behold and you really can feel the movie magic that Cameron tries to conjure up. He definitely takes a leisurely stroll through the middle third of this film, but it picks up dramatically in the final act. Cameron crafts some of the most visceral and kinetic action scenes that I've ever seen. Yes, the story is a bit hokey, but you know what, it's pretty earnest and works for the most part. My one big issue would be that it's never really explained why the Marines are so hellbent on devoting all this time and money in getting Jake Sully, other than just blanket revenge.The Way of Water is the success that Cameron and the movie industry needed it to be and I for one will happily jump on the next ship heading out to Pandora.","
