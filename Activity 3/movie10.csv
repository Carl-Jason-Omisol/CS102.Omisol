"kosmasp","23 November 2020","I'm not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can't see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song ""This is me"" is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.Every song has its purpose (still of course you can question the why people would start just sing and dance as if they had choreographed it in advance - well they have, but you know what I mean) and it works. Be it the comedy numbers (Hugh and Zac in one instance in a bar just to name one example) or as dramatic pieces. Hugh has so much fun it transcends the screen ... if you are way worse with Musicals than me, maybe don't watch it .. otherwise give it a shot! But most definitely do listen to the song ""This is me"" ... phenomenal!","

"Brandon-Donlon","25 February 2019","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.","

"Her-Excellency","7 April 2018","I have watched this film approximately twenty or more times. That is in no way an exaggeration and I may be low-calling it. Sometimes, I just have it on in the background while I work out or in the morning or while getting ready for work or I play it while cooking in the evening. On a couple of occasions, I've even caught my boyfriend humming the tunes. To say the songs stick with you, is an understatement. In fact, we've listened and watched it so much, that on every 20th Century Fox Movie ""opening"" sequence on any and all other subsequent 20th Century Fox movies we've watched, I automatically think of this one, and I am half expecting to see and hear the ""Ah, ah, ahhh, ahh ..."" and Hugh Jackman with his low ""Ladies and Gents . . . "". 
 
Besides having a catchy and moving soundtrack, the film itself is a wonder to look at. The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are well-done, and again, come on: HUGH JACKMAN singing and dancing. What could be better? Well, for one, not better, but almost as great, is Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind. The lady is gorgeous, and while she actually doesn't sing her rendition of ""Never Enough"" (Loren Allred does), the passion and zeal she brings to her onstage performance, is one for the books. I could literally (and have) replay that one scene over and over. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman also have a duet which is fun and witty and very creatively done. The only reason I did not give it a ""10"", is probably an unpopular view, and I know I will amass a hugh (not a typo :)) number of thumbs down, but oh well: I did not care for Zendaya AT ALL. I think she was so very miscast. I do not think she looked pretty in the film (although after filming, I saw her giving a couple of interviews and she looked beautiful); I thought she had absolutely zero chemistry with Zac Efron; and lastly, both her acting and her voice are like chalk grating on a blackboard to me. I think Logan Browning would have been cuter in the role. That's just me though, although it did affect my thoughts on the film and my score.All in all, WATCH IT if you have not yet done so. It is beautiful to look at and a (modern) masterpiece to the ears.","

"jecal","27 December 2017","This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.","

"BlueIrisDaisy","3 January 2019","Absolutely beautiful movie. Visually stunning, fantastic acting, songs you'll keep singing for months after. And the songs are catchy without being cheesy. Love the choreography as well. You can't sit still while watching this movie!
The story is very interesting and moving, and the issues they face are still relevant today which makes it very relatable. I've watched it three times and it makes me well up every time, my husband as well.
If you haven't seen it yet, go see it! Even if you're not normally into musicals, I'd still give it a chance :)","

"xjumper65","18 December 2020","It's hard to come up with something that hasn't already been said. Are critics are wrong? Yes. Does it have great music? Absolutely. Will you want to watch it again and again? Almost certainly. The entire cast does phenomenally well singing and dancing and for many, this achievement will be the first line in their biographies. It's a musical that is generally inspiring and evokes good feelings, but still takes you on an emotional journey. It's far from a documentary on P.T. Barnum, but that's not it's purpose. As someone obsessed with Hamilton to the point where I listened to the soundtrack everyday for 2 years before seeing it live on Broadway, I avoided watching this one because I just assumed it couldn't even come close. I was wrong. I'm not saying it's better than Hamilton or even as good because I don't think anything will ever be, but The Greatest Showman is definitely a modern classic that earns a place on the list of must-see musicals. Despite its 19th century setting, the songs are fresh, modern, up-beat numbers that can only be described as instant classics. Just try NOT singing along, I dare you. This is not an old school musical like West Side Story or The Sound of Music; it's very modern in the best sense of the word. The choreography and dancing are also first rate and the movie engages you and sweeps you along so well that by the end, you won't even believe it's been an hour and forty-five minutes. I could watch this weekly and never tire of it. Rather than the critics, trust the viewer reviews, the box office numbers, and the fact that it stayed popular in theaters for so long, they had to forcibly pull it before it's popularity waned because the DVD was about to drop and the streaming deals were about to kick in. If you've ever seen a single musical you liked, you're sure to love this one. If you've never enjoyed a musical before, the. this may be the one to bring you into the fold.","

"sunchick116-872-583383","27 December 2017","Now THIS is how you do a film! What an epic masterpiece! I don't understand the critics criticism of the lack of a story. There was A very clear cut journey of barnum's desire to be accepted and then learning what is really important in life. All the songs were so catchy, and more our importantly, inspirational. They had something to say. Makes me sad to see so many missed the message of this very important movie, just because it was wrapped up in a fun experience. Can't say enough good things about this film. It's just fantastic. Our audience clapped at the end.","

"TheLittleSongbird","4 January 2018","Love musicals, always have from a very young age seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music', 'Calamity Jane', 'Singin in the Rain' and Disney musicals. So there is absolutely no bias against musicals, though there are bad ones out there and ones that are still enjoyable or mixed where stories, scripts or both are not strong suits. Went to see 'The Greatest Showman' yesterday with my sister, having been blown away by the trailer (one of the best of the year to me). Both of us found ourselves loving it, it actually is one of my favourites of the year and loved it just as much as 'La La Land'. Like was said with another 2017 favourite 'Paddington 2' it was a breath of fresh air after a variable year seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart as well of course some gems. Am not sure where the critic bashing (which has been blown out of proportion for some time now for a lot of films, acclaimed and panned, and is getting incredibly annoying and abused) is coming from. Despite the low Metacritic score and the average one for Rotten Tomatoes, actually personally have seen a lot of positive reviews and word of mouth even from people hard to please.Is 'The Greatest Showman' perfect? Not quite. Some secondary roles are sketchy at best and only serve as ones getting in the way of the troupe overcoming obstacles and adversity and providing conflict. A few of the dramatic parts, like the fire, veer on the slightly melodramatic. Those are my only real complaints.Anybody who has heard of Jenny Lind will need to suspend disbelief at how she would never have sung like she does here. No record survives of her singing (apart from a rumoured cylinder recording, recordings that often didn't do justice to singing voices, particularly in later life and when they were past prime, and nothing like how they are documented as), but from what has been read about her personally her vocal production and technique is too perfect for a voice that has been described as an acquired taste voice despite immense popularity and admiration. Can overlook that, because ""Never Enough"" was so brilliantly performed and it is hard to match what Jenny Lind sounded like when you don't have the audible evidence and only have documentation on critical reception to go by. 'The Greatest Showman' is also not that sort of film to do that.Honestly feel however that the historical inaccuracy, as a biographical drama 'The Greatest Showman' is heavily fictionalised, can, and should be, easily ignored. It is so easy to be captivated by the incredible dazzle and delights of the spectacle, and not many 2017 films left me feeling charmed, with my heart fully warmed, fully entertained, uplifted and with tears welling up in my eyes. 'The Greatest Showman' did all those things, from as early as ""A Million Dreams"" and never let go.'The Greatest Showman' looks amazing, one of the best-looking films of the year. It is one vibrant and classy shot and frame after another, the colours are eye-popping without ever being garish or exhausting and the period detail is as sumptuous as they come. The editing is dazzling and if this is a directorial feature film debut honestly can't wait to see where 'Michael Gracey's directing career takes him.Was wholly captivated by the song and dance numbers. To me the songs were truly infectious and catchy. ""A Million Dreams"", ""Never Enough"" and ""This is Me"" are the particularly memorable standouts. The choreography is a sheer delight in its energy, class and verve, ""This Is Me"", ""From Now On"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" are just jaw-dropping. The cast do them justice. Vocally, Loren Alfred in ""Never Enough"" and Keala Settle in ""This Is Me"" are brilliant and the aforementioned songs for the choreography are especially well danced.Personally don't agree that 'The Greatest Showman' lacks substance or that the dramatic parts are empty. Sure the more dramatic sections are not as memorable, as well done or as entertaining as the song and dance numbers. Some of it is melodramatic. However the family scenes do have a lot of heart and charm, are sympathetically and touchingly played and the girls are adorable. The themes and values are not hammered home too much and are relevant and as relatable today as they were then. Couldn't have asked for better performances, especially the pitch-perfect one of Hugh Jackman, showing that he is fully at ease in musicals as he is as Wolverine. Despite loving him as Valjean in 'Les Miserables', the role of P. T. Barnum suits him much better particularly in the singing, he sounds incredible with a more even and attractive tone. He is as light-on-his-feet as the great dancers of the Golden Age classic musicals were (capturing the spirit of this era was another thing 'The Greatest Showman' excelled at) and he handles the dramatic/family moments with nuance. Zac Efron not only sounds wonderful and dances a dream (especially in ""Rewrite the Stars"") but shows that he can act, he has come on such a long way and this is the direction he should be taking. Michelle Williams is sympathetic and touching and Rebecca Ferguson is every inch the operatic diva. Keala Settle and Zendaya are especially good of the troupe and the singing voice of young Barnum is beautiful. Overall, really is a great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"wise-40311","5 January 2018","I'm sorry folks but the critics are brain dead, The system is rigged by movie studios paying off these worthless critics to only favor certain movies, they should be ashamed of themselves, hope you can sleep at nights knowing users outnumber your worthless rigged pay off reviews. I'm not a musical type person at all but this movie touched me in every aspect of the movie, I had tingles running down my body and couldn't hold back my tears. If this movie doesn't touch you, then you don't have a heart, period and that's coming from a right wing conservative.This is by far the Greatest movie of 2017....plan on going to see it again. Also, bought the Soundtrack too. Two Thumbs Up.","

"zkonedog","21 September 2018","The success of ""La La Land"" opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and ""The Greatest Showman"" is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.For a basic plot summary, ""Greatest Showman"" tells the story of how P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) built his circus empire. This was largely accomplished by using ""freaks"" (bearded lady, dog-faced boy, etc.) to draw curiosity to his museum and later shows. Though initially deemed as catering to the ""lowest common denominator"", Barnum's shows eventually won over the hearts of people (especially children) around the world. Also focused on in this flick is Barnum's marriage to Charity (Michelle Williams) and partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron).By positioning itself in the way that it does, ""Greatest Showman"" only deflects any criticism that can be thrown at it. Not entirely indicative of Barnum's life? The man himself would revel in the drama! Too over-the-top or schmaltzy? Have you ever been to the circus?! In this sense, the film is practically immune to harsh takes.In terms of execution, the music is wonderful and the visuals are stunning and always offering something new. The tone is a good mix between relentless energy, but also being able to slow down and appreciate the softer moments when needed. The ability to accomplish this makes for high emotion with every song.The cast is about as diverse as a circus show itself, what with the eclectic mix of Jackman, Williams Efron, Zendaya, & Rebecca Ferguson. They all perform very well and create a great chemistry on the screen.Personally, ""Greatest Showman"" will never be among my favorite films of all-time. I actually prefer a more straightforward, character-drama biopic approach. However, I can very easily see the appeal of the musical tact here, and enjoyed it enjoy to be thoroughly entertained. If you are more open to this crazier approach than I, the star ranking will likely tick even higher.","

"Hitchcoc","28 March 2018","When I saw the first trailer, I thought this would be fun. Then I started reading about it, especially local critics. I'm pretty picky and don't have much time for bad musicals. This pretty much floored me. The songs were pristine. The choreography was creative and fun. The casting worked wonderfully as did the special effects. I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The ""freaks"" were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun.","

"hertl","1 January 2018","I love the circus. I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.","

"excalibur107","10 September 2018","Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!","

This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything from the incredible, toe-tapping, music to the heartfelt, dream-filled, story-line!

I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself!

"sherylchilders82","30 September 2020","If you're a fan of musicals, get out your tissues, because this movie will have you crying ugly tears of joy. The real genius of The Greatest Showman, however, is the very currently relevant themes of diversity and class.In P.T. Barnum's day, class was something one was born into, with no escape, though the idea of class mobility was on the rise, thanks to the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. After the French and American revolutions, culture was on it's way to modern democracies. This movie is a nod to how entertainment began to reflect these changes. Today, classical entertainment like ballet and theater combines with the liberal and diverse entertainment of fringe ideas like the circus, to make what we consider modern entertainment, movies and television.We don't quite take for granted the diversity and acceptance we enjoy in our contemporary world (evident in ongoing racism and other discrimination like against LGBTQ people), but we are still a world away from the 19th century. But, Barnum was clearly ahead of his time, thanks to being an upwardly mobile individual himself (a rarity for the time), and having a bold and somewhat narcissistic personality.I think what is most striking about this story in this moment in history is that Barnum embraced and promoted an inevitable cultural phenomenon, even though he himself might not have been fully aware of its impact. His main motivation, after all, was to be a legitimate upper class person, not to unite the masses. He was simply a vessel through which that occurred. But, what happened with the circus in his time was really a precursor to what today is civil rights and modern democracy.","

"bkrauser-81-311064","24 December 2017","A musical movie about P.T. Barnum told with all great reverence to P.T. Barnum, featuring P.T. Barnum's Museum of Curiosities...so why not just make ""Barnum"" the stage musical? The answer to that question seems to be because then they couldn't get the guys from La La Land to do the music; fair enough. But if director Michael Gracey and screenwriter Jenny Bicks were set on custom making this celebration of glitz, chicanery and humbug they could have at least opted for a little more connective tissue.The Greatest Showman is a movie in moments, many of them great many more of them flaccid and empty. We're whisked through P.T.'s (Jackman) impoverished childhood in a single bound before settling on his happy marriage with wife Charity (Williams), and his two daughters (Johnson and Seely) who have grown to see their father as a hero. Tired of working to scrounge up a meager living, Barnum embarks on a risky entertainment venture and in due time, recruits his circus of curiosities and freaks.From that point on, the film's narrative relies heavily on its skin-deep celebration of acceptance and diversity. This is while it chugs along through Barnum's life from his start as a full-time huckster, to his falling out with Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (Ferguson). And while it would have been nice to say that the movie does a good job of linking theme with plot, I'm sorry to say none of it becomes a cohesive whole.This is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers. I mean turning P.T. Barnum's life into a celebration of kindness and humanity is like using William 'Boss' Tweed as a symbol for New York pride. This film being a musical, I was not expecting something exacting, but I was expecting at the very least a keen acknowledgement that the legacy of P.T. Barnum isn't all razzle-dazzle. Yet this film makes him out to look like a saint; a man of untold potential who uses ""truthful hyperbole"" to provide for his loving family - A man of conviction, of love and of just wanting to put a smile on your face.Framed in virtually any other way, Barnum would be the villain - enticing his young protégé Phillip (Efron) to ""live a little,"" and abandon his family to come join the circus. Belittling a theater critic with insults masquerading as flaccid, fortune cookie, self-help wisdom and enticing circus ""freaks"" to stand out and express themselves while closing the door on them the moment he's among the rich and famous. The film's show-stopping tune ""This is Me"" takes place at this moment but because the film is too scared to make its hero anything more complicated than a fancily folded cocktail napkin, the moment feels like the side characters are just letting off steam.What ultimately saves this movie from being a complete waste of a Saturday night is the choreography. Every poppy show tune and love ballad brings with it entire body shots of twirling, leaping perfection, conjuring memories of the physical feats of the cast of West Side Story (1961). Not satisfied with the traditional, the film continues to build its momentum with incredibly fancy footwork and some truly death defying trapeze choreography on the part of Zendaya and Zac Efron.There's imagination in the frame and a lot of it, but largely due to the film's complete inability to marry subject with tone, The Greatest Showman is far from great. Rather than being a worthy successor to Moulin Rouge! (2001) this picture winds up feeling like Newsies (1992) without a Crutchy. And let's face it; the only thing we really remember about that movie was there was a character named Crutchy.","

"austin0731","20 December 2017","I truly feel that there was a missed opportunity here with the greatest showman, it had great talent, music, costume design and an overall aura that feels like an extravaganza yet somehow it still falls short.If you have seen the trailer you have likely already seen the film, there were brilliant songs and likeable characters for sure but at the end of the day the storytelling was horrendously lacking. Which is as I have said a terrible shame seeing as there was a brilliant story about acceptance and prejudice right there yet the film never seems to fully capitalize. Much like Barnum's circus was described by the characters in this film this film is definitely likeable but at the end of the day, a cheesy, popcorn shoving flick. This film can also be described as a series of single moments of brilliance, when the film really utilized the musical aspects it really presents these visually stunning scenes yet, outside of those moments this is a very spotty film with an incoherent narrative. Indeed, the film seems to jump from scene to scene, moment to moment without any worthwhile character development or motive and without establishing much story points. While the movie had characters that were physically fleshed out and unique they weren't given much time for characterization except for few individual characters, as a result many of the characters seem more like caricatures then characters with personality and heart, which is something that the film truly needs. It almost seems like because the characters were so individually stylized physically they didn't see a need to narratively build their characters.Then again, those moments and bursts of energy in the film were just so well done that makes the film something that cannot be simply dismissed, a true shame. The greatest showman thrives at depicting the human spirit and tenacity yet fails to deliver a story with a coherent story and focus. But in there somewhere is a great film that sadly was not what the end result was. If the greatest showman could better build to character revelations and the main romance story with meatier character motives that truly connects those individually great moments I believe we do have something great here.","

"ccamp89","26 February 2018","Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.The strength of these musical sequences is enough to save the film from being bad, and is even almost enough to outweigh the many, many flaws... but not quite. Firstly, the film is attractive to look at to be sure, but it is at times so incredibly glossy that it feels like you're watching a shampoo or jewelry commercial. Sure, it's going for that fairy tale feel, but at times the sheen and shimmer is a little too blinding. And that high-gloss polish is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the incredibly superficial quality of the story and its characters. It's disappointing because this story is genuinely interesting and has the potential for a lot of moral exploration that is completely passed over. Again, I get that this is a musical and a family film, but that doesn't mean it has to be vapid and stupid (see: La La Land). I found it extremely troubling that the film completely ignored the moral quandary of whether Barnum was helping these ""unique"" people, or exploiting them for his own fame and fortune. These characters never even question his intent, viewing the situation as Barnum helping to ""put them out there"", gain them social acceptance, and create a ""family"", where in reality they're quite clearly being taken advantage of in a way that is arguably more reprehensible morally than the protesters who mock them. It's a truly glaring omission from the film that saps so much potential substance from the story.Contributing to the superficial feeling of the film is another all-to common problem that modern American family films suffer from: the pacing is way too fast. It's like the studios are afraid people will be bored by their films, and thus they design them to speed through plot points and character development in a way that ends up suffocating the life from it. Sure this approach makes the film feel lively and exciting, but it also robs it of actual, meaningful character interactions and development. The result is a film that feels like all dessert and no main course - a bowl of chocolate ice cream sure tastes great but it's no substitute for a satiating meal.Another nitpick that bothered me enough that I have to mention it: why is a renowned 19th Century opera singer belting out a Celine Dion-esque pop tune for an adoring ""high brow"" audience in a classic theater? That scene was almost laughable in its absurdity. And although it was by far the worst offender, I would say in general the music in the film, while catchy, did clash somewhat with the period.Honestly, I really should be giving this film a lower score. Somehow I enjoyed it quite a bit even in the face of the many fundamental issues, which is a testament to the strength of the best sequences. Still this is a deeply flawed film that, for all its visual splendor and admittedly intoxicating energy, amounts to little more than a sugar rush.Strong 2.5/5","

"classicsoncall","8 August 2019","There are a host of production numbers and scenes that are pure spectacle, and one can't say enough about the incredibly talented cast. Hugh Jackman shows a side I've never seen before in terms of athleticism and singing ability, and it's always a pleasant surprise to discover such talent in an actor who's not particularly known for it. The scene that really popped for me was when Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) and Anne Wheeler (Zendaya) performed their flying trapeze-like choreography during the 'Rewrite the Stars' sequence. It was way beyond magical and for me was the most entertaining segment in a picture filled with them. Though the depiction of Phineas T. Barnum (Jackman) here was almost entirely fictional, there's no question that the story, in the words of New York Herald writer W.D. Wheeler (Eric Anderson), was in the truest sense, a 'celebration of humanity'. I'm not big on movie musicals, and wasn't aware that this was one when I picked it up, but it left me spirited and enthusiastic with it's vibrant energy. It was as much fun as a three ring circus.","

"bkoganbing","13 May 2018","It's ironic that this musical celebration of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum comes
out just when the last tangible legacy of his life comes to an end. The plot of
The Greatest Showman ends just when Barnum gets the idea that he just needs
a large tent to house his attractions. We never see Barnum&Bailey's circus come
to fruition, we never even meet James P. Bailey in this film.. Their circus merged
with that of the Ringling family and it was Ringling Brothers&Barnum&Bailey
circus that traveled the world for over a century. Last year the troupe finally
broke up as the circus became an institution confined to history. Still Phineas
Taylor Barnum is still a name that set a standard for promotion.The Greatest Showman looks a whole lot like in style and substance with the
Cole Porter tribute film It's DeLovely. But that film had a library of a song catalog to score that film from its subject. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote the songs for The Greatest Showman and This Is Me gained an Oscar nomination for Best Song, one of the very few now written for that rarest of
film lately, the original screen musical.A lot of people have brought P.T. Barnum to the screen and Hugh Jackman in 
his performance joins such folks as Wallace Beery, Burt Lancaster, and Michael
Crawford among others. Jackman doesn't take a back seat to any of these.
Two refugees from the Disney Studio, Zac Efron and Zendaya have great parts
to exhibit their musical talents. Rebecca Ferguson plays The Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind who represented Barnum's successful bid for respectability. She has a nice song to sing dubbed by Loren Allred in Never 
Enough. But it might have been wiser and more accurate to have gotten some
soprano to sing a familiar public domain aria instead. What you see here is
most definitely not an authentic Jenny Lind.There's no more Scudder's Museum where Barnum exhibited his sideshow acts.
Jenny Lind arrived too soon for her voice to be captured on Mr. Edison's new
phonograph, and now the circus is of the past. But The Greatest Showman is
still quite a tribute to the one who really invented the concept of show business, P.T. Barnum.","

"harrisonlundy","25 December 2017","I think critics are missing the whole premise of the film. I never really saw this as a biography to begin with, but a fun, upbeat historical fiction musical. Each musical number had a fitting mood for the scene, especially the opening number where it was especially satisfying to see the visual aspects of the film. I saw this film as a mixture of the pop-style mood of Hamilton, mixed with the visual joyride that was Pippin. It works for me perfectly. I never really felt the runtime at all because the musical parts of the show were enough to keep me satisfied. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman definitely brought my favorite performances, with Waitress actress Keala Settle delivering some satisfying vocal delivery. You can definitely feel the La La Land levels of genius lyrics here. As for story, I found myself telling the characters ""NO DON'T DO THAT"" or ""YESSS"" very softly in the theater. There were even a few moments where I smiled and laughed out loud.
In the words of Rachel Bloom, ""the modern musical is an American invention, and it is still alive and well."" It's rare that we get to see wonderfully crafted theatrical musicals such as this and La La Land. This is also something I think many critics fail to see. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.","

"fletcherc21","22 December 2017","The Greatest Showman is a flashy biopic of circus pioneer PT Barnum. Unfortunately, PT Barnum gets the Hollywood treatment and it is a shallow movie that portrays Barnum as a champion of the downtrodden just as much as the profiteer that he was. Hugh Jackman's version of Barnum would never say ""There's a sucker born every minute.""Of even greater disappointment was the music. The writers of La La Land's incredible soundtrack follow it up with a disappointing set of songs that all sound the same. If you shuffled the songs around in this movie, I'm not sure anyone would really notice. The only song I can remember much of is The Greatest Show, and that's just because they repeatedly come back to it. Even Golden Globe nominated This Is Me sounds like the rest of them. It was also clear that for the most part the actors are not the ones singing, and those that are recorded in a studio and then lip synced, which while understandable, should not be noticeable. There is a solid cast and they all do fine, particularly Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. The dance numbers definitely feel like they are from a 60s musical like West Side Story or Mary Poppins rather than a modern musical. It is also shot and constructed reasonably well, but it just not gripping.","

The songs are all in just one musical style, and it's the same style as in La La Land, and I found the lack of variety tiring. (OTOH, if you like the breathy style of current pop music, you will like the movie a lot more than I did.)I knew it was a fictional takeoff on Barnum's life, so I didn't mind hearing Jenny Lind singing songs composed for the movie. But giving her a weak and breathy voice, instead of the clear and brilliant voice that helped make her so famous, was a step too far. Over 300 credits in Special Effects speaks to an over-reliance on FX at the expense of performance, and that fits my overall impression.","

This time, they got it wrong...""The Greatest Showman"" is an uplifting, joyous experience that we all need, now more than ever. The musical numbers are glorious and the plot, while not historically accurate (if you want a history lesson, rent ""Dunkirk"",) is heartfelt and engrossing. It is a film that families can enjoy together, devoid of the sappiness and goofy grownups that infest most family fare. And, the greatest present of all: you feel wonderful at the end!Within the film, an entertainment critic who describes Mr. Barnum's offerings as ""a circus of humbug"" asks whether it bothers him that all he offers is fake. Barnum, referring to his customers, replies, ""Do their smiles look fake?"" No, they don't - nor do the ones in the theater. And those smiles are reaffirmed through the round of applause that many audiences bestow upon the film at its conclusion.Gather the family, enjoy the music and leave the theater feeling better than when you came in.

Some of this is to be expected, as you can't have a movie on a showman extraordinaire and one of the most significant figures in entertainment history without a large amount of pizzazz.However, the movie doesn't really give us much of Barnum's history or motivations. The main focus seems to be on cramming as many song and dance numbers into the movie as possible, at the expense of any plot. For every minute of plot or character development you have four minutes of musical numbers.To crown it all, the music is poor and irritating. Every musical number sounds like something from a made-for-kids animated Disney movie, rather than a biopic. The movie is set in the mid-1800s yet we have ultra-contemporary numbers. It is quite jarring and negates any semblance of historical accuracy, credibility or substance.","

"SnoopyStyle","8 March 2018","Charity Hallett (Michelle Williams) and P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) are childhood sweethearts and loving parents to two girls. As a child, his father worked as a lowly tailor for her wealthy family. After his father's death, he struggled to survive on the streets of New York. When they reached adulthood, Charity leaves the comforts of her family home for his love. He lies to a banker for the money to buy a wax museum. Eventually, he turns it into a circus of oddities. He recruits successful black sheep playwright Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) who falls in love with trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). He is desperate for high society approval and promotes high class singing sensation Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson).This is a brash and broadest of Broadway musical. It is big and melodramatic. Obviously, Hugh is the perfect man for the job. This is a movie that knows what it is and is happy to play it to the fullest. Coming into this, my biggest fear is an easy lackadaisical treatment of historical facts. How big and broad this is actually helps to alleviating that fear. Nobody will mistake this for a documentary. It is to be taken as the lightest of entertainment with the broadest of emotions. I would have liked a reference to ""There's a sucker born every minute"" even if it's not from P.T.'s mouth. Maybe I missed that in the movie. I like all the actors especially Jackman. It hits some great notes. I especially like the trapeze dance between Anne and Phillip. Mostly, I'm disappointed with the wooden acting from Ferguson. The most compelling part of her role is the on stage singing. I wonder if an actual singer would be infinitely more fitting. I simply don't believe her singing and the role doesn't ask much in terms of acting. Overall, it's a big musical and it doesn't want to be anything else.","

"vchimpanzee","6 June 2021","The movie starts with this pounding. Oh, the noise, noise, noise! If this movie was set in the 19th century, why couldn't it also have 19th century music?But some people, maybe most people, will enjoy the spectacular opening scene, even if it's not the kind of music I would choose. Very talented dancers and acrobats. And they do it again, several times.The story of young P. T. Barnum is hard to watch but it explains a lot, and once the unpleasantness is over, there's a really cute romantic story and whoever does his singing does a really good job.It's pretty amazing to watch what Barnum does as an adult, and Hugh Jackman does a great job with the role, though he doesn't quite have the kind of range that would be expected of an Oscar-worthy performance. That's partly due to the writing, I suppose. Barnum experiences a lot of tragedy but there's not a really powerful scene where he has to react to that. Mostly Jackman just shows how wonderful a showman Barnum was.I didn't know how much of this was the truth, and so much is different, but then this was a man known for deception.And once again, music is NOT from the century where the action took place. But everyone besides me is enjoying it. Barnum's little daughters in particular are having such a good time.A memorable scene involves General Tom Thumb. And Queen Victoria. Knowing how proper that woman was, I expected a disaster. Things went quite well. And no, apparently that scene never happened.What a shame Barnum didn't truly respect his ""freaks"", even though he seemed to think he did. At least that's the way it is depicted. But he can't very well have them associating with dignified, proper people. And they do react.I found one brief scene involving Yahya Abdul-Mateen II to be memorable. His performance there, though brief, was so different, and something about the camera angle made him look dignified, as a proud man of African descent.Knowing the truth, I'd like to have seen more of the relationship with General Tom Thumb, and how he truly contributed to making Barnum a success. How he was discovered here was so different, but it was an interesting way to do it. It just wasn't the truth.Yes, he was The Greatest Showman. Flawed, but very good at what he did.","

"lavatch","26 April 2018","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""The Greatest Showman,"" the director, who is a specialist in music videos, asserted that the music was ""the heart and soul of the film."" At the same time, he continued, ""we wanted it to feel classical."" Unfortunately, the musical score for this film did not have any sort of classical feel. It was purely contemporary music and rather uninspiring. In fact, all of the musical numbers tended to sound the same.With Hugh Jackman, supported by a fine ensemble cast, the character interpretation of the promoter P. T. Barnum was engaging. The screenplay sought to unfold the nineteenth-century Horatio Alger myth of a little street urchin's rise to riches through industry and perseverance. But the self-made man theme became caught up in a personal drama of Barnum's insecurity as the son of the tailor, who never overcame his feeling of social inferiority.The film took Barnum through various stages in his entrepreneurial career. Stage #1 was the Barnum Museum of natural history that was a flop. Even Barnum's young daughter recognized that his museum was lifeless.Stage #2 was his attempt at creating a ""curiosity"" show with a conglomeration of human ""oddities"" that he recruited. The filmmakers sought unconvincingly to turn Barnum's creative idea into the theme of diversity and the universal brotherhood of man.Stage #3 included the legitimate acts that Barnum developed in his circus. It is not clear what the fictional playwright character Philip Carlyle contributed to this stage, other than to fall in love with the trapeze artist and give the film a romantic subplot.Stage #4 was the time when Barnum sought to become ""artistic"" in producing a prestigious touring show starring Miss Jenny Lind (""The Swedish Nightingale""). This subplot was strained when Miss Lind, who felt a kinship with the insecure Barnum, implausibly cancelled her tour because, apparently, Barnum would not sleep with her. Stage #5: The famed Barnum & Bailey tent show. The film was unsuccessful in attempting to turn Barnum into a kind of Citizen Kane, wherein we are instructed into his lost ""Rosebud"" from his youth. The Barnum of this film is depicted as a kid with a dream, driven by the creative impulse that ""men suffer more from imagining too little than too much."" The story of the historical P.T. Barnum is much more prosaic than the one depicted in this film. Barnum said famously that ""the noblest heart is that of making others happy."" Barnum's story was a uniquely American saga of a hustler, who tapped into the desires of Americans for entertainment and, more than anything, was motivated to make money....just like the hustlers who made this schlock film entitled ""The Greatest Showman""!","

Well it is a musical, not a documentary. It still was a well written story. One critic complained that the movie turned Barnum into a saint. Not true! He was flawed in the movie, at times uncaring or selfish. The scenes of the circus were just amazing. The choreography was very well done. The songs also are excellent and performed by very talented singers. Listen to the songs on youtube. Try ""Never Enough"" and ""The Greatest Showman."" The movie also shows the importance of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. The songs are very catchy, and will stay in your head, and the movie is uplifting. This movie was Hugh Jackman's dream, it took 7.5 years to make.

However his lack of experience shows in the dramatic moments and with the narrative. The songs are rather bland apart from the Oscar nominated, This is Me that has a barnstorming performance from Keala Settle.The story is a little thin but zips along in an entertaining fashion.

"Troy_Campbell","29 December 2017","Hugh Jackman is as complete a package as you can get in Hollywood. Not only can he dance, sing and act, but he also possesses levels of nice-guy charisma most A-listers can only dream of. It's no shock then that this glitzy musical employs him to play the eponymous circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, an ambitious dreamer who pushes social boundaries to deliver a theatrical extravaganza others couldn't even imagine. Centring around Barnum's use of outcasts and ""oddities"" to draw in crowds, the film has a quirky edge to its otherwise mainstream appeal; the traditional song-and-dance numbers are smattered with colourful characters (and a smidge of offbeat humour) to keep it fresh. The musical sequences are impressively choreographed and often very affecting, the most memorable being the show stopping ""This Is Me"" led by Keala Settle as Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz, closely followed by ""The Other Side"", a clever two-hander between Jackman and Zac Efron. Jackman is clearly in his element belting out tunes and dancing up a storm, but he's also given wonderful support from all involved, including Efron as his plucky apprentice, Michelle Williams as his super-patient wife, and Zendaya as a racially vilified trapeze artist. The movie succeeds a lot less as a biography though; Barnum's rise amidst risky business ventures and family sacrifices is touched upon but never explored, missing an opportunity to delve deep into the life of a clearly intriguing person. It might be a little too conventional to convert those who aren't fans of the genre, but with a charming cast, splendid set pieces and sweet-natured vibe, The Greatest Showman is a pleasingly fun and accessible musical.","

"richardchatten","16 January 2022","The first screen biography of Phineas T. Barnum since 'The Mighty Barnum' with Wallace Beery in 1934 is a typical 21st Century musical hybrid of meticulous Victorian decor and costume and extremely contemporary declamatory singing and knock 'em dead choreography and camerawork. All rather exhausting.","

"Ramascreen","20 December 2017","O, my god! I knew I was a sucker for musicals but The Greatest Showman just exceeds all my expectations. The songs are catchy, the dance numbers are hypnotic, all the performers look and sound fantastic, and they're all such great singers. None of them fumbles, none of them sound dreadful like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables because almost all of the ensemble in The Greatest Showman can carry a tune. The story is a bit basic but that's ok, it was always designed to be a feel-good movie that's triumphant, extravagant and joyous.Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum who came from nothing and marries the love of his life, Charity, played by Michelle Williams. Charity comes from a privileged family, while P.T. Barnum grew up poor. So now comes a chance where P.T. can finally prove that he's more than just some dirt kid from the street, he opens up a circus spectacle that became a big sensation but his ambitions and his desperate need for approval makes him unable to see the joy and happiness that are already there right in front of him.First of all, what you need to know is that this is not a straight up biopic of the actual P.T. Barnum because the actual P.T. Barnum had his controversies. So what THE GREATEST SHOWMAN basically does is take the character P.T. Barnum and put a spin on his story, including his touring with opera singer, Jenny Lind. Zac Efron and Zendaya's roles are that of a young love but their subplot also ties nicely with the drama of Hugh Jackman and Michelle William's characters. And I freakin 'love all the songs featured in this film, I have the soundtrack by the way and I kept listening to it for hours on end, put them on repeat and listen to them again the next day. So addictive. Written by the same songwriting team behind ""La La Land"" but I must say that ""The Greatest Showman"" songs are way better, they stay in your head for days. Kudos on the dance choreographies too, everything about this film's music is so in sync harmoniously, the songs match what is going on at that moment in the story, they compliment the characters' emotions. Another thing that you need to know is that even though the story is set in the '1800s, the music is not meant to sound like it comes from that era, the style is more contemporary or hip-hop, it's meant to give you that grand majestic impression, more like Las Vegas rather than Broadway, if that comparison helps.This of course is not Hugh Jackman's first rodeo in the world of musical, Zac Efron and Zendaya are talented in that department too, so what you have here is a group of talents that are highly skilled at dazzling you with their moves and vocal chords, it helps that easy on the eyes as well. Jackman in particular has that bravado presence about him. But don't be mistaken, this is not some Oscar worthy achievement ala Les Miserables, although.. if it does get nominated, it deserves to be recognized for at least the costumes and the production design, but THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is all about entertaining you with bright colors and it's all about making your foot tap while at the same time celebrating entrepreneurial spirit and celebrating diversity which are something I can definitely relate to. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is charming, it's uplifting, it makes you smile, it's a great way to end the year on a high note.-- Rama's Screen --","

"ThomasDrufke","3 January 2018","Same lyricists as La La Land (one of my favorite films of all time)? Hugh Jackman going back to his musical roots? A musical surrounding around a circus with plenty of bombastic visuals and acts? Count me in. My interest in The Greatest Showman kept growing with every trailer and TV spot I saw. The final product is a crowd pleasing but ultimately disappointingly bland and cheesy musical loosely based on the infamous P.T. Barnum.Let me start off by talking about the things I liked. The music is fantastic and nothing short of inspirational and surprisingly moving. Everything from the opening number which sees Barnum as a young boy imagining a ""Greatest Show"", to the jaw-dropping ballad ""Never Enough"", to the likely Oscar winner ""This is Me"", and to my favorite track ""A Million Dreams"". The music is undeniably catchy and exactly what a movie like this needs. In fact, I could have used the film to have more numbers and be closer to a traditional all-sung musical rather than a musical number every scenes. So even though I didn't care for the rest of the film, the numbers are worth the price of admission alone.My main problem with the film, which seems to be a lot of people's issue, is that every single problem that comes up gets solved within minutes. This film is all about struggle and coming from nothing to achieve your dreams. A universal and worthy theme in any type of movie, but it only works if you can experience the struggle along with the triumph. Unfortunately, the story is muddied with plenty of character struggles that create obstacles for the protagonists, but are merely brushed aside a few minutes later with a quick scene.It's also worth noting just how cheesy this film is. I don't like using that term loosely, especially since I usually appreciate ""good cheesiness in films"". Heck there's plenty of musicals I've seen that have a charming cheese to them. But when a film has inconsequential struggles and contrived plot points, it's hard to get passed moments of pure unnecessary cheese. The film has grown on me a little bit since I saw it a few days back, with the soundtrack being the overwhelming reason for me rating this is as a positive review. If I could watch only the musical numbers and skip past every other scene, I think I would buy it on blu-ray. 6.0/10","

"banglainey","25 March 2018","I am quite annoyed that this movie has such a high rating.I felt insulted by it's simplicity, it's lack of dialogue, and the dialogue that was there being terrible, it's lackluster character development and the incessant looping of the music. Seriously the music was like seven words just changed around throughout the entire movie. It was two hours of looping of a really bad song with a few lines of horrible dialogue sprinkled in there. The dancing was lots of spinning and arm-waving. You get to know NO characters in the movie other than Barnum. Every other character is just filler, fodder, empty actors with no story development, who are just there to wave their arms in garish makeup. I feel like a lot of people were just maybe fooled by the poppy, upbeat tune and the constant spinning and swirling going on that they failed to notice how bad this movie is!The slap in the face here is that I LOVE musicals. And I hated this one.","

"phd_travel","8 January 2018","It's great that Hugh Jackman has another chance to fill the screen with his singing and dancing talent. And he is truly the star of this interesting biopic of PT Barnum. His strong vocals and energy propel the show on and the story keeps you wanting to see what happens. Michelle Williams plays his wife. Her voice seems thin and weak compared to his and she should have been dubbed. Rebecca Fergusson looks good as the diva Jenny Lind and even though she is lip syncing she moves you when her character is singing. Her face with it's old fashioned beauty is just right for the period. Zac Efron is alright if a bit small sized compared to the rest of the cast. At least he can sing and dance. Not much chemistry with Zendaya. The weak part of this movie is the music itself. The songs are derivative and the lyrics are banal relying on repetition of simplistic tunes and lyrics over and over again. The composing team is tragically untalented. The style of the music and songs are totally out of place with the setting. What a waste of such singing talent.Things slow down during the rather forced dramatic climax.Worth watching for Hugh","

"lord-of-the-lez","22 August 2020","On the one hand, this movie is a fun and entertaining spectacle. The songs are catchy and the choreography is amazing to watch. This movie would be perfect as a stage performance. I will be listening to the soundtrack on repeat, for sure.On the other hand, it comes across as too heavy-handed in its themes and was so fast-paced that you barely have any time to register the emotions in any of the scenes. This movie also does a lot of ""telling"" (or rather, singing) rather than showing. The characters will say how they feel, but the movie has no time to stop and really show it. In this way, the songs may come across as insincere and cheesy a lot of the time. But, like I said, it's mostly a pacing issue. If this movie was given more time to slow down in between songs, it could've made a huge emotional impact.I also think this movie was a missed opportunity to explore the interesting, complicated personality of the real P.T. Barnum. Instead, the movie turned him into a Walt Disney-esque figure with a dream, who grows up to make that dream come true. The real Barnum was a shady, savvy businessman who was also a creative innovator, a genius entrepreneur, an anti-slavery politician, and an overall controversial public figure. A lot more interesting than the watered-down version we get from this movie.Still, it's a fun watch. And if you're a fan of musicals, you won't be disappointed for sure. It's a spectacle, but it's not exactly the ""greatest show.""","

"Mike_Devine","8 April 2018","As cinematic musicals experience a sort of renaissance, it can't be expected that every film will be equally beloved by critics and audiences alike. 'The Greatest Showman' is a prime example of this.The conflicted, unorthodox life story of one of this country's most prolific entertainers - P.T. Barnum - is set against a full soundtrack of rising numbers featuring full choruses and classic-meets-new age music. While the public - including families - more or less fell in love with this ensemble, leading to an over-performance at the box office, the Rotten Tomatoes crowd were less impressed.For one, 'Showman' features an identifiable pop culture icon (Barnum), bankable stars (Jackman, Efron, Williams, Zendaya) and catchy songs written by the same cast of characters responsible for the music in another crowd-pleaser, 'La La Land.' All of these elements make a film that can connect with audiences unlike more sophisticated, elaborate films. Sure, it can be argued that Barnum's life is simplified to the point that it almost feels as trivial as the beard on Keala Settle's bearded woman. But this isn't intended to be a biographical drama.Again, it's the music the is the glue that holds 'Showman' together. Kicking off with the energetic 'The Greatest Show' and ending on the rousing finale of 'From Now On,' there are plenty of hits in here that are enough to keep audiences humming along long after the curtains close. Perhaps the standout, though, is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of the operatic vocalist Jenny Lind, who's voiced by Loren Allred on the power ballad ""Never Enough,"" which is sure to become a classic to be sung in singing competitions all over the world.Sure, 'The Greatest Showman' is a bit cheesy at times, and would be a shell of itself if it was not a musical. But the final result stands on its own as an impressive, memorable entry in the 20th Century Fox catalogue.","

"jadepietro","1 January 2018","JIM'S REVIEW: The Greatest Showman has its heart in the right place, but it unfortunately never achieves its musical goal. It invests a lot, and I mean a lot, of talent and hard work with very little dividend. The songs are foot-stomping, uplifting, and hummable tunes, but become derivative imitations of themselves. Every musical number sounds and looks alike with no modulation. Even the ballads are slow-downed versions of other songs in the film. The original score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul lacks range, a deliberate sameness creeps in for most musical moments, but their music definitely delivers in energetic peppiness with toe-tapping ""feel-good"" form. They are experts in writing clever ""hooks"". The modern choreography is more 2017 variety than 1917 period but is very well done. Kudos to Ashley Wallen and his accomplished dancers for stomping their way into your hearts.Nathan's Crowley's lovely production design sings out, as does the costumes created by Ellen Mirojnick. Michael Gracey's solid direction is fluid and successfully captures the nostalgic musical origins of the big Hollywood musicals of yore (although think what these filmmakers could have done with Cy Coleman's far superior Broadway musical gem, Barnum!).The major problem with the film, and it is a major issue, is the paper thin plot that follows the most predictable of story-lines. Whenever the singing and dancing stops, so does the film. The screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon is a real letdown, with underwritten characters and petty conflicts all under the big top in a very conventional way. Their script is mostly an outline to serve the musical moments and rarely advances the plot. The relationships are all strained beyond reality and each character seems to be a mere prop device to lead into the next musical interlude.The casting is a mixed bag also. Hugh Jackman is really the greatest showman, more so than Barnum himself. He is a natural song and dance man. Watching him move with such grace and charisma is almost worth the price of admission (but there is that awful script, remember). Michelle Williams is his loving wife, Charity, and she is given so little to do to showcase her musical talents. Zac Efron as rich playboy, Phillip Carlyle, tries hard, but just doesn't have the musical ability, no matter how they edit the movie. Zendaya plays his love interest and their love story seems like a second thought. Their romance may convince a giddy twelve-year-old girl about the things we do for love, but it left me questioning the things they did for a paycheck. Perhaps the weakest link is the usually dependable Rebecca Ferguson, totally miscast as the operatic Jenny Lind. Supposedly this world renown singer and crowd-pleasing attraction to Barnum's circus of oddities, wowed the patrons back then. However, the singing on the screen could never come near a high C. Ms. Ferguson's performance is more like a B-flat. (In creating such an important supporting role, it is beyond me why the filmmakers couldn't find an attractive and trained opera singer to fill the bill. Go to the Met and take your pick.)So, even though the movie is entertaining on a musical level, The Greatest Showman is plain hokum, albeit nice-looking hokum. There is plenty of razzle-dazzle on display although it is just painted cardboard and glitter that remains. As Barnum would say, ""There is one born every minute."" (Even though Ms. Lind could not hit that high C, the film's earned that grade from this critic.)","

"Horst_In_Translation","10 January 2018","""The Greatest Showman"" is a new 2017 movie and one of the most talked about musicals of the year. It runs for 105 minutes and was written by Oscar winner Bill Condon and Emmy winner Jenny Bicks. These two are probably more known than director Michael Gracey. The big star, however, here is lead actor Hugh Jackman playing the title character P.T. Barnum, a man with a poor background whose talent, tolerance and willpower turn him into one of the most creative artists from his generation. Next to him playing the women in his life, we got Oscar nominee Michelle Williams and Golden Globe nominee Rebecca Ferguson. And there's Zac Efron and Zendaya in it too getting their own love story for their characters and these are in it to attract young audiences for sure, but to make sure it's gonna be more than another High School Musical we got the likes of Jackman etc. Efron and Zendaya were okay I guess, I expected worse perhaps. But the huge star is Jackman. I think without him this would have been a pretty mediocre film at times, but he elevates the material by so much. Sure the film is still miles worse than Les Mis for example, but it's still a decent watch most of the time. We'll see if Jackman can get in at the Oscars once again and I sure hope so. He is by far the best musical blockbuster actor for lead characters we got. Also they made a really good job to close the age gap between him and Williams. This film won a Golden Globe recently, but I must say I am not too big on the winning song and that I preferred most others to be honest. But that's just subjective of course and I also don't know how many of the others were original. Still another huge success for the La La Land song composers to strike again.Another weakness was the rushed-in jealousy / potential cheating story line that ended as quickly as it began and had zero significance overall really. And maybe to a lesser extent also the fire story. If he could expand globally, then he sure can rebuild his dream. Or the sudden loss of money near the end. But it is easy to overlook these flaws with how amazing most of the music was, especially the very first and last song. And the characters were also pretty interesting in this underdog story. They did not try to constantly include try-hard jokes (and the few funny references like the critic felt pretty smart), but let music and story speak for themselves which was a brilliant decision really. The actors are all good, also the lesser known ones. Nothing wrong about the visual side either, costumes, sets and makeup were all top-notch and I hope the recognition the film may possibly find at the Oscars in these areas can extend to Jackman getting in too. His P.T. Barnum is the heart and soul of a movie that I found inspiring to watch and that also creatively inspired me somehow while watching. And this really is the biggest compliment you can make a movie. Of course, I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","10 April 2018","There's an interesting story in here that would have been much better served as either a straight drama or comedy. Perhaps, it could have even still been a musical, so long as the real-life events were portrayed honestly and the characters were given some actual development, instead of the glorified and one-note representations we are given here. The point is that the problem I had with the piece isn't that its a musical (admittedly my least favourite genre) but that it isn't a particularly good one. Songs start seemingly out of nowhere and tend to head in that same direction, with only one or two actually representing a change within the characters or displaying their inner desires previously not communicated to the audience. The overall piece also can't seem to decide if it occupies that weird space where the world itself stops for a musical number, but it's essentially just for the audience, or if the flick wants the characters themselves to literally be singing (diegetically) within the scene. Instead, the film confusingly flutters between the two modes, sometimes within the same sequence, breaking any immersion that might've been felt. There were only one or two such sequences I thought were interestingly done, anyway. Its an odd choice for pop-style music in a period narrative, but one that could've worked it if was perhaps pushed further or done more cohesively. I will admit that one or two songs are catchy and entertaining in isolation. But the lack of connective tissue is even more inexcusable when you consider that most of the material just isn't that good. This would've certainly been better served as an album than a screen story. 4/10","

"isaacglover_05","27 December 2017","This movie, to me, was like an empty candy wrapper. Before watching the movie and after seeing the trailer, it looked like it was going to be something magnificent! It had:
Academy award winning lyricists - Benj Pasek and Justin Paul
Academy award nominated actor - Hugh Jackman
Academy Award nominated actress - Michelle Williams
An inspiring true story about acceptance, love, relationships, family and sticking with what you value most. The cinematography looked absolutely astounding in the trailer, the acting looked amazing, the directing looked amazing, just EVERYTHING looked amazing in the trailer. It gave me goosebumps I must admit. So, it's a small wonder that I was excited to go see this movie as soon as I could.However, that was just the wrapping of this promisingly sweet and delicious candy that I was looking forward to indulging. So when you open the wrapper and seeing that there's nothing inside it, you would feel quite disappointed wouldn't you?
Well that feeling was similar to how I felt when walking out of the cinema. The cast and the characters are probably this movie's strongest point:
Zac Efron really came to his own in this film. Not being a big fan, I must say I ended up finding myself quite excited when seeing him on screen, His character was intelligent, classy, knew what was best for him and had his moral compass set straight (though a little bit crooked at the start of the film). 
Hugh and Michelle were great of course. Rachael Ferguson was absolutely stunning, Zendaya was extremely impressive, and the circus ensemble were great in each of their own way. 
The cinematography was extremely impressive, the first shot of the film already reeling me in in what I thought was going to be the movie of the year. But that's where it ended. 
I understand where the lyricists and the composers of this film were aiming for a more modern feel with their music as a way to express Barnum's ahead-of-time ideas. But the 1800's setting mixed with 2000's music was definitely not the way to go, especially when each song started to sound the same: the structure being too similar to the point where you could predict when the chorus was coming up, when the beat was going to drop, when the texture was going to thicken. Hell, you could almost sing the lyrics before it was even sung! The messages with each song were very similar. Although they were inspiring messages, it didn't shy away from the fact that they ended up being quite redundant. Michelle Williams' solo was impressive, though, and was definitely a standout from the rest of the music. The story was predictable - a man coming from a troubled life, yearning to make something of himself. He eventually gets there, getting married and having a couple of kids along the way, but of course let's the fame get to his head and therefore slowly strains the relationships he has built around him. He of course eventually picks himself back up after a few reminiscing pieces of music as well as inspiring ""Nothing will bring me down"" scores, and lives happily ever after.It's been done before time and time again, and setting it in the 1800's and making it a musical will not shy away from the fact that the formula is getting really old. So this is my humble opinion on ""The Greatest Showman"" and what I had to say on the matter. It's not the worst movie of 2017 but it definitely isn't the best movie of the year either. It will be forgotten once it gets out of cinemas I believe.","

"planktonrules","14 July 2018","""The Greatest Showman"" is a highly fictionalized, colorful and loud bio-pic about P.T.

Perhaps it's due to my age...perhaps I am a curmudgeon...all I know is that the film was too intense, too brash and too loud for me. Now it's NOT because I dislike musicals...far from it. But this one is so in your face and abrasive that you'll likely either find yourself pulled into it OR you'll feel like screaming because it's an assault on all your senses....I am in that second group.

"reubenmark","1 January 2018","First off, I feel I need to preface this by saying I am not some heartless jockish type who violently hates musicals or spectacular movies. I am a great lover of musicals because of their potential to strengthen the emotional beats of any story through the majesty of song. Moments like ""City of Stars"" in La La Land, which beautifully depicts Seb's resignation in falling for Mia. Or Les Miserables ""I dreamed a dreamed"" that could melt even the coldest heart due to the plight of the completely defeated Flautine. My all time favorite musical, Fiddler on the Roof, is jammed packed with these moments, right from the start and the incredibly delicate yet spectacular world building opening of ""TRADITION!"" These musical moments were God damn earned by their story's plots and that is what is surely missing from The Great Showman.I honestly do not think it is possible to tell the back story of your protagonist as quickly as this movie does! It is a troubling trend nowadays to gloss over the set up of a films hero's life as quickly as possible just to get to the explosive dramatic action of the story, but telling us who and why we should care about a character is absolutely vital for the problems faced by that character to fully hit home. From the little I know about P.T Barnum he seemed to be this incredibly complex and interesting historical figure, so why not explore this in-depth? Do the film makers expect me to do my own deep dive into research into the man, inspired by their superficial exploration of him? I'm not out here looking to get homework after watching a movie, YOU DO THE HOMEWORK! And give me an authentic recollection of his life. It really is not hard and there will still be time for the musical numbers. And this is not only true for Barnum but so so many characters in this movie. You know you are lying to yourself if you did not feel like you wanted to know more about Zendaya's character? Where in the universe did this this incredible trapezes brother-sister duo come from? Indeed all the performers in Barnums circus were such wasted opportunities to help drive the message of the film home. At the very least they could have homed in on one, the bearded lady perhaps? I know those among you who love this movie are going to say that that would have slowed the ""hip and happening"" spectacle of this movie down but for the love of God its not hard work to script in same pieces of dialogue (or I don't know even possibly A SONG perhaps?) That gave us a feel for who these damn people are. But no f-that right? Who cares who they were, I mean its pretty obvious the type of life a bearded lady had, right?Now, you reading this may perceive me of being completely full of shit and some sort of film student, and you would be right! I am still very early on in my studies but the little I have learnt on crafting a story has taught me that every story needs to have an underlying meaning, a lesson the filmmaker wants to teach their audience and indeed themselves through a journey in the lives of characters. As my lecturer says to us, ""Tell the audience that two plus two equals eleven, then prove it to them!"" Writing stories that can inspire change in the world takes a ton of introspection, research, and diving deep into your own understanding and consciousness of a topic and then presenting your findings to the world and this is what annoys me the most with The Great Showman! If you were to take out the songs in this film it would honestly be the filmic equivalent of reading a Wikipedia page and that is such a shame because of the possibilities presented by the topic it was trying to explore. They could have explored race, the entertainment industry, exploitation, ambition, and presented us with an honest and educational finding on these universal issues, but instead they gave us a series of beautiful music videos. I am not making my point well here, but if you want to have a look at what true artistry in storytelling can lead to, check out this ""Lessons from a screenplay"" video about ""UP"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulm7bcB2xvYBut I am done complaining about this movie and I didn't mean to rain on all your parades but as a hopefully future filmmaker is worries me that such an artificial story-line can fly under the radar so easily by just adding heaps and heaps of spectacle. If you truly are a lover of films, you should demand with all you have that the men and woman who are charges to creating the scripts are forced to be as accountable as the incredible work done by cinematographers, sound designers, editors, colourists, visual effects artists, production and costume designers, music composers, and ofcourse the actors; all of whom completely and utterly killed the game in The Great Showman, it just a shame the writer put in such a shitty effort. And go easy on the critics, they love movies just as much as you do...","

"ivantheeditor","19 November 2022","They dont make em like these anymore. This gem right here is exactly why people love movies! For a moment there, I forgot the world we live in and I was transported into another dimension. A magical one. Where anything is possible. With characters that were larger than life yet relatable and songs that made you feel feelings you forgot you could feel. This was more than a movie. It was an experience. The kind of experience that moves you and changes you. You're not going to watch this and then go back to whatever you were doing before this. No. You're going to listen to the soundtrack. You're going to watch behind the scenes videos on youtube of how they made it. Because let me tell you - this was a production masterpiece. If you don't work in tv or film you'll never know what it takes to create a movie like this one. So many moving pieces that have to line up just perfectly... and boy do they line up in this one!If you haven't seen it yet - lucky you! You're in for a real treat. Enjoy!!","

"ironhorse_iv","12 January 2018","Ladies and Gentlemen and Children of All Ages! 'The Greatest Showman' has arrived. Directed by Michael Gracey, the film showcase, the visionary of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) who rose from nothing to create one of the greatest shows on Earth. Without spoiling the movie, too much, much like the real-life, promoter, this movie is here to entertains, and it completely succeeds in doing so. Nevertheless, it came without a few criticism from groups whom felt outrage & revulsion for what they deem as somewhat offensive overly exploitative of the physical impaired. Much like 1932's 'Freaks', a similar film before this, they're overlooking the positive incentives on showing people with impairments. Stories with characters with physical difficulties can help build understanding, compassion, and tolerance among viewers who don't face those challenges -- as well as give those who do a chance to see relatable people on screen. As a man of many physical challenges, I champion this portrayal, even if some of the disabled characters are played by able-bodied performers like Keala Settle, as the bearded lady, Lettie Lutz. As for the film portrayal of race. I also welcome the mostly positive portrayal of it, even if parts of it can be seemed as scientific racism, due to the fact that color of the skin, was group as an 'oddity', by Barnum's way of showmanship. Nevertheless, it's not as offensive as it could had been. After all, the film doesn't bring up, the fact that the real-life, Barnum bought slaves for blackface minstrel show, despite possessed, many anti-slavery convictions. Nevertheless, some of the artistic liberties about him, in this film, is still, a bit jarring, such as not, portraying any of his significantly involvement in politics, leading up to the American Civil War. It would had made, the reasons, why some people want to burn his museum, more convincing than the surface-level negative public attitudes about the theater as ""dens of evil'. While, I would had wish the movie was a little more open in exploring, more of the complexity social issues of the time. I didn't mind, for the most part, the film playing it safe with a water down version to make it more family-friendly. After all, it's supposed to be, musical escapism, not a historic accuracy biography film. However, there are two things, I didn't like about this portrayal of history. One is the villainess disservice to Swedish singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) by painting her as the evil jilted lover of Barnum. In real-life, they broke up, not due to a botch romantic relationship, but over marketing. Nothing really sinister. Secondary, Barnum's company nearly went out of business, due to bad property investments, not Lind's tour. In truth, Lind made Barnum, a lot amount of cash. The other thing, I didn't like about this movie was the idea, it was saying that Barnum invented the modern circus, which is highly misleading. In fact, the first modern circus was introduce to the public, 100 years earlier, by performer Philip Astley in 1770 & the first circus tent was introduce in 1838 by Thomas Cooke. Barnum didn't really start his show business until much later, after his lottery business went under. Honestly, it wasn't until his most well-known partnership with James A. Bailey that his museum show started to look like, 'the Greatest Show on Earth' of today. Despite that, the high-energy, upbeat, choreography dance & acrobatic action, throughout this movie very effectively evoke the ambiance of the circus's reckless, but daring persona, even it's not historical accuracy. While, the fake-looking CGI effects that went along with it, is kinda jolting to look at. It didn't really bother me, as much as it should had. Maybe, it's because all the musical numbers written by songwriters, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who also wrote the songs for the acclaim, 2016's musical, 'La La Land', were pretty memorable. No wonder, why the songs are winning awards. Catchy songs like 'This is Me', 'A Million Dreams', 'Never Enough' & others is the heart of this film. It had me, singing along in my seat. I don't care, if the music choice does not match the time period. They were catchy & enjoyable. As for singing. It's a mixed bag for me. Most of the singing from the cast was great; Ferguson as Lind, & Michelle Williams as Barnum's wife, Charity, were the only ones that were disappointing, as they had to be vocal-over. As for the acting, Jackman's performance, is a joy to watch, in spite of looking nothing like the real-life partially bald, promoter. As for supporting actors like Zac Efron; this is one of the few roles, I like him in, even if his character, Phillip Carlyle is highly fictional version of Bailey. Even, Zendaya was good in her role, as Anne Wheeler doing all of her own trapeze stunts. Yet, I just the film had more subtlety with the character's story between the musical numbers, a little more. The film does seem a bit rushed, with the focus going from one song and dance number to the next. It cause a lot of befuddling. Some confusing areas are with Barnum's career, grown. The film doesn't showcase enough. After all, some of Barnum's major attractions are either gloss over, left out or only hinted at, such as the infamous ""mermaid"". Even Barnum's relationship with the 'freaks' & the circus animals get very little screen-time. Perhaps in order, not to get the audience to dig too deep into the controversies of the circus' history. Nevertheless, their out of the blue, appearance, once in the while, were really perplexing at times. Another one that came out of nowhere, is the relationship subplot between co-owner, Carlyle & Wheeler. When did it started and how!? Nevertheless, things like that, could had been work better. Despite that, overall: while this crowd-pleasing movie a bit campy and hokey with old-timey surface-level sentiment at times. 'The Greatest Showman' is a show still worth watching. Highly recommended.","

"WalkdenEntertainment","10 January 2019","P.T Barnum became orphaned at a young age, left all alone in the world and poor. But that never stopped him from being creative and full of imagination, or a desire to become something memorable in the world.After marrying his childhood sweetheart and being a proud father of two daughters, Barnum (Hugh Jackson) loses his job and struggles once again to make ends meet. Barnum soon gets a creative spark and risks it all with the dream of becoming a Great Showman who presents the odd, the strange and the unique to the world.In case you're not aware, this film is a musical. Being a musical, this will normally scare away many movie goers as the film promises some singing and dancing. But, I'm happy to admit that The Greatest Showman is far more than just another musical film. This film had a great story and fantastic acting.Hugh Jackman (no surprise) is solid as the leading character, once again giving audience members chills and watery eyes from his performance alone. From the opening act it didn't take long for his character to become someone rather fun and likeable. Other acting performances from both Michelle Williams and Zac Efron were also well cast and provided outstanding supportive roles. Going into this movie, I never thought I would come out saying that one of my favorite musical numbers would be a number between Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.Another point of praise is the film's pacing. Let it be known on social media that I am not a major fan of musical films (more so when they are very sad musicals ...), but this is a musical film that is fast pace and well timed. Even during the Musical numbers, I never felt bored with the musical scene, nor did I ever roll my eyes and think 'oh man not another damn song'. Each song tells a story and that story moves quickly, full of excitement and without feeling dull or uninteresting. All the musical tracks of this movie are new and have many creative elements to them. Combining this with the film's great story, you have film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I enjoyed the film's positive message and I would easily recommend this film be viewed by many.It should have came as no surprise that this film's success has come heavily from another outstanding performance from Hugh Jackman. There is so much praise to be given to the many other cast members such as actress Michelle Williams. I also feel this was an excellent choice for the actor Zac Efron as he took a break from doing crude comedy films. Even if you're not a fan of musical films (like me), this is film that really shouldn't be missed. There is more to enjoy than just musical numbers here- this is film that carries amazing cinema elements and will leave you joyful.8.8/10

"carolrmag","21 March 2018","I love musicals and this movie is a handful of good characters, actors and songs. Can't really grasp were it when wrong. The story shares very good values for our society. It brings light and hope. But it failed to bring me along. I think it may have to do with too many characters worth exploring, and failing to explore deep enough the two main characters. Should it had been longer? Maybe that would have made it better. Or maybe cutdown some scenes that don't bring that much and take too long.","

"nicholls_les","25 October 2020","Awful movie so far from the truth. Barnum is portrayed as a likeable, skilled businessman with high morals. But in truth he was a conman and tyrant.
Hugh Jackman, has been wanting to make and star in this movie for years as an epic rags-to-riches romantic musical movie celebrating Barnum's extraordinary life.But the movie paints such a false picture of Barnum, it should be a comedy. There is no mention of Barnum's endless failed business ventures, or his hasty second marriage, after his first wife's death, to a girl 40 years his junior, or his horrific mistreatment of his human and animal exhibits?Tom Thumb (real name, Charles Sherwood Stratton), was someone who suffered from dwarfism and stood just 25in high. Barnum had him dressed him in military uniform and billed him as the 'world's smallest general'.But Barnum first used him when he was a five-year-old boy and he put him to work drinking alcohol as part of his act, he was barely seven when he started puffing on cigars.And what of Joice Heth, the 80-year-old black slave whom Barnum bought for in 1835, he had her rebranded as 'George Washington's 160-year-old nanny.' Poor Joice was blind and partially paralyzed, with just enough movement in her right arm to allow her to smoke a corn-cob pipe. She was also toothless. Barnum even boasted about how he'd plied her with drink and then pulled out her remaining teeth to make her look closer to 160. Not surprisingly, she didn't last long - barely a year. He made still more money out of her death, charging the public 50 cents each to attend her public autopsy.
She has been airbrushed out completely out of the movie.Also there is no mention in the film of black conjoined twins Millie-Christine, or black brothers, Eko and Iko, all of whom had been kidnapped from their parents as children for their 'freak show' value, and later acquired by Barnum. Or the dread-locked black men who were displayed in cages as 'wild men.'
Also upsetting was an African-American boy, William Henry Johnson, who suffered from microcephaly, which meant he had a tiny, sloping head.
His 'act' involved sitting in a cage, dressed in a furry suit, shrieking and rattling the bars and pretending to be the Wildman of Africa or a 'man monkey'. At other times he was exhibited as Zip the Pinhead.Barnum is shown heroically rescuing someone from a fire. In truth in the 1860s, his New York Museum did burn down not once, but twice, boiling whales alive, roasting pythons and letting orangutans and serpents loose to roam free in Manhattan.In what was perhaps his biggest fraud of all, Barnum achieved the acceptance he craved from posh society by reinventing himself as a philanthropist, reforming mayor and anti-slavery campaigner.What is annoying about these movies is that they try to history so that characters like Joice Heth on whom he built his fortune, the black brothers, Eko and Iko, poor little Zip the Pinhead and scores of others like them, are forgotten. Just as they have been in the film.","

"kebakent","17 June 2018","The music lacked variation, was obnoxiously cheerful, and the lyrics mainly consisted of the typical ""reach for the stars"" nonsense, one has come to expect from modern musicals. Although the base story had nothing to do with diversity and racism, these Hollywood pawns somehow managed to shovel it in there anyway. I did not appreciate the negative portrayal of white people, and men in particular. 
Interestingly, they somehow managed to ignore the fact that this particular white man exploited ""freaks"" for profit. The critics were absolutely right on this one. Talented actors could not save this dumpsterfire of a production. I regret wasting my time, and I am saddened that so many users have such poor taste.","

"tlarsen-54559","12 May 2018","Maybe if I didn't have almost everyone I know tell me to watch this it would've been better. But rewatch it? Some people over 5 times is borderline insanity. The story is poorly written, the sync between the over produced singing and at times laughable mouthing, and the terrible cgi all took me out of the feeling multiple times. I did appreciate how much they showed how selfish the main guy was, but there was no sense of him involved with the troup of freaks for more than just money. At times they tried to imply but they really were just a side character that he also happened to exploit. Also, what circus only has dancing and singing? This was definitely forgettable and I can't believe how many people told me to watch it. There is so much better cinema out there people! Most Disney movies are better than this.","

I appreciate that this movie feels like a carefully planned artwork of image, song and dance choreography, and that it dares to be little theatrical. Storywise it's admittedly a bit flimsy, but still fun to watch. Would have been even better if I felt more drawn into the story and if that second song (with the young boy singing) wasn't so cringe worthy. The effects where the movie had a theatre-like vibe made this movie especially fun to watch, just wish they added that even more consistently throughout. All and all fun for movie/musical fanatics, and probably not so much if you dislike cheesy song and dance.","

"leonblackwood","14 May 2018","Review:
Just like the remake of the Great Gatsby, the music in this movie really doesn't suit the time period, which is set during the late 1800's but they are catchy tunes. Personally the music did get on my nerves after a while, because I just wanted them to get on with the story but it is a musical so I should have known what I was getting myself into. Anyway at the beginning of the movie, you see a young, penniless Phineas Taylor Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who has a wild imagination and sadly loses his father at an early age. Whilst living with is foster parents, he falls in love with his childhood sweetheart, even though her father thinks that he is not right for her but after writing many letters to each other, they end up getting married. At an older age, he ends up in a dead end job, and when he gets laid off, he decides to open a wax museum to make ends meet. Due to bad ticket sales from the museum, he changes the attraction to a circus, with ""never seen before"" live acts, full of a collection of oddities and music. After a while, Barnum gambles everything on a opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson), which takes him away from the family home and puts a strain on his family life. Jenny expects more from there relationship, which Barnum declines and soon realises that he misses his family. On Jenny's last performance, she is pictured giving Barnum a kiss, which gets in the papers and makes his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) leave him, even though it was an innocent kiss. Meanwhile, his circus gets burnt down by the locals who think that it's a travelling freak show, so his partner, Phillip Carlyle agrees to help him to build the circus again, even though they don't have any money. Barnum then concentrates on sorting out his family life, and once that's back on track, he gathers the troops and they put on the best performance of there lives. It's quite a touching story which does have some emotional moments but I really couldn't take the singing. The costumes and the cinematography did make it unique and pretty spectacular but there wasn't much depth to the various characters, who all had strange oddities. I appreciate the amount of work that went into making the final product, and the fact that it had taken nearly 10 years to make but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm sure there are many people who will disagree with my point of view, especially after seeing the amount of money that it made at the box office but I've never been a big lover of musicals, so let's just put it down to personal choice. Average!Round-Up:
This is the first movie directed by Michael Gracey but he has made music videos for Natasha Bedingfield, the Sugababes and Will Young. For his first movie, he really took on a big task, and judging by the reviews, he certainly done a good job. With movies like The Muppet Man, Daughter of Smoke and Bone and Naruto in development, I'm sure that people will be anxious to see what he will be coming up with next but I personally doubt that he will smash the box office like he did with this movie. Although this wasn't my type of film, all of the actors put in a top performance, especially as most of them sung the numbers themselves. I can't see them making a sequel but I'm sure this film will be remembered for some time, especially as the soundtrack has become a best seller.Budget: $84million

The music, the choreography, the dancing was all amazing. It makes LA-LA-Land look like a B-movie. This reminds me of Moulin Rouge, which we over and over for the music and dancing.If you like original movies, not never ending remakes, go see this movie. It is amazing. I promise you wont be disappointed.","

"view_and_review","15 January 2018","All I knew going into this movie is that it was about P.T. Barnum. I had know idea it was a musical and that almost killed it for me. It wasn't even on my radar as far as movies to watch in the theater but hey I have MoviePass and this movie was showing. Although it was a musical and I'm not a fan of musicals there were some good tunes in there. Of course the majority of the songs ran eight minutes long (seemingly) but the singing was good and the tunes were catchy. They were very modern for a movie about the 19th century but I was willing to forgive that inconsistency. The story was a feel-good, beautiful, heart-warming story--I mean all that good stuff. This is not me being sarcastic or facetious, it had a very good message and theme. But I'm calling BS. I'm not calling BS on all of it, just certain aspects of it. P.T. Barnum was probably an imaginative visionary that saw a way of entertaining and making money by showing the odd and freakish. What I don't believe are those that were in the P.T. Barnum circus. America has a dark past that involves the criminal mistreatment of certain people, and I don't mean bearded ladies, small people and siamese twins. A certain race of people were wholly enslaved and ostracized, yet in the mid 1800's P.T. Barnum had mostly African-Americans in his shows?? Get real.And I don't know much about P.T. Barnum but my guess would be that he was out to line his own pockets first, second and last and whatever it took to do that he would do. Did he bring some joy to the world? Probably. I still doubt that he had one joyous jubilant staff that couldn't wait to show off their oddities. The movie was too harmonious and sanctified to be about real events. Such a movie in and of itself is excellent, just don't revolve it around real people and real events.","

"jonathancruano","28 December 2017","I decided for a lark to pick a movie at random with my buddy Chijindu and we decided to go see ""The Greatest Showman."" What a mistake!""The Greatest Showman"" was obviously intended as wholesome entertainment, but that only makes it a well-intended mess. The main problem with the film is that hardly any imagination went into creating a good story. The film largely replaces plot, dialogue, and character development with wall-to-wall special effects and loud and yet forgettable songs. Moreover, I can understand why the studio heads decided to jam in as many special effects and jarring songs into this picture as possible: the screenplay was rubbish and borrowed shamelessly from the plot formulas of a dozen other films. The scene where P.T. Barnum as a boy meets Charity comes straight out of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, which covers the subject of young love far more competently. Then midway through the movie, me and Chijindu called out the three plot formulas that determined the course of the rest of the film:(1) The cliche of whether P.T. Barnum was going to embrace the snobbish aristocrats or stay true to the circus performers who made him famous.(2) The conflict between an interracial romance and society's prejudices.(3) The love triangle involving P.T. Barnum, an opera singer, and his wife. As a result, this movie amounted to three half-baked plot formulas that were covered more capably in other movies. The screenplay also represents missed opportunities to explore some truly interesting areas. For instance, I would like to learn something about how P.T. Barnum and Phillip Carlyle ran their circus and managed costs. And maybe P.T. Barnum's circus could have gone on a number of extraordinary adventures all over the United States. But alas no, this film did not want to take advantage of any of these opportunities even though its ambitious budget certainly could have afforded it. The other problem with this movie is that while bigotry is one of its central themes, it is not handled in an intelligent and honest way. One of the film's unexplained conceits is that P.T. Barnum and Phillip Carlyle are virtually immune from any of the prejudices of their time and can see their world through 21st century eyes. By depicting Barnum and Carlyle in this post-modern light, the studio heads avoid the difficulties of explaining how these two characters dealt with the internal conflict between their prejudices and being exposed to the humanity of the circus performers. To be sure, these reservations about the plot might not have weighed as heavily as they did if the wall-to-wall songs were any good. Unfortunately, the songs in ""The Greatest Showman"" do not belong to the tradition of great musicals. In Disney's ""Little Mermaid,"" there was close collaboration between the people who wrote the lyrics and the people who set those lyrics to music. As a result, we still fondly remember Little Mermaid's songs like ""Under the Sea."" But no such collaboration took place here. Instead, what appears to have happened was that truly horrible lyrics were written and the composer had the thankless job of trying and failing miserably to set these lyrics to music. These songs are memorable only for how loud and embarrassing they are and I challenge anyone to be able to remember the tune to any of these songs -- and I bet they could not do it. As a result, ""The Greatest Showman"" is a film with good character actors trapped in formulaic plot with terrible musical numbers. There are some brief moments of wonder, including some rare quiet moments where P.T. Barnum and Charity are talking with their daughters Helen and Caroline. But unfortunately those moments are completely overwhelmed by the awful musical numbers (which were clearly prerecorded and then lip synched on screen) and the absence of a great storyline. ""The Great Showman,"" in a phrase, is anything but a great show.","

"CinePendejo","20 December 2017","Even after seeing the overblown mess that is THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, I still can't believe they bother to make this. Dawning the promotional tagline ""from the same lyricists of LA LA LAND"", this years hot new musical feels slap-dashed, scrambled, and razzle-dazzled together in order to cynically profit off its success with embarrassing results. It's the type of year-end crowd-pleaser that talks your ear out about following your dreams and forget the haters, yet is also so obnoxiously over-the-top yet thoroughly forgettable it almost tunes itself out. It's like if HAMILTON was remade for the Disney Channel.It stars Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum as he goes through the ""Started From The Bottom"" routine and turn from a poor apprentice into the worlds most famous entertainers. He falls in love with Charity to her fathers disapproval, but prevails because true love. He then gets stuck in a low-end job that gets bankrupt, to which he gets inspired to create a museum full of larger-than-life characters. He then gets the extra endorsement from Zac Efron as a playwright who falls in love with one of the performers played by Zendaya. Then he suddenly gets bitter after a dispute with his troupe and his wife after he discovers that he wants more, which suddenly leads to big consequences. Then they get back together through a sing and dance number. Jumping Jesus, that's a lot of story. The whole thing has too much both onscreen and on paper that it suddenly became nauseating. Penned by Bill Condon in his second forgettable musical this year, it has the usual crap pacing, wasted opportunities, at least half a dozen arcs and cliches, and subplots left on the cutting room floor. It constantly blows over predictable storybeats through break-neck speed that you start to wonder what the fuck is going on. On top of that, commercial director Michael Gracey adds a whole bunch of calculated splendor - even in scenes where they're just talking - to this garbage screenplay in order to fool you into its supposed majesty. To me, I just got tuned out after the third time they sing.Speaking of things overproduced, I've never heard anything so needlessly bombastic as that soundtrack. Along with the aforementioned visual eye rape, each music number sounds like it really thinks the movie is some transporting adventure. It really just sounds like they took that opening song from HAMILTON and copied the same swooning violin and blaring percussion in every goddamn song. Even in scenes where it calls for a moody, somber treatment instead feels like we're fighting in the Battle in Narnia. I just wanted to tell these guys to dial it the fuck down. And then there's Barnum himself. It's admittedly nice to see Jackman shine in a happier role after LOGAN, but this is just a thinly written character. Glossing over the more nitty-gritty aspects of the historical figure, Barnum trudges along the same familiar beats of first being a starry-eyed optimistic to flat-out dickhead in the end. Even the shambling script leaves him no real footing to his arcs, leaving Jackman all dewey-eyed through numerous pitfalls and successes that mean nothing.If the film offered me a glimmer of hope, it's when we're introduced to the ""acts"" themselves. Even at first seems exploitative to their appearances, these larger-than-life misfits look like they're packed with hidden stories and aspirations of their own. During one scene in which they sing in defiance against their oppressors, I almost leaped with joy... until it suddenly cuts to the same damn music template, in which I felt pissed again. For a movie about finding humanity in unusual places and finding your place, it's saddening to see these characters pushed aside for butthole Barnum and his stupid white people problems. I'd rather watch these guys again.A common criticism about last years rapturous LA LA LAND was that it was all glam but no depth. Even if I'd agree that most people - like me admittedly - overrate this movie to kingdom come, there's a certain charm, effort, and specificity to LA LA LAND that made it sing more clearly than this movie ever can. Imagine if LA LA LAND was like a smooth, adventurous melody while SHOWMAN was like what if your 5-year-old son fumbles with your keyboard set.Like any crummy movie, though, it tries to excuse itself by being for the fans and not the dreary critics. In one scene, a critic meets Barnum and states that the show is little more than smoke and mirrors, to which Jackman remarks by highlighting how much smiles he makes by the audience. As glib as that sounds, I couldn't help but agree. In many ways, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is like the latest pop music that the current generation won't shut up over; its loud, repetitive, incomprehensible, and packed with a heavy-handed message to make you think it's more important that it really is.  But hey! Give it a month, and you'll get tired of it and forget it even exists.","

"TxMike","22 April 2018","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The music, the choreography, the singing, the story, all in all one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. It isn't a documentary, it is a musical inspired by P.T. Barnum's early life and start as great showman.It is strange that many of us first encountered Hugh Jackman, the actor, as Wolverine. That got him known but in fact he is one of the best modern song-and-dance performers. In fact when he was host of a TV awards program a few years back, in recognition of his ""great showmanship"" the idea of a ""Greatest Showman"" movie musical with him playing thre lead role was conceived.Most of the story here takes place in the mid 1800s as P.T. Barnum (Jackman), a natural showman, first developed his Manhattan museum of oddities, then eventually ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" with his circus.Michelle Williams plays his wife Charity Barnum and to my pleasant surprise she is an excellent singer. The only major character that did not do her own singing was Rebecca Ferguson as the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind.Lots of good performances, too many to mention in a brief review, but for anyone who enjoys a good musical this one is a real winner. I plan to watch it again before I return the DVD.January 2019: I watched it a second time on BluRay, I came away with an even better impression. Plus the ""extras"" on how this movie came to be and how the songs were written are among the best I have seen for any movie.","

"cfaehl-72556","31 December 2017","I love musicals, and went to The Greatest Showman on the strong recommendation of my girlfriend, who'd seen it and loved every bit of it. She was shocked that my reaction was so negative. The sins of this movie are numerous, but to begin with, as a musical, you have to consider the music above all else. If you like generic, bland, pop mixes, you'll probably like the music in this. If on the other hand, you like thematically appropriate, well-timed, plot-based, interesting compositions like those in Chicago or Moulin Rouge, give this a pass. Choreography was similarly uninspiring, from opening scene to closing credits. Literally not a single memorable number. Character development: there is none. Prepare for the most cursory archetypes that aren't explored or developed in any real way. In no way did I ever care about a single character in this film.Overall direction: I'm sorry, but this was godawful. People do not SMILE like this all the time. They don't LAUGH at pedestrian dialogue. Whenever the pacing seemed to grind to a halt, hey, why not liven it up with a song? Truly painful. Even from a technical perspective, this one flopped: costumes were lackluster, makeup was shockingly uneven (you could see the glue lines of the bearded woman), CGI (thankfully sparse) was flat and not composited very well (eg, most shots with elephants). Early on, it seemed as though the filmmaker was shooting for a Moulin Rouge-style fantasy world. That didn't succeed, and then was dropped abruptly for more conventional presentation.Do I sound angry? Well, I am; I was prepared to love this movie. I wanted to love this movie. My girlfriend and I discussed for hours afterwards, as it seriously affected her - several scenes caused her to tear up, she loved the music and dance, she thought Hugh Jackman was fabulous. I was flabbergasted, as I was merely trying to get to the end so I could escape and do something more entertaining. We're not often on such different pages, but wow, was this one polarizing.","

"tanne-35639","26 December 2017","I just made an IMDB account in order to write this review. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The last time I watched a movie I was this excited about was Batman: Dark Knight (mind you, a very different movie) and it feels great to be so excited. Off the bat this movie has a stunning cast and soundtrack. The acting is great and the singing is better. There wasn't a single song in the entire movie that I didn't find myself truly enjoying listening to and I am really excited to listen to the soundtrack again and again in the future. These songs should all be classics! The casting was perfect (even Zac Efron fit his role perfectly).This was a fun, emotional, and exciting rollercoaster of a movie and I left the theater wanting much much more of this movie. 10/10 would recommend to anyone. My wife and I couldn't be more excited about this movie. Also, it reminded us both of the animated film Sing: lot's of interesting parallels.","

"flcntk3-856-986017","22 December 2017","The Greatest Showman is a celebrative film about P. T. Barnum's knack of showmanship and his relentless drive as an opportunist and a businessman that started with the presentation of the out-of-ordinary as the extraordinary to his establishment of the spectacular spectacles of the Big Top circus. Along the way, as a side line to the story he tackles and crosses the boundary of social and cultural snobbery with himself becoming victimized for a brief moment in his chase to social climbing. The film comes as an upbeat musical that never dwells too deeply into the sociology of class distinction and the acceptance of society's outcasts by the norm. Instead it brings together in my mind the best evocation of ""Moulin Rouge"" in terms of its music which is footstompingly good. The music is boisterous, melodic, assertive and full of life that makes you want to stand up and join the dancing chorus on screen. The other thing it evokes is cirque du soleil. This association is more personal because they both excites me with imagination and beyond of what an ordinary circus is about.","

"artdonovandesign","23 January 2021","From the very outset, I should have known what I was in for.The movie begins with a pounding, stomping, stadium-chant, done in ""We Will Rock You""-esque fashion.And this chant doesn't stop. Over and over and over and over and over....and OVER until I wanted to claw my eyes out! And certainly would have if it were not for the fact that I actually rented it on Amazon for a $2.00. discount. Thank goodness I got it in SD and not springing for HD. But it's my own fault. I should have read the critic's reviews beforehand. Mea Culpa.But back to the agony. True to form, this film delivered on every emotionally-manipulative, late 2000's trope I expected-and with that darn, soppy, mind melting song to match. A song the producers were darn sure would work it's way into our National conscience like, ""My Heart Will Go On"" ( which is a heck of a great tune and performance!)In short, if you blubber in proud, heartfelt, joyful tears to shows like ""The Voice"" and ""American Idol"", this movie will have you cheering, as it's a modern interpretation of old-time movies. But that comparison isn't quite fair. Those movies had a genuine character to them. There was an honesty in many of those homespun tales. It was hard to be cynical about them because they spoke of genuine shared values- no matter how dated they might seem by today's standards.But here, I simply found the whole thing unbearable. And now to wash this commercial shmaltz out of my mind, I'm going to watch, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" a few more, blessed times.","

Hugh Jackman is clearly having fun, the show values, choreographies and unique songs convince throughout. It was a great atmosphere in the cinema hall, the people clapped along, danced along. In other circumstances, or if I had a duty to anyone to be objective, I might have given fewer stars, but for such a great cinematic experience that I had in this film, I can turn a blind eye.","

Now that I've seen the film and heard all the songs, I can say I love it!!The film started beautifully and set up the P.T Barnum's life story in such a wonderful and magical way, even if it was different from real life (a problem with some people) it was still honest to being a human and being a human who is different from others. I really loved this film and its execution.","

"AlsExGal","8 October 2018","I thought this was an incredible movie, so I was also curious about the overload of criticism. I understand viewers having frustrations about the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie. I knew nothing about PT Barnum's life when I saw this, so I was able to enjoy it as an independent creative piece--which, to me, is what it was meant to be.In and of itself, the movie was altogether captivating from the filming aesthetic, to the music, to the creative dialogue, to the storyline. I finished the film feeling inspired and motivated. It hit the nail on the head, for me, to motivate adults and children's' imagination--reminding humanity of what's most important: love, hope, family, friends, spreading joy, fighting for what you believe in amidst criticism, etc. It shines a light on flawed societal standards of happiness (the American dream) by using unexpected people, methods, and situations to open others' minds, and break them away from fixed, mainstream thinking patterns of materialistic success. Its message sparks excitement and enthusiasm, especially towards those of us who feel inadequate, or ""in the shadows"". It's a motivating and inspiring breath of fresh air.I would hope that all movie makers' of this genre have the goal is to create a story/artwork that invigorates a similar kind of audience response to the one that I had to The Greatest Showman. If I were looking for a biographical movie, expecting a completely accurate historical recounting, I'd go see a documentary.","

"The_Dman313","14 January 2018","From the beginning, cinema has always been about the magic of entertainment. Telling living stories, they are able portray events, moments, people, and show so many things that can never be seen anywhere else. This in essence was everything P.T. Barnum could have wished for.Now, I'm writing this review mainly do to the recent divisiveness this movie created among critics (Look no further than the 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) with the main critique among them all being the portrayal of the main character himself P.T. Barnum. They claim the showman to be a watered down version of the real Barnum and say even more so that the film glosses over much of the real life events that show him to be a much more complicated figure, than seen in the movie. Now this is a fair critique, character is portrayal is one of the key aspects when making a biographical picture, but in this case I think a more cheerful watered down version may have benefited it. Now I hate to sound condensing, knowing that I am not a professional critic myself, but I feel many of whom have missed the point. Barnum would not have wanted a serious, 60 year old, dialogue heavy portrayal of himself, if anything he would have loved Hugh Jackman's performance. He's excitable, happy, energetic and just like his ideas you could even call him magical. Same with the rest of the characters (Many of whom did not exist in real life) like the Anne Wheeler, the trapeze artist played by Zendaya, who has to deal with racism along with bigotry do to a romance. She too is in love with performance and has the same magical quality to her. Characters like these capture the scope of Barnum's ideas along with the imagination. If portraying real life versions of some the characters the movie (As Barnum would have hated) would have become grounded in realism taking away much of the wonder that Barnum thought was necessary for entertainment. 
The movie also goes for a stylistic choreographed style seen in many musicals. This style is especially apparent during the musical numbers, full of lights, stunts dancing and complex camera movement. The movie looks great during these scenes and even when there isn't music or dancing it's still present by having great set design and mesmerizing colors. Everybody behind the scenes must have worked incredibly hard and it it really shows. This is movie reliant on these set pieces in which it definitely holds up. There is a part in the movie where someone tries to convince him that drama/plays are a definitive form of entertainment, in which (From what I remember) Barnum says something along the lines of ""Who would want to watch people talk for 2 hours"". Views such of these from Barnum is why I believe the filmmakers decided to make the movie such a flashy, cinematic, musical instead of a drama it could have easily been. This I believe captures what his shows meant and exactly the way Barnum would have wanted a adaptation such as this to be.In conclusion, this movie did a great a great job capturing Barnum, not in sense of character, but more of sense of spirit and gives a grand cinematic retelling of his life. The movie is not perfect, it can be cliche at time and it's fast pacing can seem a bit sudden many times. However, this movie entertained me and memorized me many time and I would recommend a viewing (Especially while it still is in theaters). But be warned if you don't like musicals I doubt you'll like this.","

PT Barnum was responsible for COUNTLESS intentional & horrific deaths to circus animals starting from his circus's inception.
This film also gives saint-like motivations to PT Barnum for his using conjoined humans and animals and other ""oddities"" for financial gain.
Just google it to see for yourself as there are many, many reputable articles from the last few days telling the truth about this opportunistic man.
It's all very sad that Mr. Jackman didn't think this through because the cast and crew are obviously very talented and turn in some fantastic performances.","

The acting is ham, the dialogue is austere, the Auto-Tuned singing impressions of Beyoncé are irritating & the characters, settings, & story are all so contrived.The music itself is so generic, predictable, basic & regurgitated. A good musical has a song to fit every mood. Loss, Sorrow, Wonder, Yearning, Love, Betrayal, Introspection, Rebellion, Triumphant, etc. But every number has to start slow & end in a big cluttered Bill Board Crescendo of ""Happy Happy Jo Joy"". The way everyone relies on portamento.. gliding from note to note in order to avoid landing on correct notes is distracting & run of the mill.Their structures are conventional, as are the 4 chords they tend to use over & over.. just like pop music. All in simple time.The shaky cam, frenetic editing, & acrobatic cinematography deliberately divests us of witnessing any choreography. The CGI backdrops & other random assets shows where they glued the scenes together in their spare time on Sunday afternoons. And as for the sound? Everyone sings mute; obviously, as the pitch-corrected & over-compressed Mic-crisp breaths never sound real. But what is real in this god awful film?Maybe everything & everyone are just CGI props, polygons, with platitudes of one over-privileged prig in the film itself? And it created itself? After all, it is hard to believe that any human could create such a dire monstrosity. Unless it's a Hollywood feature of course.Utterly forgettable. Only the mindless shall think it is good.","

"mukava991","4 February 2018","The creators of ""The Greatest Showman"" meant well - to give us an uplifting film about inclusiveness, loyalty, true love, high principles, spreading happiness and making dreams come true. They chose to flesh out these notions by distilling the multifaceted life of P.T. Barnum into a 105-minute musical, sort of an ""essence of Barnum"" or, as it turns out, ""Barnum Syrup."" Sometimes their abridgments work splendidly as cinema, as in the early song-and-dance sequence that takes us from Barnum's childhood in rags to shipping clerk in business suit. At other times they asphyxiate us with musically inert anthems of victimhood or declarations of pride. Not one song is memorable. Some are okay while they're being sung, helped by swooping camera movement, acrobatic choreography and some excellent vocals, but you won't be humming them on the way home. Some are cringe-inducing, particularly the weirdly misconceived presentation of the famous Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, whom Barnum famously made even more famous by bringing her to America. For one thing, she is played by Rebecca Ferguson who despite being half Swedish speaks with a British accent even though the script clearly points out that she is Swedish. For another thing, the song she sings to an enraptured crowd of New York society swells is dreary, monotonous early 21st-century power-pop. If you're going to ignore historical context, even musically (as did the execrable ""Moulin Rouge"" in 2001), at least give the audience some indication of Lind's actual appeal (a vocal purity, as legend has it, but definitely not belting and other pyrotechnics). Regarding historical context, it goes without saying that the scenario ignores every 19th century reality except, to some degree, sets, costumes and of course the social and racial prejudices of the time, but only to score identity politics points. Of course, with writers like Jenny Bicks (very much at home in the 1990's world of ""Sex and the City"") and Bill Condon (whose uneven depiction of James Whale in ""Gods and Monsters"" was made bearable by Ian MacKellan's inspired acting and whose ""Kinsey"" was a bore) you're not going to get much of a feel for past eras.The score by the ""La La Land"" team of Justin Paul and Benj Pasek is almost entirely forgettable. The previous film had one catchy tune (""City of Stars""). The music here is boilerplate, the lyrics only very occasionally above banal (if you can hear them; most of the songs begin clearly and softly and intimately but quickly expand into heavily orchestrated extravaganzas which mask the paltry musical and lyrical substance).As for casting, you can hardly miss with the charismatic and multi-talented Hugh Jackman. Michelle Williams as his wife is largely wasted and gets stuck with some of the most embarrassingly obvious dialogue. Zac Ephron, who seems to be thickening in his middle age, plays an invented character, a high-society playwright who is miserable and empty until he teams up with Barnum, exchanges the pen for the emcee's baton and falls in love with an African-American trapeze artist (Zendaya).The film is reminiscent of some of the low-budget, episodic but energetic biopics that rolled off the Hollywood assembly line in the 1930s except here the spending is lavish and the song-and-dance sequences, which at their best advance the narrative rather than overstate the obvious, are eye-poppingly elaborate. There seems to be a deliberate attempt to recapture the sentimentalism and syrupiness that was commonplace in many old-time movies, but mixed with the 21st century mindset of the writers and director, it becomes self-parody.The main message seems to be the old reliable one: love is the most important thing of all, even more important than material success and it's better to put love first, and that we all, no matter what we look like or where we come from, are valuable individuals worthy of respect.","

This movie is ahead of it's time, made with passion and every part of it is nothing less than perfection. It pushes the ideology that if you want your dream to come true, then do anything that you can for your dreams and goals even if it means going against the society or your own relatives or parents. Because you have this one life and it's your responsibility to give it a meaning that would make this life worth living for you. Don't be afraid to disappoint people, cause in the end, if you succeed then nothing else would matter.
It should get Atleast 9 stars so it gets viewed by future generations and this will fill them with hope and guts to build their own world that they dream of. I would recommend this movie to youth cause while REALISM might break your hope, optimism and faith in yourself will always give you strength to fight for what you want for yourself.

The story has a few plot lines that keep it going but it all feels very surface level? As in the main plot never really took off. It wasn't building towards a climax, it's just events that follow each other but in a film that wasn't slice of life. The characters were also ok. It could have been spectacular, but for me it missed the mark.IMO they needed a better composer, less subtly with the plots (i mean, it's a CIRCUS! Give PT more PERSONALITY. He's a New York Businessman with a dream and determination (and had controversies with workers). You have the stories of the performers too- everyone in NYC (to this day) has a story of where they came from where they're going but they made it so....bland (to me).The positives: cinematography and camera work was really good. The way they planned the camera angles or whatnot was excellent. The sets were great (except the CGI animals- seemed hokey to me). The acting was...okay. The characters were...mediocre. The pacing was okay. The music was okay. It honestly made me want to watch a documentary of the fellow cuz he's an interesting person and this film alluded to that (inaccurately) and didn't make it their own.

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","30 December 2017","Well it took nearly til the end of the year for it to happen but I found my least favourite movie of 2017. The name of this horrendous garbage dump? The Greatest Showman. Now, I like musicals so of course I was intrigued to see this. And yet, I cringed every time someone opened their mouths to sing. Its like this movie wanted so hard to be seen as an inspirational tale. Every song shoves this down your throat. I get it movie...we're all special...be who you're meant to be...blah blah blah move on. Now, its by the same guys who did La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen, so I know they can write other stuff. Also, having every song as a pop song felt kind of distracting. But for the most part I could get somewhat past that choice of music....up until the Opera singer showed up. This would have been the point to show an ACTUAL operatic song. But no......another pop ballad. And Rebecca Ferguson, is not a bad singer by any means...but I wasnt exactly wowed by her voice and yet shes being marketed in this movie as like ""the best opera singer in the world"". Like mmmkay...if you're at least going to go down the pop route Im sure there would have been better choices to make. Someone like Adele, maybe? It also felt very paint by numbers...very safe. I mean, they try to make a point about racism in this movie...and they dont even have the balls to truly explore that. The romance between Zendaya and Zac Efron's characters felt forced. They didnt have any chemistry with each other. I have some other small nitpicks....but boy oh boy....for a movie that kept talking about bringing joy to the audience I sure wasn't feeling it. If I had to say something positive, the costumes are beautiful. And I think the actors were fine. I think PT Barnum is an interesting person to make a movie about, just not in this movie. I think it would have worked slightly better if they hadnt tried to make it a musical.","

"Offworld_Colony","7 February 2020","Excellent scenes and sets and costumes strung together with lies and boring cliche nonsense.A couple of nice moments try and alter the generic material, but the end result is the same, the same broad beats you always get in one of these feel-good poppy modern musicals.The music is excellent and the lyrics are solid and memorable, it's just all in service of a complete lie about the fraudulent PT Barnum and the utterly rote story; I mean there's literally a song called From Now On where Barnum agrees to change his ways in the most cloying and obvious and awkward way, at least other films have the good sense to make the third act turn a little more subtle.","

The songs are lazy, generic, and some just very unoriginal. Now I'm glad the movie wasn't longer than it was but weirdly enough it just feels like a constant rush to get to the next song with 0 priority to the actual story and characters, which when you get to them they're not special. The performances were far from spectacular from the rush to get to the next song there's no time to care about the characters. It's just a bloated waste of a movie there's a chance this could've been better as a normal non-musical movie","

"2001ASOfan","21 December 2017","Just got home from seeing an opening night showing of ""The Greatest Showman,"" perfectly presented on a big, bright, sharply-focused CinemaScope-masked screen with a great sound system, and this is one of those breathtaking films that uses every wide-screen inch in a glorious way, for the full running time of the film. I've not been this completely, instantly smitten with a film musical since Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" all those years ago--it's that inventive and, thankfully, as exhilarating and as much, or maybe even more, fun (hmm...guess I'll have to go see it again this week just to see whether it is more fun than ""Rouge"" was--that will be my excuse for seeing this at least one more time while it's still on the big screen!). Frankly, I'd put ""Greatest Showman"" not only up there with ""Rouge""--it was also as fun, touching, and downright unabashedly sentimental (in a very good way) as my favorite musical of all time, ""Singin' in the Rain."" And I don't say that lightly. There is unrestrained, uplifting passion and joy in this film, and we as the audience are heartily invited to join in. It has been a long (long!) time since I have enjoyed every song in a new, original musical score on first listen, and the energy and sheer magic of how the choreography was filmed for this production will be a fascinating study all to itself. I actually involuntarily gasped a few times from the inventiveness of the camera work and just how well it captured the swirling, dizzying flow of the dancing--and I am very aware of just how difficult filming great choreography can be. One quick example: There is a song and dance number that takes place in a bar (featuring Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and one very nimble bartender) which had me holding my breath without realizing it until it was over, when I suddenly realized my mouth was hanging open and it was time for me to breathe again. While that was a highlight, it's genuinely just one of many. At film's end, my best friend and I broke into spontaneous applause, and we were thrilled to hear the audience around us doing the same. There will no doubt be some cranky, joyless critics who will hate it (which is actually an amusing subplot in the film itself), and those who don't like musicals because ""people just aren't supposed to break out into song in a movie"" will likely not be fans, either, but wow, for those of us that feel like there are way too few great musicals onscreen anymore, this is Heaven on Earth. I truly cannot wait to see it again. / UPDATE 12/23/17: Saw it again last night, only two days after my opening-day viewing, again with my best friend, and we both agreed it was even better the second time around. We noticed subtleties and touches we hadn't noticed in the first dazzling (and overwhelming) viewing, and are both now even more hooked on the soundtrack as well--I just bought it for that same best friend as a Christmas gift, along with a book about the making of the film. I truly am, well, unabashedly in love with this film, and will be seeing it yet again as soon as I can. What a perfect Holiday-time gift from the filmmakers and performers for musical fans and moviegoers!","

"NarniaIsAwesome","20 July 2018","I originally had no desire to see this film. I mean, Zac Efron flailing around in a circus? Not my cup of tea. But absolutely everyone I talked to that had seen it told me it was ""sensational!"" So, I tried it...One thing everyone agreed on was that it had amazing choreography. Let me tell you, Disney Channel films have better dance sequences! They try to create the illusion that the choreography is epic by hiding the truly simple dance moves behind elaborate set pieces and dozens of extras. The singing is also nothing special. The main problem is that although the film takes place in the 1800's, most of the musical numbers are worthy of recordings by Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber! That's part of the ""Magic of the Movies."" When a film is set in another time era, you get to be transported there and experience it. Also, Jenny Lind's catchy tune 'Never Enough' is masked as inspirational; it is actually about a spoiled brat that is basically never content.Another flaw is that pretty much nothing in the movie happened in real life. But, if you are going to make it unrealistic, you might as well give it a heartfelt story. The writers almost achieved this in the very beginning, creating a blossoming friendship/romance between P.T. and his future wife, Charity. But as soon as the circus came along, their relationship was practically forgotten and it was all about Zac Efron. The movie would have been better if it focused more on Barnum's family life and the circus was a side story.The only mildly talented cast member was Hugh Jackman, whose singing voice actually didn't make me want to scramble for earplugs, although my father kept asking when he would use his claws.So, if you're wanting to see a truly beautiful and moving musical, I recommend 2012's 'Les Miserables.' As far as 'The Greatest Showman' is concerned, spare your eardrums from Keala Settle.","

"questl-18592","18 August 2020","Feel like I should kick this off by saying I know next to nothing about the real P.T. Barnum. I've heard that the movie portrays him in a much kinder light than he deserves but I'm not a historian and frankly don't care enough to research so purely basing this review on the film and not on any historical (in)accuracy.Speaking of the movie, this was pretty underwhelming for me. During the film, Barnum's act is referred to as being without substance and I feel that holds true for the majority of the movie itself. Yeah, it hits the tropes and checks the boxes but it's too rare that it bares its soul. The two big songs that found radio play are both moving, touching pieces but aside from that there's just not much here.What may change on future viewing, should there be any, is the efficacy of the songs. Musicals are tricky. The music has to be good, very good, while the actors are often performing crazy dance numbers and not every actor is capable of that. Voice overs are fine, but this felt off to me the whole time. It was too polished, to pristine, it didn't track at all with what the actors were doing and that bugged me the whole time. Might not in the future, but it did here and a musical with poor sound work is going to fail, despite how good some elements may be.I was able to stream this and I think anyone curious should do the same. I can't say I give this a strong recommend but some people obviously like it so if you can stream it give it a shot, maybe even just as background noise.","

"blanche-2","6 October 2018","Hugh Jackman is one of the most charismatic performers in existence, and he proves it again as P.T. Barnum in ""The Greatest Showman."" The film also stars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson.The film is a 98 percent fictionalized story of the rise of P.T. Barnum. Barnum was a fascinating and somewhat controversial character. He was part of the government of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and made many improvements there. The film touches on few of his accomplishments, concentrating on his circus.I've heard the music described as having ""High School Musical"" type tunes. Were they awful? No. Pleasant and well-sung? Definitely. The film is a huge spectacle and intended to be seen on the big screen. The choreography is wonderful, too.My only gripe in this otherwise enjoyable film is that Jenny Lind sang pop songs. I realize that was done because it would have been too jarring with the other music in the film, but at the very least, she should have sung something in a soprano voice, even if it was Carry Me Back to Old Virginny. I've seen Hugh Jackman on stage three times - he's always sensational. Zac Efron sang and danced well and exhibits a new maturity.Anyone interested should read about the fascinating and varied accomplishments of P.T. Barnum. This is no biopic. But it is fun.","

"johnyskar","29 September 2018","I am not into musicals, it's not my favorite genre but i can find one enjoyable if it's not full singing and resembles a movie and not just theater.
The Greatest Showman is a combination of the two and it delivers exactly what it's supposed to. Entertainment. It entertains the audience in the movie and at the same time it entertains us.The birth of the world of Showmanship appears difficult with high risk but also high reward. The struggles of visionary and ambitious mister Barnum seem pretty realistic. He does everything he can and goes all in to fullfill his dreams 
against all obstacles allong the way. The enemies are there, and they come in the shape of Fame, Envy, and most importantly Acceptance. As most people he would fall into the trap of fame getting in his head but as soon as he learns his 
lesson he will get out a bigger man. The Circus will bring together all kinds of people for the audience's pleasure. Sure, money and fame are involved but it's larger than that. It's a new kind of show that would only continue to grow in 
the future. Jackman is passionate, Williams is emotional and Effron is cheerfull but also serious in a way we are not used to see him, without relying on his abs and obvious comedy. A great cast and total result in general by everyone involved, and a theme 
that pairs nicely with the music and singing.A nice and positive-mood-bringing watch. ✍8/10","

"llsbundy","26 December 2017","Critics these days, pssshhhh. It's the public reviews that seem to get things spot on. This movie was upbeat, fast moving (which I love) and completely dazzling. The talent was top notch and the story line was appealing to all ages. Sure this is a clean family film, but it doesn't make it any less artsy or enjoyable than those with an adult rating. I looked up the actual history of P.T. Barnum, and this movie wasn't far off from the basic story of his life. Sure they added drama to the story, but I don't even care. It's not like this was a pivotal story in World History. He was an entertainer, and guess what, a movie in his name just got made that was completely entertaining. I'm sure he'd be pleased with the end result. I am not one to see movies twice, but I'm sure I will. My husband and I went to the late showing last night and I will likely go again this week with my daughters and their friends. Is there anything Hugh Jackman can't do? Clearly there is not!! I would see this on the big screen with the full sound effects, and I'd probably plan on seeing it in theaters twice if I were you.","

"myriamlenys","17 November 2018","From a musical point of view, ""The greatest showman"" isn't very interesting : the music is bland and the lyrics are trite. Much of it looks and feels like a watered-down version of ""Moulin rouge"". Still, the various makers of the movie were clever enough to make Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, sing the same kind of forgettable stuff as the rest of the crowd, justly realizing that their work was unlikely to withstand a comparison with a nice slice of, say, Meyerbeer or Bellini.However, there are worse problems than the musical aspect. The movie is intent on delivering some of the most contradictory messages imaginable. Try this one : ""It is fully okay to look unusual - to be a giant, an albino, or half of a Siamese twin - on condition that you don't mind being stared at for ten hours a day"". In the contradiction stakes, this comes close to gems like ""We fully understand that you're a lesbian, we just want you to sleep with men"" or ""As the ruling king of a constitutional monarchy, you are uniquely qualified to spread the word about the benefits of communism"".Another message from ""The greatest showman"" : if you gather a group of people with unusual looks or medical problems, and if you put them on display for financial gain, you're not exploiting them, you're supporting them.Finally the movie warns you about the dangers of not wanting to go and see a freak show - chances are that you, annoying spoilsport, are an effete snob, a proto-Nazi or a knuckle-dragging primitive. You're not like that, are you ? So do the right thing ! Do what any decent, all-American, God-fearing citizen would do ! Go and gape at some inoffensive humans with a medical condition !A modest conclusion : people who teach subjects such as philosophy, ethics and logic would do well to give the movie a wide berth, lest they suffer a stroke.I'm still throwing the movie a few stars, because there are some likeable performances and fine stunts to enjoy. Hugh Jackman in particular imbues his P.T. Barnum with a great deal of charm - much more charm, I suspect, than the actual P.T. Barnum ever possessed...","

"sleemon","22 January 2018","I see about a hundred movies a year, and this is the first one I have walked out on in recent memory. Rather than ""magical"" I found the songs to be mediocre and so repetitive that I wanted to tear my hair out. Singing ""A million dreams is all it's gonna take"" over and over and over again is no substitute for a plot. I left the second time I saw the same collection of ""human oddities"" performing what seemed to be the exact same out-of-place modern song and dance routine for the second time in a circus ring, to the delight of an audience dressed in period costume, but rocking out like no 19th century audience ever had.It's not that I'm not totally averse to modern song and dance in a story that takes place in the 19th century. I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, a movie whose anachronistic music seemed jarring in 2001. But although that movie wasn't exactly ""Citizen Kane"", at least it had Nicole Kidman to look at. It may be that I know a bit too much about American history to let all the absurd inaccuracies past. Maybe the audience that loved this movie had no idea that Jenny Lind was an opera singer, not a contestant on ""The Voice."" Maybe they had no idea that she was a philanthropist who gave away the vast sums she earned to her favorite charities, not a hootchie momma homewrecker. Maybe they have no idea that Barnum lured his ""human oddities"" to his shows with the promise of steady pay and not human dignity. Or maybe they just have never seen any of the classic movie musicals with songs with witty, memorable lyrics.","

"anishchari","1 March 2019","The Greatest Showman is the most painful cinematic experience I can recall. I heard this is one ""the critics got wrong"" and with some skepticism watched it in its entirety. Had I not watched it in a group I would have turned it off after 30 minutes.The Greatest Showman is not a creative endeavor like any good art production should be. It's a movie made in a factory assembly line by a group of people who know what a movie LOOKS like, but lack any heart or imagination to cobble it together into anything but the most bland, generic pablum to turn a profit before heading back to the line to hammer out another one. It takes no risks and fails in almost all aspects of movie-making save costume design.This is the not-so-true story of PT Barnum, a public figure no one was interested in learning about and certainly not this sanitized version. It's a rags to riches story with some moralizing about tolerance and family that we've all heard a hundred times. But even these most basic of Hollywood sentiments they can't get right. It's supposed to be about acceptance and tolerance of people that are different, and simultaneously be about a spectacle of bearded women, extremely tall & fat men, and black acrobats. The black love interest may be the most offensive character, as I honestly didn't even know she was black until it was suggested as much by another character. They don't even have the gumption to cast a character whose skin tone is more than 2 shades darker than Hugh Jackman. The actual black actor has no speaking parts whatever and is more a prop than a character, as is the fat man and the tall guy. You know what would have been interesting? Making the love interest the bearded lady. But this is Hollywood and the factory specs called for just a teaspoon of diversity and nothing more.The story is a bore. The movie is scarcely 100 minutes but it feels like it goes on forever. It's squirm inducing from pillar to post, always threatening to end but never doing so. It's a risk-less, trite affair with passable acting performances and no stand outs.Oh but it's a musical you say, so it's really about the songs and choreography, right? Fine, but these echo the production ethos of the rest of the movie. Every song could have been ripped straight from the top ten pop hits and no one would know. And in fact that's exactly what they did, there are at least 2-3 songs that I recognize from top 40 radio. It is the most boring, milquetoast music available, made in a boardroom. Every song sounds the same and none are memorable. The choreography could have been pulled straight from any MTV music video - with the addition of a few CGI elephants, lions, and the odd flaming hoop. The most offensive moment is when an opera singer performs. Finally! Something that won't sound like a pop song. But what follows is more Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand than anything even remotely operatic. It was that moment I knew the movie was beyond redemption and would have turned it off there if I wasn't watching in a group.I am not a musical hater. You can make creative musicals like The Little Barber Shop of Horrors, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, I don't even mind the classic 90s Disney movies or the new Les Miserables. But this? There is exactly one song number that was at least mildly entertaining because it helped with characterization and had a glimpse of novelty: Jackman's duet in the bar room.Some people will argue this movie shouldn't have to take risks, it's a PG feel-good movie! But I didn't feel good. I felt a mixture of anger, boredom, irritation, and frustration. This should offend the sensibilities of any cinema-goer over the age of 15. The Greatest Showman is the worst kind of movie out there; so bland and produced it offers absolutely nothing new or interesting and the only thing worth discussing is how painfully mediocre it is before shoving it down the memory-hole never to be spoken of again.","

Having no knowledge of the character prior to watching this film, and basing it on a standalone film and not on accuracy of the actual person and events.This film has a decent interesting plot and several songs which are catchy and memorable enough, though for the most part, did not care too much about the film or overall plot.

"edwardsimilinicus","2 January 2021","I don't write many reviews. I have to be really compelled to do and this time I had to in the hope I'll save one poor sod from this tripe.I love music, I love film and I like the odd musical, not as much as opera albeit. This fails on all fronts. All the songs are that overly glossy, auto-tune ridden, derivative, glee-style trash that's so uninspiring. Just like the subject matter itself, there's loads of high production staging, choreography, CGI, etc. to make up for the lack of song writing skill. The big ""never never"" song cones close to decent (notice zero choreography) and the bearded lady's big number is ok but that's just because of proper vocal talent.It's so bad my interest waned after the 2nd song but I forced myself to see it through for a fair judgement. I've watched all of Cats for pity's sake! This is almost as bad. The pitiful story wraps up super fast with no real character development and I couldn't look past it was such a glossing of PT Barnum who was known to be of an unpleasant personality.Do yourself a favour and skip this. Go watch les mis or something properly good.","

"mark-durfor","22 December 2017","""Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed."" Phineas Taylor Barnum, best known today as simply P.T. Barnum, was born in 1810 in Bethel, Connecticut. In his early 20s, Barnum was a small business owner and founder of a weekly newspaper. He moved to New York in 1934 where his entertainment career began when he purchased Scudder's American Museum that he renamed after himself and transformed into a ""freak show"" playing on human curiosity with features like the Feejee mermaid and General Tom Thumb. Later in life, Barnum returned to Connecticut where he served as Mayor in 1875. He was an author, publisher, politician, businessman, and philanthropist, but is best remembered for his showmanship. It is that achievement that has inspired the new musical The Greatest Showman starring Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum.If you have read any of my previous Previews or Reviews for films based on actual events or people, I have given up on doing too much research beforehand as the movies often take many creative liberties with regards to the timeline of events, the location of events, characters involved, roles they played, and more. And they have every right to do so as the films make no claims to be historically accurate or documentaries. The Greatest Showman is based on the life of P.T. Barnum, specifically in regards to his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus dubbed The Greatest Show on Earth.Hugh Jackman tackles the title role of Barnum and he is no stranger to singing on stage or in film. Jackman grew up a theatre performer in Australia including musicals. The world was exposed to his singing abilities in 2012 with his role as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables, a performance that earned him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Jackman received both praise and criticism for his vocal performance. I was one of the critics asking the question ""Were you impressed with the performances in Les Miserables because you wouldn't expect Wolverine and Gladiator to be able to sing like that, or did you really think they gave the performances you would expect if you had paid $500 to watch this on Broadway?"" Jackman has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in The Greatest Showman and I enjoyed his singing as Barnum more than I liked his Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.Zac Efron's leading man roles in his career to date have been campy, goofy and sophomoric starring in such movies as Neighbors 1 and 2, Dirty Grandpa, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, and Baywatch. He is slated to play a completely opposite role as Ted Bundy in a film titled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile that could really reshape his career and propel him to a much higher platform possibly opening many more ""meaty"" roles for the young actor. His performance in The Greatest Showman was definitely a huge step in the right direction to separate him as more than just the goofball in crude comedies.Last year, when La La Land came out, I said we were long overdue for a new musical and La La Land was hopefully the first of many. Songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took home the Oscar for Original Song with their creation of ""City of Stars"" from La La Land. They're back and have written the original music for The Greatest Showman and I would be surprised if they didn't get at least one more Oscar nomination this year as it was the music that really stole the show. The Greatest Showman features a modern pop feel as team Pasek and Paul did not confine themselves to the 1830's when the film is set. It was a risk, but a risk that paid off. If they tried to fit the songs to the era of the film, I don't think this movie would have worked at all.I was excited for The Greatest Showman and had high expectations. I gave a 4.5 Star Prediction as I anticipated thoroughly enjoying Jackman and Efron's performances along with co-stars Michelle Williams and Zendaya, the music, and the spectacle from director Michael Gracey who literally made his big screen debut. He's so green, he doesn't even have a completed biography on IMDB. I had a feeling this would just the beginning for Gracey after a hugely successful Greatest Showman. I thought this movie was sweet, charming, electric, exciting, fun, and sensitive. However, I felt it should have been about 20 minutes longer than its 1 hour and 44 minute running time. Barnum didn't come from anything at all and swept his wife away from a lavish, wealthy lifestyle. She didn't care about the money. Their apartment had a leaky roof and no frills at all, but she and their two daughters were happy. After losing another job, Barnum took a risk and convinced a bank to loan him $10,000 so he could purchase a macabre wax museum figuring that human's morbid curiosity would draw them in. His daughters pointed out that it wasn't enough. He needed live spectacles. He agreed and searched for the outcasts, the freaks. He found his Tom Thumb, a bearded lady, the World's Fattest Man, the Irish Giant, the acrobat brother and sister, and many more. And it worked. People lined up and shows were sold out to see something no one had ever seen before.Barnum teamed up with the legitimate theatre producer Phillip Carlyle (Efron) to raise their show to the next level. It takes some convincing but Carlyle gets on board and it isn't long before their entire troop gets an audience with the British Queen. It's there that I feel the movie started rushing things. Providing a better life, a bigger home, ballet lessons, fancy clothes soon wasn't enough for Barnum. He became obsessed with people's opinions about how he obtained his wealth. In England, they meet famed European opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and convince her to tour the United States as promoted by Barnum. At her first performance, Barnum became infatuated with the ""legitimate"" adulation she received and started hiding his band of freaks to the shadows. It is Carlyle who first questioned Barnum, though he himself wasn't ready to be fully associated with them. His inner conflict was growing, however, as he had fallen in love with acrobat Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Barnum quite abruptly abandoned his circus as Carlyle abruptly became an outcast to his family and his upper crust associates as he fully embraced his new family in Barnum's absence. Almost as quickly as Barnum threw the origins of his success aside, he flipped a 180 and left Lind to finish her American tour without him so he could return to his wife, his children and his circus family. Local protestors threatened to permanently end their dream, but Carlyle's investments saved the day and the show went on. I really only had two big issues with The Greatest Showman. As described above, the flip-flopping of allegiance of both Barnum and Carlyle could have used a little more time in the film to develop and transition. The second was the character of Tom Thumb as played by actor Sam Humphrey, an Australian actor with a skeletal disorder that keeps the 22-year-old actor at a height of 4'3"" tall. But that wasn't short enough for the film as they digitally shortened his legs by what appears to be 6 to 8 inches. The problem is that you can tell he was digitally altered in every full-body shot he is in. He is also obviously missing from some wider shot scenes, when he should be in them. During the number ""This is me"", the cast of freaks are out in the public streets all performing together. He is there during close-up scenes, but when the camera pulls out, he is noticeably absent.Other than that, the songs really made this show a spectacle and truly entertaining. It starts with an anthemic performance by Hugh Jackman of the show's opening song ""The Greatest Show"" that has a similar feel to Queen's ""We Will Rock You"". Efron and Jackman were the perfect pair in their duet in the bar as they sang ""The Other Side"". Efron had a very heart-felt, sweet, sincere, beautiful duet with Zendaya as they battled with their feelings for each other as they sang ""Rewrite the Stars"". And the Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz (Keala Settle) led the cast of the circus in a triumphant singing of ""This is Me"". While the movie sold itself short in it's character and story execution, a shortcoming that really could have been fixed easily with about 20 minutes more, it more than redeemed those downfalls with some amazing original music that should get a couple Oscar nominations and probably one of them taking home the trophy. So, I predicted 4.5 stars for The Greatest Showman, I'm going to lower it just slightly to 4.0 Stars. It was definitely worth the money in the theatre, I'd see it again, and I'll be owning this once it comes out.","

"agauntt","3 July 2018","I cannot fathom why people are giving this a 10/10. This film is astoundingly bad. Every song is basically the same (start soft with hope, get loud and shouty, simmer down to a finale either with a whisper or a bang), the plot is vacuous and uninvolved, poor Hugh Jackman has to fight to make his amazing talent actually peak through. The special effects are distracting and pointless. Characters are undeveloped. It's like a family friendly Moulin Rouge covered in icing just conceived to sell a pre-programmed soundtrack designed by a computer to be as inoffensive and unsurprising as possible. If you like musicals and want to watch a modern take, watch Moulin Rouge, Les Miserables, even Beauty and the Beast! In terms of historic accuracy it completely underplays the exploitative and seedy nature of the industry that was birthed thus. I could go on.Honestly, don't bother watching this.","

decided to watch a movie in the evening and my kids said, 'Please please please can we watch the Greatest Showman?'(my husband and kids had watched it when I was out one night) and I agreed. I don't know what I was expecting, but that movie was AMAZING! The songs were catchy, and we have been blasting the soundtrack in our car all the time. The story was good, and despite the real truth about P.T Barnum, I loved this movie and recommend it to parents and kids who love musicals.","

"kimberlycvasconez","18 November 2020","I was absolutely astonished by how well this movie pulled together messages that are particularly relevant today as then. The film melded exceptional cast, script, vocals, acting and....dancing. We raised two daughters who dreamed of dancing professionally and took classes with the Rockettes and other professional companies. So, we are attained to great dancing and were astounded by the choreography and numbers in ""The Greatest Showmen."" Choreography in musicals are often ignored, but great choreography with talented dancers and main actors and actresses who are willing to put in the effort to focus as much on movements as they invest in their acting and vocals. Several of the back up actors were amazing and should have been featured included in extras on extended DVDs. I wish award organizations included categories for choreography and performance.Asa side note, a rumor circulates that those working for the Disney Channel are cursed and don't go far. I am always happy to see Disney alumni like Zac Efronand Zendaya showcasing their skills. The aerial dance training accomplished by Zendaya is very difficult and causes considerable injury. Our eldest took aerial dance movement while at the University and our youngest, experiencing dance injuries that were not properly treated, is waiting to enter a Doctorate of Physical Therapy where she plans to build a training program for dance teachers, choreographers and studio owners to treat injuries immediately and advise parents on what specialists to see.","

"hamilton-3","9 September 2018","The movie starts out with good energy, which drew me in. This is not really a movie about Barnum, but a musical based (very loosely) on Barnum's life. Accepting that, what can we hope for? The best musical theater will give you the pleasures of music, choreography, and production design. Exceptional musicals like ""Hamilton"" and ""My Fair Lady"" will incorporate great storytelling. Unfortunately, ""The Greatest Showman"" falls short. The production design is truly wonderful, and the choreography is okay up to a point. The songs, however, are pretty generic. Not a single memorable melody. They only serve the purpose to push the story along. And alas, the storytelling devolves into soapy fiction. There is an underlying theme, represented by Barnum's crew of freaks, of diversity and opposition to racism. Admirable, but weakly executed. Hugh Jackman does a great job of carrying this movie, but he is ultimately crushed by its burden of glossy shallowness.","

Hugh Jackman is very charismatic as P.T Barnum and Zac Efron isn't just handsome, but can sing too. Their joint musical number, The Other Side, is breath taking to watch. All the other musical numbers are superior, especially freaks This is me is outstanding. Over all everything seems to be in right place in this movie, but... Dramaturgy of movie is too straightforward. Everything seems to happen too easy. From rags to riches, getting arrogant, back to the bottom and get up again just happen, without any drama. Movie could be little longer and added more drama to feel more realistic. After all it is not a bad movie at all. It is visual, speedy and rhythmical movie. It sounds and looks great. Great acting, fine casting and well execute music numbers are great to watch. Clumsy script and lack of drama is still too verity.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","I can honestly say there aren't nearly enough musicals in Hollywood anymore. The Greatest Showman (2017) certainly helps to fill in the gaps between these occurrences, and with a subject that easily lends itself to the musical format. I really enjoyed the songs and choreography, as well as its message of inclusion and being unashamed of who we are. All that being said, there was still something a little off when infusing pop music and modern dance moves with the 1800's. It kind of works, but it also doesn't immerse the audience in the historical aesthetic.While the story of P.T. Barnum's (Hugh Jackman) rise to wealth and fame (or infamy, depending on the viewpoint) was entertaining enough, so much of its presentation seemed to have the ""Hollywood coincidence"" to it. Events lined up in such a way that I wondered if they really happened or if it was artistic license. This is also not to mention the number of clichés present in the film as well, most of which I can't get into without spoiling the plot. At the very least, Barnum's story seemed realistic due to his motivations, and not necessarily due to his humanitarianism.It might seem like I'm bashing this movie for being too ""Hollywood,"" but by that same mark, it is an entertaining film. There are enough humor and heartfelt moments to keep the proceedings lighthearted. If anything, the fact that it's entertaining is merely linked to Barnum's rise as an entertainer and showman. The songs are catchy enough to get stuck in your head, and the dancing (especially the bit in the bar) was dazzling to watch and would be fun to imitate. The Greatest Showman isn't your traditional biopic, but it is good for a brief escape from reality.An entertaining musical that hits all the Hollywood clichés, I give The Greatest Showman 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"gornasa","22 March 2018","I don't know what the critics are saying, but I know why so many people disagree with them. It is surely a pretty production with great attention to detail, and if you liked High School Musical 3, you're going to love this. In order to like this movie, you have to go in with a certain mindset because this movie doesn't aspire to be anything more than light-hearted entertainment. It instantly made me think of 'Sing', the animated feature with animals singing in a musical, and that one was way above this in terms of music and storyline. Here, the plot is as straight as a piece of stick, there is zero actual drama and character development of any sort. The only thing that happens is that P.T. Barnum loses his job and buys a museum, that's all the story summarized for you (without any spoilers).I enjoyed the music but yes, it's very pop and silly and for kids. Dancing is unoriginal and repetitive. And if you want to see how NOT to introduce the main characters' life stories in a movie, watch the first five minutes of this thing. Basically, it's a fast-forward version sung by the main character as a child - and the screenwriter didn't think you need more. Actually, the whole movie is like that - there is hardly anything to it, it's just a collection of beautiful images but there's nothing to make you care for the characters. All dramas are resolved with an imaginary flick of the fingers - one moment there's no drama, flick your fingers and you have a potentially dramatic situation, then flick them again and the problem is gone, and because the characters sing their problems away, you hardly notice anything happened anyway. What's the point of this? Hell, I have no idea.I didn't expect this to be some seriously ambitious musical, but from the start I was wondering, why a musical at all? I would've loved to see the story of P.T. Barnum as a proper movie with a plot. With all the money that went into it, it could've been something truly spectacular. As it is now, we don't get to see who P.T. Barmum was, and what he did, all we see is a bunch of weird people singing and dancing, and even that is an exaggeration because most of those people are just kind of filling in, they have no actual place in the storyline, they're just dressed funny but other than that they have no reason to be in P.T. Barnum's circus. If P.T. Barnum's show looked anything like what they show here, nobody would go to see it.Why did they use Barnum at all? Why not simply do a movie about SOME showman and his band of singing dancers? It actually doesn't matter that those people are freaks because that bit isn't explored at all. In the 21st century you'd imagine that this would be the perfect opportunity to squeeze in every controversial topic if you have a fat bearded woman here and an interracial couple, and a few other misfits. And yet, a circus that bases its feeling of family on the fact that they're all freaks, surprisingly avoids any real treatment of those various issues.There was more social commentary in 'Three billboards' - and that one wasn't impressive either.Honestly, the worst thing about this movie is that they involved the actual greatest showman and didn't tell his story AT ALL. The only thing in common he has with the main character is the name and his circus. I didn't expect a historically accurate movie detailing all the turns of the man's life but come on, at least if you're setting the whole thing in the times when he lived, then show what life was like then? The British queen that he meets is probably the single thing that tells you that oh, this is the 19th century. And what's with the computer-generated elephants twice the size of the actual animal in real life? Seriously, they couldn't get a live elephant to walk a few steps on the set? This movie is best described, in my opinion, as rainbow cotton candy - it is that colorful and sweet, and it has just as much depth in any way whatsoever.
I would've given it fewer stars but it does have beautiful sets, the costumes are amazing, the acting is good, and you'll probably feel a little bit happier after watching this.","

"jaezander","9 February 2018","I don't mean to discourage anyone from finding joy or meaning in The Greatest Showman, but as someone who values truthful screen adaptations and authentic intersectional representation in the media, I have some fundamental issues with this film. The Greatest Showman--even with its big budget, great cast, and good intentions on the surface--fails to come across as genuine to me. If I have to put aside the historical inaccuracies, I will, but not before saying that it was incredibly pointless to have this based on a real person. This film has nothing to do with P.T. Barnum--a man who grossly exploited the ""oddities"" of marginalized people to make himself rich--and I think it's in extremely poor taste to make a sensationalized, sugar-coated version of his story.But even after putting all of that aside, on its own, the film is generic and lacking a genuine commitment to it's message of acceptance and inclusivity. This has everything to do with its framing. At it's core, the film frames the white male protagonist as the hero of marginalized people, using the diverse cast of ""freak"" characters as a collective plot device to further Barnum's development. This is a problem for me because Barnum is framed to be without the prejudice others are so filled with towards the ""freaks,"" but never in the story does he actually defend their humanity or say anything to prove that he sees them as more than meal tickets. This is even more apparent by the fact that he never apologizes for having ignored and abandoned them. Furthermore, the majority of the ""freaks"" are lumped together as a whole, giving me no impression of their individual characters, their individual motivations, or any real impression that they have a working relationship with Barnum at all. Because of this, I can't help but feel that the ultimately inclusive message of ""be proud of who you are"" stems from a purely systematic view of the audience. Or, they wanted to make money, and so they hopped on the ""diversity is good"" train without really caring about writing a deeper, more meaningful story. Which begs the question, does this family film have to be more deep and meaningful? I guess not, it could be seen as harmless, but I, for one, have little tolerance for films that glorify reckless men like Barnum. I know its a simple rags-to-riches story, but if we're going to play around with empowering those who feel othered by society, I'd like something that doesn't revolve around a simplistic version of a historically problematic man that does the absolute minimum amount of work to represent people of various minorities. I think the people who were helming this project thought--maybe even subconsciously--that generic would be fine, relatable, and free of controversy. If you don't think about it too hard, it's a fun movie for the whole family, but I personally find this kind of storytelling irresponsible and in poor taste, especially today.","

"blanbrn","28 December 2017","""The Greatest Showman"" is one film that has themes of drama, doubt, struggle, and love and yet most of all it's a historical musical drama about how the legendary P.T. Barnum came about. As a kid you enjoy animals and the circus and enjoy sideshow attractions, well with this film you see how all of the makings and sideshow discovery things came about from one P.T. Barnum(Hugh Jackman).The movie despite having struggles of doubt, money concerns, and love drama is moved along just fine with great sounds of music as it's entertaining on the ears. And the growth along the way is seen of P.T. and his relationship with wife Charity(Michelle Williams).Overall this film is entertaining a good mix of sound with story that features drama and love and the performances from Jackman and Michelle is in top notch form as their screen chemistry makes this film a watch!","

My problem with this production is they used music from our time now (the style) for times that were happening in the late 1800's and early 1900's. Why not use period music? Totally didn't get that. Even when Jenny Lind sang... she was supposed to sing opera music...she sang a pop flavored ditty. The music did not work...at all.

It's an underdog who risks everything and there are PLENTY of hurdles along the way to get to the top, and Hugh Jackman is a great leading man in any role he's given.The best song in the film is easily 'This Is Me'; and all the other goodies are still memorable too. But it's that one song that truly shines: like a pop-song you first listen to and it feels like it's always been there, waiting to be discovered.The Greatest Showman; give it a watch and ignore Rotten Tomatoes on this one.

"rachaelperson","18 September 2022","I love musicals. I like Hugh Jackman and Zendaya. I went into this movie hopeful. Sadly, it's just not good.My number one problem is the music. A few of the songs were decently written and catchy, but the real issue is how overly-processed all of the singing is. Some of these people have sung professionally - surely they don't need this much autotune. And for the ones that aren't professional singers...it's a musical, why did you hire them. ""This is Me"" is the song that really took off when this movie was released, and for the life of me I can't see why. It's easily the most soulless, factory-produced piece of plastic pop music in the whole movie.The story is another problem: there is essentially no conflict. A guy wants to start a circus. He does. The end. What's concerning is that real historical aspects of P. T. Barnum are brushed aside to make him more likable. He wasn't a nice guy. Why not make a movie about that? It'd be infinitely more interesting than what's here.I know a lot of people really like this. I'm not trying to take that away from anyone who likes it. This just isn't good in my opinion.

"svhot","22 December 2017","""The Greatest Showman "" is a totally entertaining movie for lovers of musical-movies. The director and writers have taken the character of Barnum and put a sweet spin to his actual story. The alterations that have been made to Barnum's actual tale make this movie very refreshing. The songs are outstanding, the dance choreography is perfect, not even a minute of boredom is present, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman plays Barnum , a poor man , who gets the opportunity of getting married to the love of his life - Charity (Michelle Williams). Charity comes from a privileged family , and Barnum finally gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove his talents by opening a circus that soon becomes a huge sensation. However, due to his over-ambitious nature and personality, he fails to recognize the happiness that has been provided to him in the present ; he attempts to focus too much on the future. Hugh Jackman has given one of the finest (and perhaps sweetest) performances of his career. Michelle Williams also gives a good performance as his wife. The supporting cast have also given effective performances ; Zac Efron and Zendaya portray a young couple in love. The direction is also good.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because interesting stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth !!) .","

Doesn't negate the fact that Barnum was a conman who didn't really care about the people in his charge except to exploit them, not just in life, but in death as well.One of his most egregious acts was when he bought an enslaved woman and pretended that she was once owned by George Washington. When she died, rather than let her go in peace, Barnum hosted her autopsy in a New York saloon where spectators paid 50 cents to see the dead woman cut up. Didn't see that in the movie!Hugh Jackman tries to portray Barnum as a kindly smooth-talking Harold Hill-type when he was really just a cynical grifter. ""Rewrite the Stars,"" indeed.This movie is just an empty cloying confection of nothing to go with your popcorn.","

"rockman182","21 December 2017","Alas, the holiday season is upon us and with that the holiday season of films. A nice mix of buzzworthy films and Oscar hopefuls, this time of year is wonderful for cinephiles. I was mildly interested in checking this film out because it looked like a capable musical. After La La Land, you had to expect more musicals attempting to emulate that film's success. I have no problem with that, I have plenty of time for all times of films. The Greatest Showman stumbles on problems with its script and storytelling but make no mistake about this film having a glorious soundtrack and fantastic production and set design.The film is (apparently a rather loose) telling of the story of P.T. Barnum and his struggle to make something for himself and his family. His initial idea of a museum isn't a success but he get's the idea of an innovative form of entertainment involving unique individuals with rare talents formerly shunned as outcasts of society. Yes, this becomes the modern day circus. I don't know exactly how truthful this is to the original story but I sensed that this film is heavy on dramatization and made things more peachy and roses than they might have been.The plot is thin, there isn't a whole lot of development of side characters and you will feel like this film falls short ass a well written musical, like that of La La Land. It's well written in the sense that the songs in the film are quite excellent. Catchy, elegant, and near impeccable in sound , the soundtrack roars and impresses. The same has to be said about the choreography, the dance numbers, costume design, and the glitz and glamor of the early 90's and the grand circus theme. Its honestly a visual and sonic experience that's worth the watch alone.I also liked the fact that this film doesn't overstay its welcome with an under two hour running length. It sort of zooms by and perhaps could have added more meat to its bare story but I'll take that over a long and dreary musical that becomes dull because of its length. The Greatest Showman may get lost in the award season shuffle but it does its job of being a fun time.7/10","

Every song sounds like Vegas digital voice filter cheese.
A shame, because they could cut all the music, replace those segments with meaningful dialogue to link to the story, and have a great film.
It doesn't make sense to do a musical unless it's truly a stage or fully CGI production.
But the real sin of this flick is it sugarcoats the carny realities of seedy persons and hard labor behind the scenes...it makes a mockery when most accounts of PT Barnum feature the dichotomy of the ruthless man driven for making money behind the scenes, and the ringleader smiling showman to the ticket holders.
This movie feels like a cartoon version of a subject matter ripe for a better presentation.
West Side Story was iconic with great music and a flowing story...ALL DONE ON STAGE SETS! Why even go into this genre if it's not a full flowing musical?
Given the budget, cast & sets, I'd much rather this had just dialogue and a clever script.
If you like terrible 80's soundtrack movie musicals you might score this a 10 and hate me.
I'm OK with that. But I don't hate you if you have such terrible taste that you love this movie.

"jaredpahl","13 February 2019","I will admit, I'm a sucker for movie musicals. Give me genial, upbeat stories set to catchy music and I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws. Generally speaking, musicals are easy to enjoy, no matter who is behind the camera. The Greatest Showman, Hugh Jackman's musical biopic of circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, is indeed likable. Jackman makes a great ring leader, for the circus as well as the film, and the songs are undeniably appealing, but with banal, clichéd, uninteresting stuff going on between the music, The Greatest Showman is barely worth the two-hour investment.The film is very light on story. The narrative is your standard biographical retelling of an unlikely rise to fame. In this case, it's P.T, Barnum, who had an interesting real life, but whose circus' rise to prominence is rendered pretty well drama-free, here. The Greatest Showman pays lip service to ideas of self-worth and confidence, and it admirably creates a sense of camaraderie among the circus' entertainers, but whatever interest I took in the story was fleeting. The manufactured conflicts, including an interracial love affair between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, or a sub-plot concerning circus protestors, wear thin as they go along. The best musicals not only have great music and colorful dance numbers but a powerful central narrative. That aspect is clearly lacking in this script.Despite feeling like an old-fashioned Hollywood musical, The Greatest Showman is actually rather unorthodox when it comes to its music. The songs are all modern pop, which is initially rather odd considering the film is set in the 19th Century, but before the first number was over, I had warmed to the notion. Now I don't consider myself a fan of modern pop music, but these songs impressed me. There's a brassy mix of acoustic and electronic to nearly every song, and as a result, they all sound kind of similar, but I couldn't help tapping my toes to most of them. These are great songs. If I had one complaint, it's that the best songs seem to be loaded at the front.There is a subset of 30-40-year-old women who will absolutely adore The Greatest Showman. It is rooted in classic Hollywood, with a charismatic lead actor, a feel-good story, and wholesome themes. Yet, it's hip enough in its music to feel fresh. For that subset and others, that is all they will see. They won't be bothered by the lack of a compelling narrative or the shopworn clichés about letting your freak flag fly. They won't mind the grinding pacing or the chopped-up dance numbers that never linger long enough. There is a lot you have to overlook in The Greatest Showman to really enjoy it, but it is possible.63/100","

I am not one to usually watch these types of films, but this was just too good not for me to write a review on! The songs are incredibly well performed, the acting is outstanding, and the singing is just amazing. And I'm not afraid to admit it hit me in the feels a few times too. :)Go watch this movie! I can't recommend it enough! I normally review animated features, but this was an exception!","

But they can't be over crowded with music which this one was their is after doing the math only 45 minets of non music that's too much and the whole point of the movie is to show the people that are different and why they are still great people that was only touched on once. But their are so many other problems I would write a book if I wrote them all","

Loved it! The way the music and songs weave so impeccably into the narrative of the film is fantastic and they are just fantastic foot stomping singalongs that you just can't help but sing. Yes there are bits that are a bit cheesy but that makes it all the better. I eventually managed to persuade my hubby to watch it and now he is hooked too!","

"filakotekova","21 December 2017","This was magnificent piece of art, music and deep story. The actors did a perfect job. The songs were so amazing. I really liked that not every sentence was delivered by singing, but that there were just regular speaking parts and songs between. So even if you are not into musicals its very good movie for you. The songs and the energy in them were just awesome. There was not even a second where I would feel bored or not entertained. The story is amazing as well. Although some people may say the main character is in real life not as amazing as in the movie or was just selling not a real truth, well I am here not to judge, everyone has his opinion and no matter how it was, I just take it as it was inspired by some person with a great idea and its not documentary about his life so as a movie if its totally true or not, I dont think it matters. As a movie the story was amazing and very deep. I think everyone should see this movie. I wanted to watch it again right away after it finished.","

"abdullahkhanpathan","29 March 2018","The Greatest Showman, directed by Michael Gracey, is a star-studded musical which blesses our eyes with Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya
The movie starts with the character of Hugh Jackman, P.T Barnum, as a poor child who dreams of making it big to marry the girl of his dreams, Charity - the daughter of the man that he works for
As it progresses, we see P.T marry Charity and have two wonderful daughters all the while trying to make it big to prove Charity's father that he's a husband worthy of having. P.T has an idea of opening a museum, which fails but her daughters suggest that his museum needs more life and ""alive"" things. So, P.T auditions for people with unique characteristics that will attract audiences and sees his museum transform into a circus. 
Now there are some technical and narrative problems in the overall film. To begin with, there is a clear lack of depth in plot and story. For instance, the film ditches exploring various characters' lives. For instance, it barely skims over the main plot points to give us a summarised, not to mention historically inaccurate, view of P.T Barnum's life. So what could have been an adventure of a film, the writers instead chose to make it appeal to a mass-audience and in the process gave us a hardly memoriable story. 
Secondly, I can't help but say it, that the movie uses its songs only to tighten it grip on the audiences' attention. The musical numbers were forgettable, loud and for the most part glossy. Although, the choreography was decent if not brilliant. 
The fact that most of the acting performances were too sweet-mouthed and cringy also never helped TGS's cause. Zac Efron managed to shine, Zendaya as well, but Hugh Jackman gave a very ordinary performance and relied on his star power for the most part. Most dialogues were melodramatic and the presence of the extras struggled to contribute to the feel-goody nature of the film. The screenplay had some cliched plot points: a love triangle; the rise, fall and eventual rise of P.T Barnum. The predictability created disinterest and caused the film to fall flat on its wheels by the time the painfully long third act even began.","

I will give you, that the Irish population during this time period could run as high as 25% of NYC population. But, there were other ethnic groups (Germans) that were living in NYC.","

"nicholls_les","25 October 2020","I am not a big fan of musicals, but from the reviews I expected this to be amazing; it isn't.
Dull music that gets repeated so often it is annoying, The story was unbelievable and so far from the truth, P.T Barnam was a tyrant, he was cruel to his acts and his animals.
He was racist and he subjected an 80 year old black slave woman, Joice Heth, billed as George Washington's 160-year-old nanny, to horrendous mistreatment. Poor Joice was blind and partially paralysed, with just enough movement in her right arm to allow her to smoke a corn-cob pipe. She was also toothless. Barnum even boasted about how he'd plied her with drink and then pulled out her remaining teeth to make her look closer to 160.
Not surprisingly, she didn't last long - barely a year, and after her death, Barnum charged people to watch her body being dissected.There is also no mention in the film of black conjoined twins Millie-Christine, or black brothers, Eko and Iko, all of whom had been kidnapped from their parents as children for their 'freak show' value, and later acquired by Barnum. Or the dread-locked black males who were displayed in cages as 'wild men'.He was 60 when he started his circus business, he had 4 children not 2, and his children got older unlike the ones in this movie.The movie shows him resuing someone from a fire, but in truth, in the 1860s, his New York Museum burned down not once, but twice, boiling whales alive, roasting pythons and letting orang-utans and serpents loose to roam free in Manhattan.There is nothing about his endless failed business ventures, his obscenely hasty second marriage, after his first wife's death, to a girl 40 years his junior.Jackman has said, ' So many things that I aspire to in my life are embodied in this one character.'So Barnum is portrayed in this movie as a likeable, moral, skilled businessman, loved by all. In truth, during his later years, in perhaps his biggest fraud of all, he achieved the acceptance he craved from smart society by reinventing himself as a philanthropist, reforming mayor and anti-slavery campaigner. And he almost, but not quite, rewrote history so that characters like Joice Heth on whom he built his fortune, the twins Millie- Christine, or black brothers, Eko and Iko, poor little Zip the Pinhead - and scores of others like them - were forgotten.Just as they have been in the film.","

"burlesonjesse5","27 December 2017","The Greatest Showman is my latest assessment. It is touted as a musical. Therefore, how can I possibly recommend ""Showman"" if its best scenes don't involve the actors and/or actresses breaking into song.Anyway, The Greatest Showman comes off like hasty rags to riches stuff. It tests your show tunes patience but it could never be mistaken as boring. ""Showman"" is meager and flashy and I guess, betters something like 2014's Into the Woods. In truth, Into the Woods didn't have an actual hint of a story. ""Showman"" in fits and starts, sort of does. Throughout ""Showman"", I kept wondering what the late P. T. Barnum (the movie's subject and true-life inspiration) would have thought had he been alive to see it. He probably would've marveled at ""Showman's"" energy and playful, near period look. At the same time, P. T. would've scoffed at the lack of depth used to recreate his own life's account.The Greatest Showman feels like a modern day take on Barnum's inception of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. It has lavish dance numbers accompanied by contemporary melodies that pound you over the head with their Muzak-like senses.Rookie director Michael Gracey thinks he's making an Academy Award winner with ""Showman"". The unfortunate validity is that his film lacks artistic merit and has an unintentional ""popcorn"" feel to it. Gracey fills The Greatest Showman with plenty of razzle-dazzle. His pace is feverish with roving camera movements and a few whip pans. Sure his ""Showman"" has a narrative but its narrative is arbitrarily slight and takes shortcuts. Gracey would rather have his flick ""show"" off musically, freakishly, and visually. That explains the running time of The Greatest Showman which is a less-than-monumental 105 minutes.""Showman"", with its characters comprised of a bearded lady, a dwarf, and an acrobat, stars Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Michelle Williams. Jackman takes on the title role of P. T. Barnum. Jackman in a way, is almost perfectly cast. He's got the looks, he can dance, and he can act. The problem is that he's not much of a singer. As for Efron, well it feels like he took on his ""Showman"" role to shake off his image of appearing in lots of teenage sex comedies. Here's the problem: The Greatest Showman is not quite the vehicle to break Zac out of his raunchy, frat boy shell. Rating: 2 stars.","

"inkblot11","22 April 2018","PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman) , as a poor child, lived near a wealthy mansion, for his father worked at the ""big house"". Unhappily, Phinneas Taylor is left an orphan while his best friend, Charity (Michelle Williams), the daughter of the landowner, is sent away to boarding school. Nevertheless, the two continue to write to each other consistently, for the young love turns into mature love. Bringing himself up by his bootstraps, PT finally convinces Charity's father to give him her hand but no money is bestowed on the couple. Dad thinks Charity will realize her mistake and come running back. NOT SO! PT has dreams of opening a museum of odd things even as the couple has two daughters. The museum soons evolves into a circus, with Tom Thumb, a midget, riding a horse, a bearded lady and other bizarre attractions. Its a big success, even though some of the folks in NYC object to what they call the exploitation of the deformed. Hooking up with a talented promoter, Phillip (Zac Efron) the enterprise becomes even bigger. Making things complicated is Phillips admiration and affection for the principal trapeze artist, Anne (Zendaya), for she is a mixed-race gal in a time when prejudices are front and center. Then, PT gets the notion to put Europe's greatest opera singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Fergueson) on a tour of many cities. Will the distance between PT and Charity and the girls bring strain? Ms. Lind, after all, is very beautiful. Then, another tragedy occurs. Can the Greatest Show on Earth continue? This biography of Barnum is an old-fashioned tale of love, endurance, hard-work and gumption. What rare values in today's society! Yet, the very fine music and songs are contemporary, making one doubt whether the two will mesh...they do! Days after I saw it I was still humming the music. Kudos to the composers. Also fine is the cast, with Jackman's handsome face and voice leading the way. Naturally, the period costumes are fabulous while the script and direction keep the tale moving along nicely. Folks, are you looking for a movie in the vein of of classic musicals but with a modern twist? You will find it here!","

It is what Barnum wanted to do with his shows: just to entertain, thrill and just be enjoyable.And that's exactly what this film does and more. The soundtrack is an absolute revelation and makes me feel happy every time I listen to it in the bus or go out for a walk. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just there to entertain and help you let go. And I find too few of movies these days who can truly do that for me.","

"spencieboi","27 March 2018","The Greatest Showman is one of the worst movies of 2017, it sloppy, and stupid. The movie takes no time to develop the characters, it thinks it's so grand and heartwarming when really it's just plain bad. The visuals are terrible as well. The songs are catchy, but get annoying after a while because they all say the same thing. The songs feel so fake though, they feel like they've gone through a billion machines to make the voices sound better. The dance scenes are cool, but it's nothing compared to La La Land. La La Land takes it's time with the characters, the romance and the story, it moves along perfectly, not too fast, not too slow. This movie skips over everything important just so it can make you feel good about yourself. I understand how typical movie goers can enjoy this, if you haven't seen a lot of movies and don't go to the movies as often as I do I can see why you can like it. If you're a huge movie buff like me and have seen real musicals like Singin' in the Rain, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, An American in Paris, and The Red Shoes, then you should know that this is a terrible movie. It's stupid, and it's lazy.","

A musical is a story with musical interludes and this film had the musical interludes but no real story- you know- I didn't care about a single character, least of all Barnham.Thinking about it, this may have come across better on stage, with real, live performances rather than a whole lot of auto-tune- the songs are ok but they all sound the same, like they are all different sections of the same song; crappy pop-tunes in falsetto- no substance, no 'real' voices like Moulin Rouge for example- at least that was actually Kidman and McGregor's singing voices.Not great, won't stick in my memory at all- could have been so much more. I will most likely never watch again.","

"tyson-hunsaker","27 January 2018","""The Greatest Showman"" is a flashy and beautifully looking spectacle intended to showcase a real life based story on P.T. Barnum, the original creator of the circus. While not remaining true to the real story and drawing real inspiration from true events, the film boasts spectacular aesthetics and emotionally stirring musical numbers, the movie ultimately falls short of truly dazzling but simply satisfies. Every rumor about outstanding music and dance numbers are, off the bat, justified. In most musicals, at least one number can be pointed out which felt inferior to the rest of the score and couldn't quite escape the fast-forward button. This is not the case with ""The Greatest Showman."" Every number and song is one to listen and jam out to in the car and each piece is performed wonderfully by its charming cast and solid direction. The driving force of ""The Greatest Showman"" is indeed its cast and their unbelievable devotion to the film. Every performance exudes enthusiasm and charisma which gives the sloppy script and weak story more life than it deserves. Hugh Jackman and Zac Effron are standouts in particular with Michelle Williams coming in strong as always. Zendaya, as usual, didn't impress however and felt unemotional and unconvincing altogether. As mentioned prior, the aesthetics of ""The Greatest Showman"" are beautiful and astounding. Dripping colorful and lively cinematography, each shot contains wonderful pieces of excellent production design, costumes, and hair and makeup attention. The combination of these important elements help convincingly sell this movie and further immerse the viewer in a more classic feeling musical than what modern audiences are used to.As mentioned above as well, the film suffers from a weak script with messy narrative structure and distracting editing choices than hurt the film's flow and narrative. Unfortunately, the film's script tends to unevenly tackle 3 or more completely separate themes or focuses for the film. As each act is introduced with a new theme that neither contradicts or compliments the previous theme, so its impact near the end can leave the audience feeling cheated as we wonder ""Why did they tell this story in the first place?"" At the end, we feel satisfied with the high moral values the filmmakers chose to leave the audience with and it warms our hearts. As we think deeper however, we realize maybe we've been tricked as we think of the possibly relevant line of dialogue found in the film ""Does it bother you that what you're selling is all fake?"" Despite the apparent flaws in its written foundation, ""The Greatest Showman"" manages to entertain and satisfy audiences of all ages. This is a good film to show to younger audiences while older audiences will enjoy a trip to the theater with their family. The wonderful music and grand spectacle of the film outweighs the negatives and ""The Greatest Showman"" is indeed a solid film worth checking out.","

"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","6 April 2019","First things first this movie is extremely entertaining as a family friendly musical but I have the same problem with it that I've had since its inception, casting P. T. Barnum as an underdog hero undermines the horrors of the true story. Leave the real accounts of these characters to one side however and I don't have all too much of an issue with the greatest showman. The musical numbers are all pretty good and are accompanied by fantastic choreography. The cast are also great, Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams turn in performances you would expect from actors of their talent and Zendaya and Zac Efron really hold their own in challenging roles. I think there is a more interesting P. T. Barnum biopic to be made but this works fine as a family movie with a good message. With a string of lazy and annoying kids movies in recent years this is a film I would highly recommend to any parent. It Doesn't fully sugarcoat it's source martial but it also still wants you to route for Barnum, depending on how that makes you feel, this movie ain't half bad.","

Furthermore, the sets and costumes are beautiful. Truly capturing the style of the film. However, sometimes I feel the moral is quite heavy handed.

"JamesHitchcock","19 January 2018","""The Greatest Showman"" is that rare thing in the 21st century, a film musical made in the traditional style but not based upon a Broadway or West End show. The idea of the film was first mooted as long ago as 2009, but remained stuck in ""development hell"" for a number of years, allegedly because of the difficulties in obtaining funding for an original musical. It is loosely based upon the life of the 19th century circus owner and showman P. T. Barnum, telling of his rise from humble beginnings to fame and fortune. A key element is Barnum's relationship with his wife Charity, the daughter of a wealthy family who do not approve of their marriage. The crisis of the story comes when Barnum's circus is destroyed in a fire and Charity leaves him because she believes he is having an affair with the opera singer Jenny Lind; Barnum has to work to rebuild both his business and his marriage. A subplot deals with the love between Phillip Carlyle, Barnum's friend and financial backer, and Anne Wheeler, a beautiful trapeze artist with the show. Like Charity, Carlyle is from an aristocratic family, and his parents are horrified by this relationship, not only because of Anne's lowly social status but also because she is black. Hollywood is today rather more liberal than it once was about depicting mixed-race relationships on screen, although this film inadvertently reveals the continuing existence of some curious double standards in this respect. It seems to be easier for an African-American actress to find work if she is light-skinned or (like Zendaya Coleman who plays Anne) biracial. This does not apply to male actors; the actor playing Anne's brother is conspicuously darker skinned than she is, so much so as to suggest they could not in reality be children of the same parents. The Carlyle/Anne relationship, however, fits in well with the film's general message, which is one of tolerance, inclusivity and accepting who you are. One of Barnum's more controversial ventures- controversial even in his own day- was the creation of a ""freak show"", a collection of people of unusual appearance (a dwarf, a giant, a ""bearded lady"", etc.) who were exhibited to the public. In 2017 such a thing would be even more controversial than it was in the 19th century and it might have been easier to airbrush this aspect of Barnum's activities from the historical record. Instead, the scriptwriters make it a central part of the story and defend it by pointing out that Barnum was actually giving these people, who otherwise would have been shut away in seclusion, a sense of purpose in life and a means of earning a living. The film received mixed reviews from the critics, with one of the main grounds for complaint being its alleged historical inaccuracy. It does indeed take a number of liberties with the facts of Barnum's life, but was never intended as a strictly factual biography. It falls within a long tradition of novels, plays and films which tell an essentially fictional story based upon real historical individuals. There is nothing wrong with that. I would not, for example, recommend Milos Foreman's ""Amadeus"" to anyone wanting to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the lives of Mozart and Salieri- and yet it is still a brilliant film. This tradition goes back far beyond the rise of Hollywood- compare the plot of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" with the known facts about that monarch's reign. At the heart of the film is a magnificent performance from Hugh Jackman as Barnum, a man who is at the same time a shrewd businessman and a man with a song in his heart, a flashy showman and an inspired visionary. He receives sterling support from, among others, Coleman, Michelle Williams as Charity and Zac Efron as Carlyle. Most of the cast do their own singing, the main exception being Rebecca Ferguson, who clearly felt intimidated by the idea of trying to imitate Lind, the greatest opera star of her day. Actually, the singer brought in to dub her voice does not really sound much like an operatic soprano either, but then Lind's songs here are typical musical-theatre numbers rather than mock-operatic arias. The songs, in fact, are one of the best features, heart-wrenching numbers which add greatly to the film's emotional power. I was surprised to learn that this was Michael Gracey's directorial debut, but perhaps I should not have been. There have been a number of other directors who made a masterpiece at their first attempt. The classic example is always said to be Orson Welles with ""Citizen Kane"", but I would also add Bryan Forbes with ""Whistle Down the Wind"", Stuart Rosenberg with ""Cool Hand Luke"" and Sam Mendes with ""American Beauty"". And now Gracey with ""The Greatest Showman"". All those years it was stuck in development hell only go to show that some things are worth waiting for. 10/10 Some goofs. I will not list the various historical inaccuracies, because, as I said, this is not a strictly factual biography. I did wonder, however, why Charity's father always answers the door to his stately mansion himself- would a man of his wealth and position not have had servants to do this? And the scene in which Barnum obtains finding for his venture by offering as collateral a fleet of ships at the bottom of the ocean never rang true. The loss of an entire fleet of American merchant ships in a typhoon would have been widely reported in the press and the bankers would have seen through Barnum's ruse.","

"Molongirl","15 January 2019","Perhaps a little harsh, as I usually love musicals and some of the songs and dances were wonderful, dazzlingly brilliant and clever but it all had an underlying emptiness.
Maybe it was the subject matter, no matter how you spin it it was about a showman exploiting people to make money. He lied, stole and cheated; not a particularly nice character. There was some change of heart at the end in this film version of Barnum's life, but apparently not in reality.
Hugh Jackman was wonderful as were most of the cast and I wish they had been given a better story to tell. Was it made because it epitomises the ""American dream"", poor boy makes good and becomes famous and wealthy - at any cost - then finds his heart again?
Because Hugh Jackman was in it I couldn't help but compare this to the brilliance of the story of Les Miserables, which is about things that matter, redemption, goodness etc As against this shallow, grasping man's life story.","

The movie thinks it's so big and heartwarming and it just comes off as stupid. I love Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams, but they can do better than this pile of crap. It feels so fake, there's nothing special about it. It skims through the lead character's life like a children's book. Very bad movie.","

"mikezexcel","2 April 2018","I've seen TGS six times - about every 2 weeks since it opened. To me the film was an imaginative take on the man who created one of the most enduring forms of entertainment the world has ever seen. But the critical comments were not part of my experience. The following points seem to be the most repeated among the critics:HISTORICAL ACCURACY: This criticism is easy to dismiss. Unless the film is a documentary, the ""facts"" are subject to interpretation. A long list of movies based on real people or events bears this out. Consider this: If a film (non-documentary) were made about Donald Trump, wouldn't there be very different versions, depending on who's telling the story?THE REAL PT BARNUM: This can be addressed with my comment above. But I'll go ahead and answer those who feel that the man who was famous for having said ""There's a sucker born every minute"" had his character sugar-coated in the film. Those critics say he was portrayed as a saintly family man who championed inclusiveness. I don't know how they didn't see the same film I did. At a young age PT learns that honesty may not be the best policy when he is punished for admitting he made young Charity laugh. He subsequently steals, obtains a loan with false collateral, and embellishes his ""circus freaks"" to his liking. He even admits to being a fraud to the highbrow theater critic. And when he gains entry to high society via his partner Phillip Carlyle, he has hesitations about appearing in public with his human menagerie. I'm leaving out a few, but how many more character flaws do the critics need to see in a 2-hour film?NO BACKSTORY: A few critics lamented that the secondary characters (the circus crew) were not given full backgrounds. I can only shake my head and wonder how they could expect to pull this off with a dozen or so characters. Would they have liked a 3-hour movie better?THE SONGS ARE TRITE: Simple answer - one of the most revered songs in a film musical is about rainbows and bluebirds.NO REAL DRAMA: Sure, it wasn't APOCALYPSE NOW, but PT faced enough challenges in the film to dismiss that criticism.WEAK SCRIPT: Always a matter of taste, but I found it intelligent, engaging and very often humorous. I've laughed every time, particularly at the exchanges between PT and Phillip as they are trying to make the acquaintance of Jenny Lind in London. And the audiences I've been with laughed along with Queen V at the ""reaching the top shelf"" retort by Tom Thumb!SUB-PAR CHOREOGRAPHY/MUSICAL STAGING: Again a matter of taste, but after 6 times seeing the film, the musical numbers still give me goose bumps. The Other Side number, staged in a bar, is no less impressive than anything from a Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly film. TOO LITTLE/TOO MUCH: The Village Voice critic wrote that it was boring and exhausting - in the same sentence! So which one was it?!I personally feel that a clinical dissection of the movie misses the point. Maya Angelou said something to the effect that people don't always remember what you do or say, but they will remember how you make them feel. I'm glad I'm one of the many viewers who got such an incredibly wonderful feeling from THE GREATEST SHOWMAN.","

The cast is amazing, the songs are actually catchy, and the songs themselves actually advance the plot, something that irritates me in a lot of musicals where everything stop so a song sequence can occur. I've been a Hugh Jackman fan since I saw him standing in the corner of that ring in the first X-Men film, and just looking back over his filmography, he has made so many good choices even outside the more mainstream films (Prisoners anyone?) and he owns this movie, dancing and singing with the best film has had to offer. You will be singing the songs and you'll be smiling the whole time and honestly, what else do you want from a movie called The Greatest Showman?","

And the actual Circus wasn't started until decades later, when Barnum was 60.","

"coastdaze","2 January 2018","I start off by saying I'm not much into the newer musicals, I like a good drama but don't like characters breaking out into song at crucial moments! That's just too corny for my tastes.So on 12/30/17 in the early evening I had a couple of hours to kill...I decided to see Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman. I sat down prepared to see a great drama about PT Barnum when all of a sudden a song breaks out. I was bummed at first but then like the song and it ""fit"" into the scene. I was disappointed that it was a musical but oh well. OH WELL NOTHING! This is one of the most entertaining, happy, great acting movies I've seen in a long, long time. (And I see a lot of movies). Hugh Jackman is a great song/dance man. He's right up there with the likes of one of my favs, Gene Kelly, imo. His timing, his acting is spot on. To the point of I may like him better in musicals than dramas...not sure yet.And what can I say about Zac Efron? This man was made for song/dance. That is where he shines. The stupid comedies he's made should be the very, very last resort, if at all. They are a waste of his time and talent. I was entertained by his acting and singing all through the movie. I found a new love for Zac.The MUSIC is FABULOUS. I love every song...the melodies and lyrics were really good and totally fit the scenes they were in. I can't say that about any other musical that comes to mind. The choreographing was spot on, too. Every kind of body type got a good chance to shine, it wasn't just the tall or slim or pretty. Good job on that point.I loved this movie...the colors, the costumes, the songs, the dance sequences all were perfect and exciting. I left the theater feeling happy and excited about musicals again.","

"VikiLauda","27 February 2019","Well I am giving this a 4 & this is for the superb acting alone!
I love Huge Jackman & the rest of the cast, who all did an excellent job, but I feel their efforts were wasted with no character development, a very poor screenplay & poorly executed plot. There was so much promise with this movie too, I got the feeling wasting that promise with bad writing was almost a crime! This movie is certainly a ""Moulin Rouge"" for children!
Now lets face facts here Barnum was NOT a very nice character, & this could have been explored better. A very well respect monarch, Queen Victoria is displayed as a sneering, giggling characture & Jenny Lind was NOT some man hungry, marriage wrecker! But by far the worst aspect of this film is the music. Too loud, too auto-tuned, & all the songs sounded the same with the same droning message of ""We can do this, inclusive, empowered people"" followed with a deafening chorus & a bang! The only song I did actually like was the foot stomping one, (can't recall the name though) & the only scene I really liked was Zendaya & the trapeze which was done beautifully, & impressively. As for the rest of it, it felt like an overly long pop video.
The very scarce spoken dialogue was also far too quiet & just as you are trying to adjust your bleeding ears from the music, you can't hear a thing, which is annoying as you are unable to follow the plot (not that there was one!) The only other likable aspect was the awesome costumes even if they were not historically accurate.
Well, if you enjoy overly loud in your face fluffy pop songs, rainbows, unicorns & safe spaces then this just might be the movie for you, however, those of us who are old enough to recognize an invisible plot, bad screenplay & have delicate hearing, avoid this one at all costs!
Finally, a BIG well done to the whole cast! You did your very best! x","

The Greatest Showman was a passion project for Hugh Jackman as he wanted to show off musical talents.The Greatest Showman was an old-fashioned all-singing, all-dancing musical that had lots of energetic songs, even if the film did suffer from Frozen syndrome where some of the songs were overplayed. The opening number gets you in the mood and it continues from there. ""A Million Dreams,"" ""The Other Side"", ""Never Enough"" ""This is Me"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" were some of standout songs.One of the biggest criticism was the film was not historically accurate. This would be a more valid criticism if it was a serious biopic, but I am willing to make allowances for The Greatest Showman because of its median and genre.","

"OlgaGorelik","9 January 2018","It was an enjoyable experience, but they would have been much better off if the character ""loosely based on P. T. Barnum"" wasn't named P. T. Barnum. It isn't so much that factually maybe just 10% of it is true, it's that someone who was a conman and an exploiter is presented as this saintly pioneer of diversity. If they didn't insist on tethering the film to real people, it would have looked much more like an entertainment and less like a con. Take Jenny Lindt story. She is presented as an opera singer, which she was in real life, but then she goes on stage and sings what is essentially a show tune. She is there for the sole purpose of demonstrating Barnum's quest for class. Once that's achieved, more or less, they give her a completely ridiculous out. And it happens again and again. Just as I'd get into the mood with a musical number, which are all great, some real life related blunder would throw me off. And the other way around - there would be a nice genuine scene, I even cried once, and an out of place musical number would ruin everything. Circus freaks crashing a high society events? Interracial kiss? On stage? To applause? In mid 19th century? It's hard not to notice that kids don't grow up even though clearly years pass. And some of the adults look way older than plausible from the get go. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and truly a great showman, and it pains me to say this, but when there is Barnum as a young teen and in the next scene he becomes Jackman, coming to take his young wife from her parents' home, I cringed. And it took a while to get over that.","

(Yes, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron are excellent too.) Absolutely inaccurate as a biography of the true life of P.T. Barnum. He had 4 girls, not two. His museum was never called a ""circus"". His fortune was lost in a clock company venture, not by Jenny Lyn's concert tour, which made him a half-a-million dollars in profit. His first tent show was not in New York (city or state). A spellbinding-powerhouse of a musical from start to finish with incredible songs, production numbers, locations, set decorations, costumes, etc. Also a very financially-successful movie. Great family entertainment.A great majority of the film is carried by the music. (If you dislike musicals as being ""unrealistic"" then this extravaganza is not for you. Everyone ""bursts"" into song.) For everyone else it is pure joy. The depiction of the oddities and performers is quite accurate and very well documented.","

"Lejink","13 February 2018","It's funny but about this time last year my wife and I watched ""La La Land"", the acclaimed, multi Oscar winning feature which was proclaimed as the great throwback celebration of the Hollywood musical and we were sorely disappointed. This latest movie features a soundtrack by the same songwriting team and of course is likewise a popular hit, both at the box office and the music charts but still we were trepidatious to watch it, but happily this time we got it.Maybe it helped that the characters in this film were easier to like and relate to or maybe it's just that the staging, acting, singing and just the songs themselves were better but whatever the reasons this really was everything we'd expected. Both the title and the story hark back to 50's blockbuster ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" but even if there's occasionally a bit of a culture clash as modern musical stylings rub up sometimes a little incongruously against mid 19th Century Americana, the sheer energy of the piece carries it through.The rise and fall and rise again story of barnstorming circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum is naturally exciting, evocative and exotic with the viewer rooting for him and his band of underdog misfits all the way. The songs are terrific, the uptempo ones rhythmic and engaging, the power ballads moving and involving. The choreography and cinematography make excellent use of the circus backdrop, while the cast sell it for all its worth, especially the dashing and energetic Hugh Jackman in the title role.In summary then, a wonderful old / new-fashioned musical family entertainment which will have you singing along and tapping your toes to from first to last.","

"lasttimeisaw","31 December 2017","To accord validation to a biopic of the American showman P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), the creator of he Barnum & Bailey Circus (which was closed in May 2017 after 146 years), one cannot bypass its subject's money-seeking avarice and unethical modus operandi, above all, the exploitation of his dysmorphia-scourged menagerie from which he made fame and fortune in the first place, by that yardstick, Australian Visual Effect craftsman Michael Gracey's directorial feature debut is a deep-fried shirker, whitewashing contentions and generalizing conflicts in servile service of a dazzling holiday fare, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, its star Hugh Jackman's passion project for years, is still a spectacular crowdpleaser even crippled by its craven artistic slant. Gliding smoothly through its slavish rags-to-riches template, the film wallows in its old-fashioned flair and punctuated by eleven anachronistic music numbers fashioned by the songwriting team behind LA LA LAND (2016), as a result they are robustly modern, infectiously hooky and choreographed with a modish MV-style sleekness. Jackman is a real trouper as Barnum and simply amazing to behold and listen to with his virtuoso showmanship (alas, this couldn't be his career-crowning achievement), Michelle Williams is magnanimously given a solo piece to belt out as the benign, perspicacious but neglected wife Charity, yet for my money, the goosebumps-inducing earworms are Efron and Zendaya's trapeze-enhanced REWRITE THE STARS, the impact is more visual than aural though, and the belter NEVER ENOUGH (a pop standard instead of the usual opera piece treatment), from the Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind (Ferguson), voice provided by Loren Allred. Ferguson, again certifies herself as the most stunning star today who is still endowed with the rarefied classical glamor and poise, we almost immediately forgive Barnum's infatuation with her just because she is that irresistible, who wouldn't capitulate under her spell, which conversely, makes Barnum's resolution to go back to his family nigh on apropos of nothing. That said, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence, last but not the least, as a picture whose protagonist is patently heralded as a man who promulgates diversity and pluralism, the glaring remiss is that none of the members of Barnum's freak show is vouchsafed even a subplot of their own (the sensational Keala Settle as the bearded lady for instance, deserves her own tale of woe before triumphantly lead the center piece THIS IS ME), a lip service well paid thanks very much!","

"cherold","27 April 2018","The Greatest Showman wants every musical number to be a showstopper. If it were Music Man there would be no ""Til There Was You""; there would just be Ya Got Trouble over and over. Everything is big, flashy, building up to a crescendo that wants the audience to leap to their feet.For the most part, I wasn't leaping to my feet. A few songs rise above the noise, like the anthem-y ""This is Me"" and the zippy ""The Other Side,"" but often my reaction was, oh, this again.Still, the first time I saw this movie was on an airplane, and when I watched it again on TV it seemed better than I'd thought and I raised the score from 6 to 7. Yes, there's heavy doses of auto-tune, a tendency towards pyrotechnical high notes, and a preference for rhythm over melody, all reflective of top 40 radio. But at the same time, the film has some lovely visual ideas, like glittering stars on a ceiling or hung sheets blowing on clotheslines, and the sheer constant hurly burly of big moments and empty flash means that if you don't like what's happening right now, you might well like the thing that's going to happen in 30 seconds.Call it empty-headed fun. Enjoy the few people who sing so well that they aren't noticeably auto-tuned. Accept that almost everything in the film is untrue. And enjoy it.","

"gkeith_1","20 December 2017","Phineas Taylor Barnum is one of my biggest heroes in life. You all know that I just love musicals. PT inspires me all the time. He in real life was a marketing genius. If he were still alive, the Ringling Bros Barnum and Bailey Combined Circus would not have gone out of business in May, 2017. That was a total tragedy.I have studied this man's life, for many decades. Here was a man who came from a poor New England time period - specifically born before the War of 1812 and growing up in the midst of a financial depression - one of many U.S. depressions. He could make money from absolutely nothing. He found that people, a lot of them, would fork over their small amounts of hard-earned cash in order to participate in one of his hocus-pocusy outrageous ideas. He built upon these small successes. He was no dummy. He was very smart and shrewd. Eventually he brought the lovely famous Scandinavian singer to these shores, as depicted in this film. Jenny Lind Crib, anyone? Yes, her name is still famous here. More of his famous talent are depicted in this film, ala Tom Thumb. What about Jumbo, Barnum's famous elephant? I don't remember Jumbo from the reviews. Late in life, after several entertainment careers, he began his famous circus, with an accountant names James A. Bailey. After Barnum passed away in 1891, the circus kept going and during the decade of the First World War (100 years ago) merged with that of the Ringling Brothers. I have been out ill this year, having heart surgery, but I still have made a few movie reviews. This is one of them. Please post this review. I hope to see this new film today or tomorrow, Wednesday or Thursday. This Friday is my birthday. Again, I am an historian, with a university degree in American History. I am also an actress, singer, dancer, film critic and movie reviewer. I feel that some of P.T. Barnum's greatest successes occurred after the time period of America's Civil War. Certainly, his famous circus came from that historic era. I will give this film a ten out of ten, sight unseen. I just love musicals, so add more points. Everyone, go see this film. Have some fun in your lives. Phineas Taylor Barnum still inspires. Note 1: PT was the mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut. I visited there, looking for memorials to his life. I saw some, like a plaque in front of one of the buildings or perhaps the old city hall, in 2006. Note 2: I saw a PT Barnum televised film starring Beau Bridges as Barnum, some decades ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a drama. I don't remember it being as colorful, however, as this new 2017 Barnum is said to be.","

Colourful and bright with some big songs, the movi is actually just a conflicted mess. Whilst they see it fit to use language of the time to describe the ""freaks"" drafted to PT Barnum's show (all done in a quaint medley so we barely get any depth or interesting story), the music utilises a far more modern tone. There's be no issue with this (look how incredibly Lin-Manuel Miranda's 'Hamilton' mixes up historical period & musical style) but here the intention is totally unclear. Returning to the story, the main rags-to-riches-story of PT Barnum is poorly told. It's wholly unoriginal with huge story elements missed out (when he's told that his family is to be evicted from their home, we've had no proper indication as to how or why. His interest in 'incredible' singer Jenny Lind (she most certainly is not an 'incredible' singer) is dull and obvious, even though she proves a highly unlikeable character. As for Zac Efron's part in this big mess, it's hard to understand what his character's even doing there. Again, unlikeable and 2-dimentional, there's no originality in the telling of his and Anne Wheeler's mixed-race relationship story. This is a terrible movie which fails to tell an interesting story (a true story!). Entertaining only due to Jackman and Keala Settle's talent and some bright colours. Don't let the smiles and music deceive you - this is a poor film.","

"jonathonwisnoski-856-217430","24 March 2018","A watchable docudrama, in the same vein of many other recent docudramas, that is held back by poor writing in every department.This film is a musical, but the poorest example of the genre I have ever seen. It has one decent song, at most. And it gets so bad at points that it literally just has the actors use singing voices to read normal conversations and has these masquerade as song.But what really ruined the experience for me was the completely lack of any historical accuracy and just incoherence and nonsensical plot.","

I went to see this (for the first time) at the end of January and I loved it, I thought about it a lot afterwards, it really stayed with me, I saw it again a few weeks ago and it was even better, so much so I've preordered the Blu-ray and am going again before it comes out of the cinemas, the soundtrack is on repeat in my car and will remain that way for the foreseeable! I'm not the most eloquent of people so all I will say is give this film a chance, it's raw and emotional but uplifting and empowering at the same time, it made me laugh and cry and all the things in between, I urge you to see it before it leaves the cinema to get the full experience. Best film I've seen in a long time - and I watch a lot of films! 10/10 no question!","

"slightlymad22","13 March 2019","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to The Greatest Showman (2017)Following on from the misfires Chappie, Pan and Eddie The Eagle, Jackman was certainly not playing it safe with this movie. This film was a dream project for Hugh Jackman since 2009, and he really had to fight to get it made. According to Jackman, the seven year development process was due to studios' unwillingness to take a risk on an original musical.When the movie was in the process of being green lit, the cast had to have a full read through in front of the studio and the producers. Hugh Jackman had surgery on his nose to remove skin cancer. Hugh Jackman had 80 stitches and was told by his doctor to not sing. Hugh Jackman followed the doctor's recommendation until it came to the last song From Now On where Hugh chose to sing. Halfway through he noticed his nose was bleeding. His stitches had burst when he was singing. Now that, my friends is dedication.This is Michael Gracey's directoral debut. Jackman and Gracey met on a commercial shoot. Jackman told Gracey he wanted to make a film with him, and Gracey took it with a grain of salt (he said every famous person he'd worked with had made similar promises) To his surprise, Jackman later sent him the script of The Greatest Showman.This was hands down my favourite movie of 2017. My eldest son watched it on its opening weekend and he said i'd love it, and recommended I see it on the big screen, or I'd regret it. He was right, I loved it. It's easy to forget the awful reviews this movie opened to, it became a phenomenon as people went back time and time again. In the UK, it was in cinemas longer than The Last Jedi and it still playing in cinemas, when the DVD was released. How often does that happen? It was also the biggest selling album of last year in the UK. NOT 2017, when it was released, but last year. Recently, Jackman himself admitted his family are getting sick of hearing the songs everywhere.Hugh Jackman's charm makes it impossible to not get behind his PT Barnum, Zac Efron is clearly having fun, Zendaya is gorgeous (my son has a real crush on her) and is a talented actress too, but for me it is Katie Settle who steals the show as the bearded lady. Her song This Is Me, is now an anthem, that will be performed on talent shoes for a long time to come.It's filled with good, catchy songs (as all good musicals should be) Rewrite The Stars, A Million Dreams, From Now On, Never Enough, The Other Side and of course The Greatest Show are all great and over heardnkost of them performed on karaoke in the time since it's release.I could waffle on about this movie for a lot longer, but I will not bore you with it.The Greatest Showman grossed $174 million at the domestic box office, to end 2017 as the 18th highest grossing movie of the year.","

The plot is linear, no surprises and no one really tried to take us into the characters. The coming -problems- are constructed and obvious. Actually where is the moral about the people who do really bad things? The story obly leads to a soft-washed moral.Well, of course they tried to create and to motivate and to tell that every person is worth and that you shouldn't care about what people are talking about you. Only the people you love matter... well, that's the whole story. it might mix great films like -lala land- or -finding neverland- or -big fish- but it doesn't reach you emotionally.","

"hannah-mae91","4 February 2022","One of the most condescending, white-washed (not racially, they just spackled over the atrocious reality with sparkles and the magic of friendship) parade full of lazy pop music that expects you to get those shivers you get when music is really speaking your truth so that you ignore the dark empty void of the capitalistic monster behind everyone's eyes. I think I scoffed so many times I'm actually going to have problems with my lungs in years to come. It's like a production company sat down and purposefully asked themselves how to create a movie that made them look inclusive and encouraging of individuality while being so inoffensive and removed from reality that they don't lose money. I genuinely hated the process of watching this movie because I was with my mom who gobbles this cheap performative crap up so I couldn't walk out of the room or turn it off. Truly an awful film with vapid, soulless music. There isn't a shred of anything that makes it interesting or unique.On the bright side, P T Barnum would have been proud.","

"newnoir","2 March 2018","I remember seeing the trailer for this film around Christmastime and while I dug some of the actors I wasn't that impressed with it. A movie musical about the life of circus impresario P. T. Barnum? Cut to the aftermath of this film's opening weekend. It was written off as a box office bomb. Then slowly audiences made it a worldwide sleeper hit. Finally I saw it at a matinee and found it doesn't just grab you by the opening scene, it grabs you by the opening credits. The first of ten incredible songs takes you on this whirlwind musical journey that doesn't stop. Plus it's literally a highly colorful film that lights up the screen.Hugh Jackman as P. T. Barnum is perfectly cast a romanticized version of the flawed, controversial showman. This film was a true labor of love for Jackman, taking him over seven years to get it to the big screen. And much like the critics in Barnum's day, the stuffed shirt critics didn't get or like this film. One critics's review I read actually complained about the treatment of the animals in the film! When any astute viewer could tell all the animals were CGI! Another described the newspaper critic character in the film played by Paul Sparks as a weaselly little move by the screenwriters, guess that character hit too close to home for that douchebag extraordinaire critic! Those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, review.Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron have incredible chemistry in this film and the rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Keala Settle and Sam Humphrey all give fantastic performances. Though I would have liked have heard actor Sam Humphrey's real voice in the film and not dubbing they used.Musicals are all about the music and that's the catalyst that makes this great, albeit imperfect, movie musical great. That and great direction by first timer Michael Gracey.Here's one movie musical headed for its own Broadway show.","

Michelle williams cant act and zendaya is just wayy overated as well. Zac efron although usually good was just not believeable and the resr of the charecters just meh.

"webstercharlotte","2 January 2022","This one really has people going at each other and declaring war on those not sitting firmly on either side of the fence eh? Ah well that's human behaviour but I'm gonna wade in with my thoughts if not for morale support for only a small handful of others seem to share the same.The hype over this is something of a mystery to me and in the nicest way, I can only assume the majority that rave and can say nothing but good about this one are coming at it without having much prior knowledge or experience with musicals (or PT Barnum) but I'm from a musical / theatre background and later became well read and researched on all things related to the origins of the circus so can be accused of just being precious.Thing is, I'm not being precious at all. It's a really bright, colourful, dazzling confused mess.Starting with the good points about it - the aforementioned really bright, colourful and dazzling stuff which is what's so confusing and conflicting.The costumes, editing, choreography and music I can live with. Actually the music is pretty good I do like a fair few songs quite a lot and don't think they were badly placed or misplaced at all with the era as a lot seem to take issue with. It just feels like someone sat down and wrote all the songs, did all the choreography, sorted the costumes and props, got a shipload of coke for the CGI crew and then a week before its release they went ""Oh no.. did anyone do a storyline or plot or anything like that?""It really does feel like they had the best ingredients, the most lush recipe for a rich velvet cake and in the excitement someone forgot to put it in the oven.There is literally nothing holding the whole thing together and I did start to lose focus and fade out a bit so had to skip back to see what I'd missed between Zac Effron and Trapeze girl. One second he was seeing her for the first time and immediately falling in love and then next thing they have this whole ""We have come such a long way"" thing. I have no idea how got from A - Z but they did.Bearded lady is happily singing from behind a sheet hung on a washing line, Barnum rudely barges in all ""Ah my good lady with the fine beard and boobies I must have you join my show!"" and then next thing she's giving herself black eyes bouncing and dancing around with some strangely new found confidence that runneth over more than her top. It'd take some real bravery courage to bust out a routine with a beard like that but again - she found it and it comes from her hidden behind washing to leading a full ensemble.Backing dancers we're given a speed dating introduction during the scenes were Barnum is dishing out wanted posters for ""Unique Persons"" written by HR staff way ahead of their time and that's it. No other character development or real storyline or plot or anything in-between the songs is going on. They had a week to come up with something I'm sure but a quick read of Wiki must have thrown a spanner in the works so they filtered out the worst, tweaked the little things like means of extinguishing the fire (""Can we CGI belugas or do we just grab buckets from the storage? Yeah let's go with buckets. We're already on thin ice with the elephants and lions and stuff...)A huge disappointment and WTF moment was the scene where Barnum first hears and falls in love with the voice of Jenny Lind and I say disappointment because at the first chorus I went ""That's not her voice..."" and it distracted me enough that I paused the film to do a quick Google search and sure enough it wasn't. My issue isn't with her being dubbed and I appreciate the actress felt Loren's voice was more powerful and fitting than her own (agreed) but it showed and painfully so.On the plus side although a tad hypocritical and contradictory I know, at least Hugh Jackman was and is much nicer to look at than PT Barnum himself. If you aren't familiar - Barnum in real life looked like a thumb. Google him if you're not familiar. An actual thumb.I didn't expect much in the way of historical accuracy by any stretch but the origins of the circus and the individuals that formed part of Barnum's side show and freaks is fascinating to start with. I thought the whole thing about accepting people for who they are inside and celebrating the differences in all of us was going to be really told through the real life characters i.e. Bearded lady, Jenny Lind, General Tom Thumb etc.Bizarrely it makes the people they're trying to celebrate crass caricatures of themselves which nobody seems to have noticed.General Tom Thumb for example is depicted in this film as the wacky, crazy funny little guy struggling to stay balanced on the back of an elephant calf. In reality he became wildly rich, famous and even bailed out Barnum when he hit the skids and needed money. He married, had a family, had his own purpose built home made and like, love or loathe Barnum, the man did him this opportunity which would not have been afforded anywhere else at all.The hate from people that take issue with ""glorifying"" Barnum to me is right out of the idiots pocket book guide on how to be offended and woke with all the other cool kids. Barnum never claimed to be much beyond a businessman and those he exploited he actually gave an opportunity to avoid being horribly exploited and abused as was pretty much standard at the time.What I will say is this would have been superb if they'd taken it straight to the stage. It feels like it was born for Broadway and as a live production, would have more time to develop and been a strong show.The same music, choreography and talented cast - even including some lighting trickery or puppets for the animals - I imagine it as being an absolutely superb but even bigger, better version of Circus 1903PS. Seriously - Barnum looked like a thumb.","

I gave it a 2/10 mainly because this is a musical with bad music. I mean no disrespect to all those who worked hard on this production, but it is as if persons with no musical talent composed and performed the songs here. I actually fast forwarded much of the singing as the music was so bad, and the plot and character development were so hasty and cursory that that part of the movie failed and flailed as well. On the bright side, it was visually appealing when on mute. Sorry, but this musical is not a must see, and I liked many of the actors, but it just doesn't work as a complete movie.","

It revived her interest in musical theater, though she was quickly let down with Into the Woods, which we watched next. I knew (and know) next to nothing about P. T. Barnum, and was surprised to see the emphasis on the display of disabled people in his museum and then circus. The movie (Controversially? Wikipedia says little about this) depicts Barnum's efforts at recruiting them as a means of celebrating diversity, and his protection of them (despite one key rejection before high society) is contrasted with the drunken mob that attacks them and burns the circus down. An interesting perspective, and I wonder where it comes from. My children sympathized with these performers, at least, and loved the movie for them more than the Showman himself.","

"neil-476","1 May 2018","Impoverished Phineas Barnum marries a girl from a rich family against the wishes of her parents, and proceeds to make his fortune by presenting displays of the rare and unusual, including people with attributes which have them labelled as freaks.Hugh Jackman plays Barnum in a musical celebration of the positive elements of his career (as a frosty critic tells him, some might say that it is a celebration of humanity). His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride. Well, content-wise it is fairly standard fictional biopic stuff, but the musical numbers are the best I can recall for some time.","

"MrDHWong","19 April 2018","The Greatest Showman is a musical drama film loosely based on the life of circus showman P. T. Barnum. Starring Hugh Jackman in the lead role, it is a dazzling and fun showcase of Jackman's talents as an actor and an interesting look into the life of its main subject.In New York City, P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) lives with his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) and two daughters in a basic house working a menial office job. Despite their relatively simple life, Barnum has ambitions for greater things and after losing his job, he takes out a huge loan from the bank to start his own wax museum of oddities and freaks. After slow business, Barnum's daughters suggest showcasing ""living"" exhibits and so decides to recruit real life performers for his museum, eventually leading to a high number of attendance from curious spectators.There's no denying The Greatest Showman has irresistible dance numbers, memorable songs, and an interesting plot, but unfortunately the story does feel predictable at times and some of Barnum's circus performers feel annoyingly underdeveloped. It's a shame the film does not focus enough on personalities of the other performers, outside of the fact that they're human beings rather than ""freaks of nature"". Despite this, the acting from its cast is solid, particularly Hugh Jackman in the title role, who is a delight to watch from his energetic presence to his dramatic sincerity. As far as modern musicals go, this is one of the best.I rate it 7.5/10","

The methods are not eloquent, nor subtle, but simple-minded. E.g. Its constantly things like 'you cant date someone darker than you'. - like sitting in a college sociology class. Would it not have been less preachy just to have them date, I mean, High School Musical people werent complaining that Zack dated an equally tan girl.Sure, messages of kindness to others is important, but somehow this seemed to be one giant 60's gender-rebellion escapade typical of Broadway, instead of some fun family movie, that is so pervasive in Hollywood movies now.

Overall I think my suspicions were right in this is a very average movie.I'll start by saying I love musicals, so this is in no way an attack against all musicals. Greatest Showman as a whole just was not a very good musical. Yes there were some immensely talented performers. And yes there were one or two really good songs, but the rest were very lackluster. Most of the performances were just completely forgettable. I really wasn't a fan of the story of the movie either. Hugh Jackman did his best but PT Barnum was just not a sympathetic protagonist. I really found myself not liking the character as the film went along.Singing wise Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron did a solid job all around. Those two men are great actors and it's easy to forget that they are also excellent musicians. Unfortunately neither were working with the greatest material.I really think in a more skilled directors hands this could have been a better movie. As it stands it is a relatively forgettable lighthearted popcorn flick. A 6.5 out of 10.","

You know, some level of actual dialogue to add depth and amazing circus performances to truly show what it was all about. What I got was a bunch of contemporary pop songs crammed together as if it was just one massive music video with terrible cgi. The music although okay at parts just didn't fit the time period for me at all. It threw me off. The movie was full of colour and happiness when the reality was far from it. It glorifies darkness. Felt almost like watching Pitch Perfect really. Anyways that's my opinion. Wasn't what I expected, failed to amaze me, overall boring.","

"davidgee","17 February 2018","This musical extravaganza on the life of P.T. Barnum is pitched at the X-Factor audience, much as MOULIN ROUGE was a few years ago. Don't expect to hear Hugh Jackman singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning' (which he has sung on-stage). It's not that kind of show. The songs are loud, with repetitious lyrics, staged like pop videos. P.T. Barnum was a 19th-century showman, but this is a decidedly 21st-century show.Zac Efron provides eye-candy for teenage viewers, but the movie totally belongs to Jackman, sounding better than he did in LES MIS and dancing like an Olympic athlete. Political correctness has diluted the 'freak show' with which Barnum begins his circus career - there's a bearded lady (with a fine belting voice), Tom Thumb and dancing Siamese twins, even a 'Wolf Boy', but nothing as grotesque as the Elephant Man, who, with other tragically deformed people, provided the 'lure' for punters into Barnum's circus.

This is not my idea of what a musical should be, but it's dazzlingly staged and performed with great exuberance and - somewhat against my better judgement - I enjoyed it!","

"a_sad_cow","2 January 2018","Not my genre, so I was a bit skeptical, but this is truly masterfully done. Many times in the same scene you can see P.T. Barnum as he saw himself, as others saw him, how he saw the world, and how the world saw his business. For the dance numbers, there were some subtle effects with brilliant timing. At first glance you might think of just the slow motion and real time synced appropriately to the music, but Hugh Jackman worked some magic with some stage props and a talented cast.They also didn't miss a subtle humanitarian message that the mere creation of the circus addressed in its time. Being as society has largely learned what it can from this phenomenon, this movie also serves as a sort of time capsule to help ensure those lessons aren't lost. I haven't seen a proper circus in decades, and figure the industry is slowly dying.This is a movie for everyone. Bring a date, bring the family, bring the kids!","

"Cineanalyst","16 September 2020","""People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked. Just once, I'd love to give them something real.""The great, self-serving irony of ""The Greatest Showman"" is that supposedly being hoodwinked is what's real, whereas that purported as real is a classist fraud perpetuated by snobs and joyless critics--perhaps, like the very ones who panned this movie (checking as of this writing, it holds a poor 56% score on Rotten Tomatoes). As opposed to the depiction here of the historical figure of P.T. Barnum, however, whose humbuggery hardly extends any further than padding the weight of a fat man or selling a tall guy, for whatever reason, as Irish, the movie itself is largely a fiction debased from the historical record. Nevertheless, ""The Greatest Showman"" is an immense, musical spectacle, and I can appreciate the symmetry of a movie that lies about a showman who likewise deceived. This reflexivity, however, is, again, self-serving and nothing along the lines of, say, ""F for Fake"" (1973) is done with the illusion beyond the preservation of it.I learned a bit about the historical Barnum as ancillary to my studies of itinerant exhibitors of early cinema, who would incorporate some of the same sort of variety acts and showmanship into their entertainments. The scene in ""The Greatest Showman"" of the light-and-shadows show Barnum gifts his daughters is a nice touch in this regard, alluding to the future spectacle and novelty of motion pictures. My favorite scene, too, might be the rebuke of Disney, with a young Barnum stealing a loaf of bread as though he were Aladdin, then, being offered an apple by a woman recalling Disney's typical association of ugliness with villainry in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), which makes it kind of ironic that I viewed ""The Greatest Showman,"" originally distributed by 20th Century Fox--a studio since acquired by Disney, on Disney+.I also appreciate the analogy here of racial discrimination with that against the so-called ""freaks"" of Barnum's show, although the fictional interracial romance between two fictional characters hardly rises above an ancestry commercial. And, before turning Barnum into some handsome white savior and although he reportedly became an abolitionist, his start in showbiz wasn't offering dignity to a dwarf; he purchased a person and touted her as the 161-year-old slave of George Washington--later exposing the hoax, too, by charging admission to an autopsy. That doesn't make for a fluffy, sometimes-repetitive musical, though.Since they fictionalized history, however, I still would've hoped they wouldn't do so as to make some of the women in the story less compelling and, in the case of the real singer Jenny Lind, into a libelous homewrecker trope. Michelle Williams, too, as the housewife is wasted. A talented actress, she's proven that she can do well even with small roles (""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016), e.g.), but there needs to be some promise to the part--something more than being required to smile and stand by the Hugh Jackman song-and-dance show. Yet, ""The Greatest Showman"" is admittedly spectacular eye candy, with pleasant dancing and musical numbers, including the Oscar-nominated ""This Is Me."" Sometimes it may, indeed, be a pleasure to be hoodwinked.","

"nogodnomasters","10 January 2018","This is a musical biopic of PT Barnum. Like ""La La Land"" it includes people who should never be in a musical. Zac Efron needed a voice cutter to sound acceptable. Hugh Jackman was hit and miss, mostly a miss. Better than Russell Crowe, but not as good as Emma Stone.I don't know why casting directors insist on putting people with less than stellar quality voices into musicals when there is so much talent out there. However, there were good performances Keala Settle and Rebecca Ferguson. The music was uplifting and sounded as if it was uplifted from Katy Perry tunes...which would have worked better in a few instances. The theme of the film comes out at the end which was one of diversity and equality which is why Hollywood loved it considering the age in which we live.","

"Seraphima12","5 January 2020","A very disappointing in terms of a movie. The story line is weak and left to bare minimum, the motivations of the characters are not clear, and the characters themselves are reduced to clichés. The title does not live up to the expectations - I still cannot perceive why the main character was a great showman?? Colleting 'freaks' and showing them to the public does not make anyone a great showman. Also, the movie seems to be patched together with a series of short music videos, some of which are quite repetitive in terms of choreography and execution. On the positive side, the costumes are lavish, the topic is intriguing, there are some interesting findings in terms of movie shooting and editing. But overall, the movie is not worth watching as it is void of meaning.","

He cried. And neither of us are crier.What stands out are the songs. They are incredibly modern BUT the coreography is amazing.The casting was done perfectly. Even the small kids dancing pulled it off.The only flaw of the movie was when the pace between two of the songs were too fast. That Zac-song and Michelle-song should have been a bit better slow-paced.This soundtrack is on non-stop at my house and the entire movie keeps my anxiety to rest.","

"UberShell","12 January 2021","Let's not beat around the bush here. I hated this film. With a passion.It has received such acclaim that I actually watched it a couple of years later to see if I'd been having an off day when I formed my opinion the first time around. Nope. Still hated it.I'm so utterly baffled by my response to it. I feel as though I must perhaps be watching a different film as my view on it varies so greatly from the view of all my friends on it who all loved it and think the songs are great.I wanted to like it, I really did and there are elements of it that I do like.I adored the costume and sets.The story is OK and Hugh Jackman is really good in it.Performance wise he does a great job, but I hated the songs with a passion and as it's pretty much all songs, it totally ruined it for me.If you're the kind of person who likes TV talent shows and generic pop music then you'll probably like this music too, but the music left me cold.There is one song in the entire film that didn't make me want to reach for the ear plugs (the song and dance routine in the bar which I could tolerate) and visually it is very lovely, but for me, the songs were just utterly awful - to the point that I couldn't help myself from groaning every time a new song started!Perhaps if my daughter was still young and I'd shared the watch with her and seen her get swept away with it (it's a grand production that's for certain) then I might have liked it more, but as an adult who hates pop music, I could find a few redeeming features, but not enough for me to regard it as a good or enjoyable film by any stretch.","

"austinatmeetup","10 July 2018","I stayed for one hour, couldn't stand it any more. Costumes were great. Hugh Jackman seems to excel at period films. Unfortunately, it was a musical (which one doesn't learn from the trailer), and unfortunately, the music was terrible. So it was hard to sit still for the music, and finally I couldn't sit still for it any longer. It reminded me of the music in Dream Girls and also La La Land, which was all over the place. I don't know how a singer would even be able to memorize this stuff. It doesn't follow normal musical patterns. Later it occurred to me that it seemed like they were playing the same tune over and over with different words. This didn't have to be a musical with terrible music. If it had just told a story, it would have been all right, although, based on what I've read, the story it did try to tell wasn't even accurate, and it hides a lot of bad stuff about Barnum. I just looked up a review, and it says this tony-winning duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul composed this music and that they also composed the songs for La La Land. Well, that's not surprising. I walked out on La La Land also. I love good musicals, but this was not one. I would rate it 1 or 2 except that the costumes and the scenery were quite attractive.","

"st-shot","23 January 2018","Showman / conman PT Barnum gets the same kid glove treatment Flo Ziegfeld received in 1937 with this antiseptic look at his life and legacy. Filled with a fair share of catchy tunes, a couple of impressive dance numbers and lush production values it mawkishly keeps things saccharine to the point of not allowing PT's kids to grow up over a period of years along with shouldering singer Jenny Lind with the blame regarding her nebulous relationship with Barnum when he had her under contract. It's understandable for a musical to do so but the story in this case is too timid to maintain the energy level between musical numbers.The dance segments are simply over edited cheating the audience out of a more fully fleshed out Hugh Jackman performance. A major broadway performer and fine hoofer, Jackman's numbers are simply cut to pieces in jump cuts that reduce him to a twirling top. Director Gracery also shortchanges his dance troupe as well by truncating movement and allowing the camera to move more than the dancers, the editor's blade obliterating their abilities and contribution. The numbers are slick and energized but at great disservice to the talent performing it and the audience being denied it.","

Some of the scenes could be the best with dancing and special sounds created by the glass, wood and chairs - which is rarely found in other musicals.This is one of the few movies that can make me so impressed and sit on the chair to watch the entire credit scene because I just don't want to leave the cinema so early.The box office may be a bit disappointed due to reputation or the film type. But I am sure a good product will have good results. This movie is perfect for children and family to watch and enjoy. The content is so positive and change your feeling from scene to scene.I 100% recommend to whom may like watching La La Land. La La land is a great movie. This Showman is even better from my point of view.","

"aandwdabest","22 January 2018","To me, La La Land was the defining musical because it captures the glowing magic of LA as well as people who live and breathe in it. The music was somberly calm and moving, each notes switch seemingly back and forth between the crushing reality and the beautiful fantasy. The ending is one of the best in the musical, because it is bittersweet, and it leaves room for ponder.Many people call the greatest showman a surprisingly better musical, unlike the critical review which is justifiably mixed. The music was unfittingly modern and sluggishly factory made, but Hugh Jackman, with his incredibly solid musical theatre root, made the entire experience more charming and bearable - and same goes to Michelle Williams, Zendaya, Zac Efron and the ensemble (with the fat bearded lady being the highlight of it). The story was quite formulaic, and it really added nothing to the table. I sat in the theatre trying not to make myself cringe throughout the entire experience, with my family members and my best friends surrounding me. I m sorry guys, but this film is cringingly mediocre.","

"jyer-74265","28 June 2021","The greatest showman allows Hugh Jackman to be at his Broadway best. And the musical sequences are some of the most fun the whole family to singalong (especially in 2nd and 3rd viewings). Although like many semi-biographical movies, after the first act it feels like the writers are just trying to think up conflict that ultimately wasn't unnecessary.The compelling story is the protagonists ability to come from nothing himself and rise whilst empowering the less privileged circus performers.The plot leads the lead character down a path of simply using the ""freaks"" for his own self benefit and when a ""better option"" presents itself he takes it - only somewhat redeeming himself once his ""better option falls through.Whilst it's an ordinary at best script - this shouldn't takeaway from the casts musical and performing excellence.","

"tierneyreardon","8 June 2018","I went into this one expecting something special. Hugh Jackman sure does like his musicals. And I had heard Zendaya was in it, so how bad could it possibly be?Still pretty bad. I'm giving this 3 stars, not less, because:There's some pretty great choreography in this one, I have to admit. Zendaya and Zac Efron are in this, and their song is particularly well done. That trapeze choreography stuff? That was awesome.Hugh Jackman gives it his all, you've got to give him that. He might be pulling that weird half-grin face the entire time, but you can tell how much he's loving being in another musical. I'm certainly not giving this more than 3 stars, because:It's an entire movie romanticizing the life and legacy of P T Barnum, who is in absolutely no way someone who I can root for. Mr. Barnum's first 'freak' that he put on display was a 70 year old black slave. He first began putting her on display when he was in his early 20s. He claimed she was the 200-year-old nanny of George Washington. When she died a few years later, he charged tickets for people to watch her autopsy. Wonder why the movie didn't cover this aspect of his life?The songs are all vastly different, and the lyrics are vague enough that they seem to have been designed so that they can be blasted on the radio and soundtracks will be bought. Jenny Lind. All of Jenny Lind. Once again, Ms. Lind was a real person - a Swedish opera singer who donated a small fortune to charity. The movie has portrayed her as wanting nothing but to seduce P T Barnum and ruin his marriage. When he turns her down, she attempts to destroy his life, and cancels the tour. What really happened is that Barnum's marketing strategies began to make her uncomfortable, so she stepped down from going on tour with him. As if this portrayal wasn't inaccurate enough, her one song in the film is some kind of Adele-style pop ballad. Not exactly what I was expecting from an 'opera singer'.Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters are in love, and the movie attempts to portray an interracial relationship in a time where black people in London were still being kept as slaves, their lives endangered. P T Barnum even hires Zendaya and her brother, telling them that he wants the crowds to be outraged to see black trapeze artists performing. This attempt at an interracial relationship portrayal could have been good, but they boil it down to Zendaya going ""No,,, we can't be together,,,"" and Zac Efron going ""Why are you so afraid of what people think?"" This is after he is ashamed to be seen with her in public earlier in the film, too. Honestly, this was the laziest sub-storyline I've ever seen. Zac and Zendaya are gorgeous but this was honestly one of the aspects of the film that irritated me the most.Some real bad child actor singing. Really, really bad singing.That scene where Hugh Jackman rides a CGI elephant through the streets of London to meet his family, then dismounts the elephant and runs off, leaving it randomly standing in the middle of the city. P T Barnum is a dick to elephants. If they had just made a musical about a man who starts a circus, this could have been alright. Trying to root this in history then massively failing to accurately portray Barnum and Jenny Lind just made this even more of a flop.","

"JonClifton1","30 December 2017","I went into this movie with extremely low expectations and came out feeling even more disappointed than I did going in. Hugh Jackman stars in this lackluster musical about inclusiveness and friendship and at the end it's all tied up with a bow about how money doesn't mean happiness. Blah. P.T. Barnum, infamously known for the phrase ""There's a sucker born every minute,"" lacks any edge in this musical. You'd think anything could be saved by the lyricists (who did La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen) but everything hits a sour note. Auto tune is obviously used, the editing of this film is awful, and the camera movies are choppy and uninspired. Just when you think the original musical is making a comeback you get a piece of crap like this. Not worth the money or the time, unless you like heavy handed messages being shoved down your throat. This movie could have had some edge ANY edge just to keep it interesting but instead the beats are the same and everything falls flat. You will definitely want to avoid this disaster of a movie. 2/10","

"PradoCedric","12 April 2018","As much as The Greatest Showman delivers greater performances particularly from most of the cast with the likes of Hugh Jackman (who never disappoints), Zac Efron, Keala Seattle, Zendaya, Michelle Williams and others and even the music and soundtrack that was supposedly to be looking and sounding as ""superb"", this movie suffers a greater let-down and a wrecking mess in which greater performances from the cast couldn't redeem it.First of all, the direction is really off the rails given the fact that the film's director Michael Gracey whose track record was based on directing music videos was unable to deliver a solid direction that could have made the film more livid and intriguing, and not to mentioned it's stale, weak and mediocre and coming off as a Baz Luhrmann-Moulin Rouge style knock-off. Second, the writing is rifled with major historical inaccuracies considering that this film is based on a true story of P. T. Barnum and his circus and its depiction of the story made it uninspired, inaccurate and at worse, erroneous given the main character's background being seen with darker and questionable history and even dreadfully ignored the circus' dark past in favor of a fictitious cringeworthy and shmaltzy depiction. Worse, this film's plot is convoluted and nonsensical. To add insult to injury, the terrible racist depictions of stereotypes are all over the place and its message of inclusivity and diversity are horribly forced and fake, to the point it comes off as insulting and degrading to the audiences' intelligence and minds.Third has to do with another questionable performance from Rebecca Ferguson whose portrayal of Jenny Lind whose character was considered to be as the ""Swedish Nightingale"", suffers a glaring issue within its characterization and its portrayal, particularly with the singing voice despite the fact that the singing voice was being dubbed by Loren Allred and not by Ferguson, who didn't commit herself to singing on her own and while her acting is still appreciated, the singing voice made it another additional problem for the film's historical inaccuracies.Fourth, despite its solid cinematography and choreography; the film really came out as style over substance (of which the style really comes off as ironically awful), favoring performances as well artful and artistic merits over story, depth and character development, making this film a flashy and a disappointing mess. Even the editing and the pacing made it more dreadfully convoluted, confusing and dull, as well as hard to watch, and not to mentioned that despite the film's intriguing costume and production design, its designs came off as unreal, awkward, cheap-looking and pantomime, and not in a good way. Another terrible thing would be that the CGI in the movie, is also terrible-looking, fake, and unconvincing .Lastly, what's so disappointing and perplexing is that the Pasek & Paul duo made a disappointing contribution to this film and not to mentioned that they've really dropped a ball on this movie with the songs and the music (following their great track record for La La Land) and much of these songs they've written in this movie (despite these songs were entertaining), really comes off as totally generic, bland, fake, forced, contrived, forgettable, and at worse, very terribly annoying. Even ""This is Me"" song is also considered as forgettable, forced, fake, overproduced, over-egged, stupid, and idiotic, despite the ironic fact that it's supposed to serve as an anthem for the prejudiced and disabled, which is just only seen as utterly laughable and cringeworthy.Clearly, The Greatest Showman is truly a dishonorable, disgraceful and terribly a laughing stock to the contribution of the revival of contemporary musical films and really an abominable travesty to the superior La La Land and other great musicals including Moulin Rouge!, Chicago, and Dreamgirls.With all these problems that's plaguing the film's quality, this film is definitely not recommended to be seen even if anyone loved this film's music and soundtrack but honestly speaking that The Greatest Showman in its soundtrack is considered the worst soundtrack being made in this decade.","

"shaneka_l","7 January 2021","I have never written a movie review before in my life but this movie truly deserves one, so here I am a year after the first time I saw it. I avoided this movie at first thinking it wouldn't be something I'd find interesting, even as family, friends and colleagues mentioned how good it was. I still didn't give it a chance. A movie night at a friend of mine finally opened my eyes to this wonderful musical! I loved every minute of it. There was no slow start, it was interesting from the very beginning. Absolutely incredible. The songs are fantastic aswell, currently listening to ""This Is Me"" as I write this. Give it a try if you haven't watched it, you won't regret it!","

"Zen-2-Zen","26 August 2018","Sooo producers started paying bots to post early praises by the pound ? Seriously ? :-))))) The ""industry"" has gotten THAT desperate ???? I had to sort by time since ""most helpful"" reviews looked so ridiculous. And then everything became clear.Musicals are usually stupid, pretty much by definition, but the genre manages do produce something good once in a decade. Needless to say that this thing is not in that group. One shouldn't expect anything from a flick that Zac Efron is attached to anyway. And that girl named ""Zendaya"" ?? They should do cartoons with them - to save on ink and labor for frame drawing :-)Hugh Jackman apparently got a water running through his ears after ""Les Misérables"" and ""conveniently forgot"" that Anne Hathaway actually carried that one on her back, together with several equally brilliant actors, and that he was really not much more that a furniture there. Or should we say mise en scène ? :-)Thank god for for the skip button.","

"mnshark12","28 July 2019","I originally was not overly excited about this movie. After hearing some strong recommendations from friends, I went to check it out and was so happy I made the trip. It is absolutely amazing. You feel such joy watching the quality and care that goes into every scene. I do have to say I am a huge fan of Broadway shows, if you are not or do not enjoy musicals, this is most likely not the movie for you. If you are, it is a must see.","

"Andres-Camara","2 May 2018","Ha habido películas que viéndolas me he dado cuenta que estaba bailando en el sillón, pero este no es el caso. La canción no tiene el gancho suficiente y es lo más importante de la película. 
Es entretenida, al menos eso si, por eso no la suspendo, pero nada más.
Es una película para pasar el rato, entretenerte, tampoco vas a alucinar con los espectáculos, porque no son la bomba.Los actores, normales, ni más ni menos.Sí que tiene una buena fotografía. Es bonita y agradable.La dirección deja mucho que desear. En este tipo de películas, tendríamos que haber visto unos planos espectaculares que nos habrían deleitado, pero no sabe hacerlo. Solo sabe observar la película. Tiene ritmo, sí, pero tampoco demasiado.Hay películas mucho mejores, que levantan más el ánimo y son más espectaculares.There have been films that watching them I realized that I was dancing in the armchair, but this is not the case. The song does not have enough hook and is the most important thing in the movie.
It's entertaining, at least that's the case, that's why I did not suspend it, but nothing more.
It's a movie to pass the time, entertain you, you're not going to hallucinate with the shows either, because they're not the bomb.The actors, normal, neither more nor less.Yes, he has a good photograph. It's pretty and nice.The address leaves a lot to be desired. In this type of film, we should have seen some spectacular plans that would have delighted us, but do not know how to do it. He only knows how to watch the movie. It has a rhythm, yes, but not too much.There are much better films, which raise the mood and are more spectacular.","

"Rayofsun71","25 April 2018","I'll say first that my taste in musicals isn't great. But seeing this I was surprised. I enjoyed every minute of the movie. All of my friends agreed on this one even though it was a bit late when we saw it that didn't stop us from enjoying it. We now own it and can enjoy it all over again. I recommend it to everyone. It will leave you amazed.","

"cmckeon-92223","4 August 2018","This is a over glamorized musical about accepting freaks. They focus on the daydream part instead of the realistic part of making money off of oddities. 
The main thing they ignored was the live animal acts and the abuse that continues of animals that is going on even today. 
Barnum just wanted a show where he could say ta da and make money.",NA
"CineMuseFilms","1 January 2018","If you were impressed with the opening number of La La Land (2017) you will find the start of The Greatest Showman (2017) more electrifying, with high-voltage music charging the entire film. But be warned: some will reject it for not being the original Barnum or because Hugh Jackman is not Michael Crawford or because the film plays loose with history. Ignore the naysayers: if you give in to it as pure entertainment, Showman is an original, vibrant, fast paced fantasy musical that raises the bar for the revival of this genre.In just two musical numbers, the poor boy, P.T. Barnum, meets the well-to-do love of his life Charity, and in a seamlessly compressed time capsule, they grow up, court, elope, start a family, and he sets up a theatre in New York. Barnum turns out to be a natural self-promoter and impresario. He gathers a cast of misfits and fringe-dwellers, including a bearded lady, a dwarf, a tattooed man, the world's fattest, tallest and strongest men; anyone who is different from society's definition of normal. Difference attracts hatred, and critics and protesters are part of Barnum's world, He strives for respectability by recruiting a prominent playwright and a world-class singer but suffers personal and financial setbacks that threaten the circus. Almost defeated by arson, he turns to the canvas tent and reinvents the modern-day circus. As each major scene segues into the next, it is carried forward with a musical number that weaves lyrics, rhythm, and melody to produce dramatic and emotional moments.It is hard to not be swept away by the pace of action, spectacle, and colours of circus life. Far from the vaudeville-inspired Barnum circus music of yesteryear, Showman has the dramatic percussive beats, harmonies, and video-clip choreography of contemporary musicals that reach a new generation. The instantaneous grabbing power of ""The Greatest Show"", the punch-the-air assertiveness of ""This is Me"", the haunting melodies in ""Never Enough"", ""Million Dreams"", and ""From Now On"", together with six other high-energy numbers create a soundscape that takes you beyond visual realism and into the realm of fantasy. Like all musicals, character and plot are only scaffolds for creating the bigger extravaganza of timeless 'showbiz'. The film's ensemble of diversity, dance, and vocal talent is perfectly matched to its objective of making you tap your feet and leaving you wanting more.More than any other film genre, the fantasy musical is best judged on its total entertainment effect. There are themes relating to the acceptance of social outliers, pride before the fall, and redemptive healing, but this is not a sermon nor is it a factual historical adaptation. If you need an overriding message, the film's theme song shouts unapologetic self-acceptance with ""no more hiding who I want to be...this is me"". Don't be distracted by the plasticity of personality and performance: that's part of all show business. Above all else, this film is fun, fast, and musically delightful. In today's world, we need more like this.",NA
"rishis-28921","14 February 2018","This review won't stop anyone seeing this movie but I'm gonna put it on here anyway. I'd read a lot of hype for this movie, mostly on IMDb and from friends, and really wanted to enjoy this. I did not. Minus points: The plot is so predictable I don't even have to spoil it for you: just watch the first ten minutes. I didn't care about any of the characters at all, and the director decided to give the (actually interesting and engaging) romance between two characters 1 out of the 11 songs and about 5 minutes of screen time. Most of the lines didn't make a shred of sense or were interrupted by random songs (which all sounded like trashy 2013 Top 40 chart fodder - absolutely insufferable) and the direction was awful. Plus points: Loved the dancing. The costumes/sets/makeup were good. The acting was alright. The cinematography was passable. The popcorn in the cinema was pretty decent.
If you enjoyed it, good for you. But I hope you can see my point of view on this.",NA
"ASuiGeneris","1 January 2018","The Greatest Showman (2017) Barnum was a fraud, 
But this film sugar coats that. 
Where were fact checkers? 
""Sucker born every minute""? 
This was no biography. Call me a sucker, 
Loved Barnums and Oddities. 
Entertained throughout. 
Clever choreography,
Catchy musical numbers. (Somonka is a form of poetry that is essentially two tanka poems, the second stanza a response to the first. Each stanza follows a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. Traditionally, each is a love letter. This form usually demands two authors, but it is possible to have a poet take on two personas. My somonka will be a love/hate letter to a film?) #Somonka #PoemReview",NA
"Khamsin_50","3 January 2020","This could've been a great movie, if not for concept. With all due respect to anyone loving musicals, and overly romanticized stories: This could've been a movie about struggle, about being human, about flaws and rising above them, about success and failure, about... So many things. But what it is - it's some producer's idea that ""we didn't have a musical in ages, this would be cool to produce as a musical"". And I don't care about people fainting over ""though guy can sing"" - everywhere where there could've been great writing, great acting and great character development - there's a song. And not a very good one. This is below mediocre, and it's 4/10 because camera, costumes and few other things are decent. Otherwise it'd be 1. Acting is found in traces here. This is not a movie, this is not a musical, this is waste of money.",NA

"volare12","3 January 2018","It's a bad sign when before a movie even starts, the star and director appear on screen and beg the audience to like their project, as Hugh Jackman and Michael Gracey do here. Uh, guys, maybe let the film speak for itself, like most filmmakers do? I find it funny how personally offended some people seem to get when critics slam a movie that they happen to like. Critics are entitled to their opinions, after all. And in the case of ""The Perfect Showman"", not all the critical reviews have been negative. However I would have to strongly agree with those that are. This movie has the seeds of some interesting ideas floating around in it, but it's ultimately very badly done. Even leaving aside the lack of factual accuracy in Barnum's story and taking it purely at face value as a piece of fantasy entertainment, it might have been good, IMO, if some actual craftsmanship had been employed. But almost nothing in ""The Perfect Showman"" works well. The story is simplistic, overly sentimental and devoid of any character depth or development. The look of the film is dark and ugly for the most part, and the musical numbers are shot like music videos, with rapid cuts and no sense of the storytelling continuity needed for effective musical theatre. The music production is terrible, with lyrics getting subsumed by loud orchestrations in the big production numbers, and so much processing done on the vocals that they sound distractingly artificial even though the actors, with one exception, are all doing their own singing. The setups for/transitions into songs are clumsy or nonexistent, and the songs themselves are tuneless, bland, anachronistic and forgettable pop-shlock, something which I have now come to expect from these songwriters. It pains me to write this because I know some of the people involved in the making of this movie, and because I am a big fan of musicals when they are well done. I knew next to nothing about ""The Greatest Showman"" going in, but given some of the people involved, it certainly seemed like a promising bet. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very disappointing overall. The three star rating is for the talented actors, who all come off well (Michelle Williams and Zac Efron in particular) and do an admirable job with the sub-par material they are given to work with. But despite their best efforts I found very little to enjoy in this movie, and it was almost impossible to sit through it from beginning to end.",NA
"starving_college_student","12 January 2019","Great music! Cool musical moments. But I really wish this movie wasn't based on a real person. If it were a pure fantasy, I could have gotten into this more. But knowing PT Barnum is who he is, I constantly wondered 'how did this event really happen.' Because the movie churns through scenes without developing characters or really showing you how Barnum got his ideas/became famous and instead flips the events into moments of fantasy. And that is the main problem - we don't get to know any of the characters particularly well (even Barnum). The script glosses over everything with pizzazz and spectacle but never lets the audience feel, understand or know why characters acted the way they did. Instead, it is a paint-by-numbers formula of every other musical you've ever seen, bringing nothing new to the mix (just a mishmash of cliches). I want to feel sad when the character loses something because I was along with the journey with them and understand their loss, or come to the conclusion that a character was truly motivated to be loved through the scenes and actions of the characters that I saw. Instead The Greatest Showman tells you 'this is the scene where you're supposed to cry' with its loud music and flash. So in an ironic way, this film is the perfect representation of Barnum's work/career - something of spectacle and no substance.",NA
"henrycoles9","1 April 2020","I loved the story and all the songs in this more than any other musical movie. They were so full of life and hope. Zendaya is such a great talent.",NA
"m-buckle","15 June 2019","White saviourship has never been so catchy!!!! Where to begin, when a musical about a slave owner who was abusive to his ""performers"" completely avoids any mention of any of the realities behind the actual historical figure... ok forgetting all of that, the songs are horrendous & the costumes are so poorly made, do not even get me started on those cheap wigs... you had vintage circus as a theme & you still managed to make it look hideous! Low hanging fruit! Good grief. I couldn't even stand seeing this till the end.",NA
"valgreet","3 February 2018","I did not enjoy this at all. I found the music to be generic, bland pop that sounded like it was created by a marketing department, in fact the whole movie seemed like a cheap, glittery plastic bauble from an arcade game. The songs were completely interchangeable and after awhile I cringed every time someone launched into song. There was absolutely no narrative; it seemed like a music video. There was a lot of talent but the characters were like stick figures, with no actual character development, and no motivation. There was not a genuinely creative moment in the whole movie. I started looking at my watch after about a half-hour hoping it would end soon.",NA
"adrian_wildsmith","30 December 2017","I don't like musicals! You know the ones where they sing/talk at the same time. Had I known this was a musical I would probably not booked a ticket. However it was a Christmas present for a dear friend of mine and her son so I was under contract! Being a bit of a romantic I was hoping it would be entertaining. I didn't expect too much and frankly was more interested in my vanilla ice cream coated in butterscotch sauce and topped with nuts. Suddenly I was a wash with the opening song. Before you could say popcorn I looked up from my tub of Ben and Jerry's and suddenly found myself totally taken by the young boy singing. That was probably at about one minute and five seconds into the movie. From then on I forgot I had an ice cream. I could hardly hold my breathe. So let's just say it's worth seeing. If you want to be lifted and inspired by heart tugging lyrics. Show stopping music and eye popping visuals then go and see this movie. I haven't left a movie with the feeling 'anything is possible' for a long time. I have had a few hard painful years recently, but this movie put a spring in my step. That's saying a lot. So yeah I would say it's very possibly 'The Greatest Show on Earth'. Anything that can make a person feel that good has to be worth talking about right? That's why I felt I had to write a review. After all isn't that why we go to the movies? To be entertained? To allow others to lift us from the mundane up to the stars! Do yourself a favour go and see it.",NA
