"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Chrysanthepop","29 October 2007","Mr. Bean is back and he's going to France on a holiday adventure. It's great to see Rowan Atkinson back on the big screen after a long time. I think the last time I saw him on screen was in 'Love Actually' (not so-great film but Atkinson was awesome). And of course, he's playing the character he immortalized, the goofy Mr. Bean. There are several Beanish slapstick moments set throughout the dazzling spectacular French locations. Beam also befriends a young Russian, Stepan and a French actress, Sabine. Together they share his adventures.Though the comedy itself doesn't rely on witty dialogues, there's plenty of fresh slapstick and silly moments that made me laugh. Of course, I enjoy Mr. Bean's sketches too so there is a chance that those who don't like him, might not enjoy the film. I found the characters quite lovable. Emma de Caunes as Sabine is charming and pretty and child actor Max Baldry as Stepan is impressive (unlike those annoying movie kids who 'beg' the audience to love them when getting on their nerve). But 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' clearly belongs to Atkinson. He's a wonderful comedian and it's great to seem him back as Mr. Bean.Cinematography and visuals do a great job by portraying the stunning locations of France. Yes, because of that the film is visually impressive too. The editing seems good enough but I found the ending to be slightly choppy.Having said all that, 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is much better than it's prequel. This one feels fresh and...well my summary pretty much says it all. A fun family film, especially if you like the Mr. Bean Sketches.","

It's hilarious, exciting, and it features one of the Rowan Atkinson's finest performances. One of my favorite comedies that I've seen.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Torgo_Approves","30 March 2007","Here's the deal: Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE has panned Mr. Bean's Holiday for being unfunny, a cow milked dry, same old same old, blah blah blah. Either these people just don't have a sense of humour, if I may be that harsh, or they didn't even see the flick and just reviewed it based on the weak trailer and their own false assumptions. I on the other hand have seen this movie and I can honestly say that it blew me away. It is not only about ten times better than its weak 1997 predecessor (which the film wisely ignores completely), it is a genuinely great movie. It's a feel-good movie which actually makes you feel good (!!) and never turns into awkward sappiness. It is also absolutely hilarious and, thank god, unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series.The basic story is that Mr. Bean wins a ticket to Cannes, where he accidentally separates a young boy from his father. Bean must help the kid find his father again. The plot is hardly the focus of the film, though - it's all about Bean and the often awkward, often painful, and always funny situations he gets himself into.Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best and I think it's about time he gets an Academy Award. No, I'm serious. If you think playing Mr. Bean is just a matter of goofing around and making stupid noises, I'd like to see you do it. Atkinson has developed this character to absolute perfection and is the only one who could possibly play the lovable idiot. The over-the-top body language, the facial expressions, and the convincing vibe you get from Bean that, well, the lights are on but there's nobody home - you can't bring all of this to a character if you're not a good actor. Rowan Atkinson is a genius and, like most comedians, he never gets the recognition he deserves.The supporting cast is good as well, especially Willem Dafoe as an art-house director with his head so far up his own ass and an ego so ridiculously huge he makes Roger Ebert look like Adam Sandler. But this is really Atkinson's show and he carries the entire movie, as expected. The sight gags and physical humour aren't exactly intellectual, but they are very funny and fresh most of the time and the comedy is, well, kind of classy. There's absolutely no toilet/gross-out humour (which I love, by the way), so it's really a mystery why the stuck-up critics disliked this as much as they did - assuming they even watched it. Although the humour is pretty ""safe"" most of the time, it never stops being funny and I can safely say that this is a film that the whole family can enjoy (and trust me, I don't often say that about movies - ""fun for the whole family"" usually translates to ""fun for the average two-year old, torture for the rest of humanity"" in my mind). It's not just kiddie stuff and the comedy is universal.It's a sweet, warm-hearted and very funny movie with a great soundtrack, good performances, a light plot, and a fantastic ending. Which leads me to the question: ""Did I and the critics watch the same movie?"" Perhaps Willem Dafoe's obnoxiously pretentious character hit just a little close to home for the snotty critics the film so obviously spoofed? They can have their ""Playback""-type films and gush praise over them all they want - I'd take this holiday over that any day.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","inkblot11","6 October 2007","Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) has just won a trip to the Riviera from his native England. He will be traveling by train, changing lines in Paris. Needless to say, he is very excited about his good fortune and has brought along a video camera to record his journeys. However, as he is taking a cab to the train station in Paris, he accidentally boards the wrong taxi and ends up on the other side of town. No problem, he'll just walk, as cars rush around him. Once at the correct station, he has some time to kill so he enters a posh restaurant. To his horror, he finds he has ordered oysters on the half shell and large crayfish. The food does not go down easy. After the meal, Bean is about to board the rails when he asks another gentleman to ""film"" his walk up the steps. Unfortunately, Bean causes the man to miss the same train, where the stranger's young son is deposited. Feeling responsible, Bean tries to care for the boy. But, what else could possibly go wrong? Plenty! The world owes Atkinson a big round of applause for his priceless character, Bean, and this film continues the fun. Although he rarely utters a syllable, Bean's facial expressions are worth a thousands words and his antics are very comical. In the restaurant scene, for example, his close encounter with the oysters are enough to send anyone into a frenzy of laughs. And, the giggles never stop but continue on until the film's end. Supporting him nicely are Willem Dafoe and the other unknown cast members, especially the young boy of the movie. The scenery of France is lovely while the costumes, direction, and script are first rate. With so few G-rated films on the market, don't miss out on this one if you are seeking a true family-oriented movie. But, in truth, don't miss this one for any reason, as Mr. Bean's Holiday is a welcome and humorous balm from life's proverbial bad days.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","john-quel","26 August 2007","This hasn't quite been the great year for movies that I had hoped for, but it has certainly been a very good year for comedies, and ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is the best so far. It is also quite a daring film -- who would have imagined a G-rated, live action comedy these days, and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. This movie homage, and I can it can be argued that it is, to the great Tati films of ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" is Rowan Atkinson's triumphant farewell to the great character he created. It is hard to imagine any other actor living today pulling this off. Indeed, ""Vacation"" comes very close to being a silent film -- though I want to assure anyone wandering in from a showing of Transformers, that there are explosion. Now over at the well-known movie review site, half the critics are complaining about Mr. Bean's mugging. Half the critics at that site will apparently complain about anything. But when you have a face as brilliantly expressive as Atkinson's, gosh people, you use it. To moan about that, well, it's like going to a Fred Astaire movie and complaining about the dancing.But more than that, every scene works, fast or slow, the pacing is perfect. Silly scenes or heartfelt, or both, the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes! There is also a lot of feeling here. I completely bought every one of the characters and their relationships. That is great comic writing.It also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not ""Mr. Bean's Vacation."" It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion, one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.I cannot recommend this movie enough, though I wish it had been longer. Take your family to see it -- it will be a long time before anyone can say that again about a contemporary comedy.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","witthayu","28 March 2007","I don't understand the bad comments here. I saw the movie just now at a press screening in Bangkok. I did not expect much (because I read the negative comments yesterday), but it was very good! It's not rocket science, it's just another Mr. Bean movie. I even thought this one was better than the first one, especially in the second half of the movie. The end was a bit over the top, but that's only for the last two minutes, you will see why.Willem Dafoe is also pretty funny as super ego movie director/actor and blends in well in the story with his 'replay' movie. Don't take life too serious and you will enjoy your time in the cinema watching Mr. Bean's Holiday!","

Theres no minute lost without something funny.is one of the few comedies that i never feel tired of watch, between the comedy, the music and the feel-good tone, you feel like this movie is a ode to the summer, cannes and musicals.The movie have every kind of joke you can expect, from the subtle to the direct joke.in many ways this is one of the best movies to watch in holidays because make you feel like you were in the trip having fun.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","SquirrelBot3000","18 May 2007","If you asked a handful of people of varying ages in America, chances are you'd get about 8 out of 10 knowing who he is. They may not know Rowan's real name, but they know the character.The sad part about this film is that it's absolutely wonderful, and most people in America aren't going to see it because it's rated ""PG"". Not a dirty gag, foul word, or joke about someone's junk to be found. And the really amazing part is that it's half comedy, half gorgeous scenery surrounding it. It mocks the Hollywood standard, it has melodious music, it's masterfully filmed, and all the while you just find yourself going ""Oh, that Bean."" *puts fists on hips*I can't honestly say I've seen a film this good, this funny, this... pure that can make anyone laugh and find themselves feeling charmed after having seen it. Emma De Caunes stole my heart, Max Baldry is a kid that anyone his age can relate to, and Defoe actually pulls out a great, over-the-top performance without even uttering a four-letter word that he's so very good at snarling out.You know what? Shame on us America. That we need the big bang, the flatulence, and the double entendre to amuse our soured idea of comedy. What is so wrong with having a character like Bean, a performance like Atkinson's, that we can't find that part of us that wasn't soured on tasteless ""humor"" but just absorb and let out a barrel-chested sigh of satisfaction after a hearty laugh from a genuine, clever clean joke or visual gag?We'll go on, with our Jackasses and Scary Movie XII and we'll forget about them five minutes after we've left the theater, but darnit, it's high time a movie like Mr. Bean's Holiday came along. And I for one would pay money to see this again, even if the American know-it-alls of Hollywood think it's better suited in a death slot in September, to be forgotten, sandwiched between sequel after sequel and the banality of teen slasher flicks acted by twenty-somethings whose genre should have died off years ago.If what Atkinson says is true, that this is the last time Bean will ever appear, then he's gone out on the highest note you could ever bestow on a character so beloved. Shine on Bean, and ride off into that sunset, you crazy, wonderful fella you. And thanks for all the laughs.... But where's Teddy?","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Drumski89","26 July 2007","Mr. Bean's Holdiay was a movie I really enjoyed. Mr. Bean was back in true form, and delivered an unexpectedly funny movie. Part of Mr. Bean's humor is when something is about to happen, you can see it from a mile away, and you yell at the screen ""look out Mr. Bean!"" or ""He left it on the counter! Oh No!"" or what have you. There is plenty of this,but there is also a great deal of irony and clever wordplay in it as well. It's a well rounded comedy movie, that will be funny to children and adults alike. I'm not really a big Mr. Bean fan, but I really liked this movie anyway, and I know that most people will too, if they give it a chance. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends, and to anyone who reads this review.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","planktonrules","3 July 2010","When this film began, I noticed a major problem at the beginning--and a problem that often plagues TV shows that are brought to the big screen. Instead of using the original writers who made the show so amazing, all-new writers were responsible for this film. Why idiots in charge of film companies do things like this is beyond me. So, from the outset, I was unimpressed and a bit baffled. I would have MUCH preferred to just see the simple sort of skits done the way they were so expertly done on the show--and the same problem existed with the first Bean film. No new locations, no guest stars to take away from the glory that is Bean and the same old writers that made it one of the best comedies in TV history.The film finds Mr. Bean winning a raffle which gave him a trip to Cannes. Along the way there, he naturally gets into various problems and leaves a wake of destruction. Ultimately, his weird ways result in a man missing his train--and his young son is stuck on the train to Cannes alone. Bean, in an unusual display of conscience (something he generally seems devoid of in the past), he decides to help the kid--though it took his missing a train to get him to do this. What makes this a little tougher is that the kid only speaks Russian.In many ways, this plot is rather reminiscent of the ""Mind the Baby Mr. Bean"" TV episode--though it throws in some pathos and schmaltz involving worried parents wondering about what has happened to their missing kid. Pathos is really something rather un-Bean like. Normally, the consequences of Bean's actions on others is rarely shown for more than a second or two--as people are usually more like objects in the show.Overall, it IS a decent film despite my being terribly disappointed in it. For people who never raw the original show, they'll probably like it a lot more than crazed folks like me who own DVDs of the original shows and think they are the greatest things on the planet! The main problem are that there's just too much plot in the film and the writing and pacing are wrong--making it enjoyable but a shadow of the original. On the plus side, the scenery in the film is nice and it does make you want to visit the French countryside. And, while it had almost nothing to do with Bean, I really liked the self-absorbed director's film (Willem Defoe) BEFORE Bean got a hold of it--it was a wonderful commentary on some film makers and it makes you wonder who they might have been parodying.","

From beginning to end it is a very sweet and warm hearted film! It is a great film for kids and adults! I only hope that Rowan will revisit this character again! We need more Mr. Beam! The acting is perfect a way above many comedians! Clearly we can notice the inspiration from ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday (USA)""All the supporting actors are very good, it is just a very well cast film with great soundtrack! Also Willem Dafoe is great as the obnoxious pretentious art-film director So please Rowan don't do the same that the main character do in Sullivan's Travels (1941). WE NEED MR. BEAN!!!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","studioAT","10 September 2010","If this truly is Mr Beans last adventure then I think we can only salute Rowan Atkinson and the writing team as the iconic character truly goes out with a bang.Stripping back all the Americanisms that were clear for all to see in the first film Mr Beans Holiday goes back to basics by having a simple story that allows the character and Atkinsons talents to be on full show. With the beautiful French backdrop this is a fast moving film that has a lot of heart and humour. Dafoes cameo isn't great but it doesn't matter because Atkinsons bumbling Bean more than makes up for it with some great comedic moments throughout.So long Bean, it's been a blast.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","simonparker1990","25 March 2007","Rowan Atkinson had disappeared off our screens for a little while. After the critical mauling of Johnny English he sort of vanished into thin air for a while. Personally I can never understand why the critics savaged Johnny English as much as they did, sure it was flawed but it was pretty funny. Now, however Rowan Atkinson has returned, and he's brought along his most well loved character to date. Mr Bean is back, ladies and gentlemen! Now for some people this will cause great excitement, for others it will cause them to groan very loudly. You see Mr Bean is an acquired taste, and after seeing this movie I can still very much say that Mr Bean is an acquired taste. If you dislike Mr Bean in the first place the odds are extremely high that you will hate his latest outing. I on the other hand really like Mr Bean, not love, but I enjoy his sketches and the last movie was pretty funny. This movie in my eyes is a bit better despite still being overly sentimental and some comedy moments feeling a bit too forced. But this is a movie of small pleasures, this doesn't deliver witty comedy, in fact a lot of humour relies on either slapstick or embarrassing situations, yet the comedy still feels fresh and you can't help but enjoy it all along.The first thing I'll mention is the actual storyline and the actual comedy of the movie. The storyline here works a lot better than it did in the first Bean movie. It seems more natural and like a proper Bean movie, not committee driven like the first movie seemed. The story involves Bean winning a raffle and going off on a holiday to France. It's a simple story and won't be winning any awards, but its what happens along the way that makes the movie so much fun. The comedy here ranges from pretty small laughs, such as the tie getting caught in the baguette machine, to absolutely hysterical sequences which involves Mr Bean trying to earn some money. And the comedy works like that throughout, its always making you smile, whether it be small little sequences that make you smile to yourself, or whether you're practically rolling in the aisles, this is a feel good movie and proud of it.Nevertheless, the fact it is a feel good movie is also the movies largest downfall. The original Bean movie had huge problems because it was overly sentimental, unfortunately it seems like they haven't learnt their lessons with this movie. Sure it starts out hilarious, but the sentimentality begins to kick in around the halfway mark, and sometimes it is unbearably sickly that you can't help but want to heave. Of course this is a kids movie so I can't be overly critical with the sentimentality. But I would have preferred it to have had a little less of it. We want to see Bean in funny situations, not in a situation that tries to be heartwarming yet feels oddly misplaced. My other moan goes with the ending, it seems rather abrupt and also a tad sickly. The sickliness of it goes with my last complaint. But the ending after a bit of a lead up just suddenly jumps on you and its over. I was the only out of the group I saw it with who felt this, so perhaps that is just my feelings, but in my eyes I wanted a more spread out ending.The performances of the movie are up to a pretty high standard. Atkinson doing his traditional Mr Bean routine, it doesn't feel old in the movie and it still proves that the character is pretty funny. Willem Dafoe pops along for a great role, and the actual child actor of the movie was surprisingly not irritating like a lot of child actors out there. Overall Mr Bean's Holiday is a great family movie that will keep the kids in hysterics and the adults very happy as well. Its not going to amaze people, but in terms of fun this movie should be a family favourite.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","denis888","10 June 2007","Mr. Bean, or Rowan Atkisnon, may seem one dimensional man, but here he is impeccable. He plays with a real gusto and his gags are great.Any time he does a gig, that is really funny/ His trip to Cannes is a real gem of laughs - he separates the son of a Russian film maker, he forgets his passport, he loses his money and tickets, he only managed to keep his video camera and make his documentary. Who is really great here is Willem Defoe as a bombastic film maker who loves himself so much that he makes stupid, silly films that make people sleep. Watch it for fun, for real relaxation, for real great time. Mr. Bean is not a serious masterpiece of cinema, but he is fresh, upbeat and this longer film is a great insight into a rural France, as well as bigger Paris and glamor Cannes.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","ccthemovieman-1","1 December 2007","Well, overall I'd say that I enjoyed this movie and got enough laughs out of it to make it worthwhile, but I wouldn't watch it again. I think you can only take so much of Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean."" A newcomer to him (believe-it-or-not), I found him a lot of fun in the first half of the film but, boy, this guy is tough to take in longer dosages. I wonder if others feel that way?It's weird; the film was entertaining.....but I found myself looking at my watch a lot during the last 20 minutes, hoping it would end. Maybe breaking the film into two viewings would have helped. Atkinson's goofy faces are very funny at first but get tiresome after an hour.Well, it was a ""cute"" story, anyway, and certainly one the whole family could watch. There is nothing, language or sex-wise, that would offend anyone. This is just old-fashioned, almost silent-film-type slapstick comedy. ""Mr. Bean"" certainly is a likable guy, as are the co- stars, Emma De Caunes and young ------ . Actually I probably laughed more at the ultra- corny lines delivered by Willem Dafoe, whose character pokes fun at film makers. How Dafoe uttered some of these lines with a straight face is beyond me!The film, though, belongs to Atkinson who is in about every scene and hams it up to the max. If you laugh at his contorted facial expressions and limber body (check out his karaoke work!), you'll love the film. It's very lighthearted comedy and I wouldn't knock the innocence of it, but it's difficult to take in one dose.Overall: recommended because this is one of the few comedies of recent times you can actually watch with your kids and not worry about anything offensive. For that, it deserves some accolades.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","soutrik-93","27 August 2007","What I absolutely don't understand is what part of this movie people weren't satisfied with. If you aren't a Bean fan, then you obviously shouldn't watch this movie. With Mr. Bean, you either love him or you hate him, there is no middle ground, so you should know whether or not this movie will be worth your cash and your time. Like some people before me have stated, people who don't like this movie should check out ""The Playback"" by Carson Clay. Unlike the last Bean movie, there is no moral yarn embedded in this story, just pure, unadulterated Mr. Bean comedy. This includes disasters that he unwittingly causes, and ones that he causes deliberately. Best of all, all the humor in this movie is new: you have not seen it on the show. Basically, watching this movie is like watching a one and a half hour episode of the show, only better. Better because the humor is high budget. Better because there are recurring gags in the film, such as him saying ""gracias"" while thinking that he's speaking French. But most of all, better because this time there is also a plot. You find yourself cheering on Mr. Bean. For the first time, we can really connect with Atkinson's character. So did this movie pass my requirements of becoming ""great""? Definitely, it passed with flying colors.","

Like the first movie, it was an huge international success as well. But this sequel is lighter, less crude and less mean-spirited as well. Which the sequel is aimed more at kids, since the sequel is a ""G"" Rated Movie comparing to the ""PG-13"" original. Atkinson is a joy as usual by playing Mr. Bean. Which ""Bean"" character is based on a successful international t.v. show. It was also an brief animated series as well. This will be probably the last time that Atkinson will play ""Bean"" on any form. This has some big genuine laughs and as well movie within movie scene with Willem Dafoe. Which is an fictional movie playing at the Cannes Film Festival is hilariously pretentious and also the highlight of this long-awaited sequel. This sequel is the funniest, lightest comedy of this year. Don't miss it. (****/*****).","

Along the way he has encounters with a lost Russian boy : Baldry , an aspiring actress : Emma de Caunes, and an egomaniac filmmaker : William Defoe, all en route to the Cannes Film Festival.It is a fun set-up with plenty of room of hilarious set pieces, including ridiculous situations, continuous jokes and absurd humor.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","aharmas","20 August 2007","Mr. Bean returns with more of his absurd and mind blowing antics, a character who lives in his own universe unaware of the consequences of his actions, sometimes puzzling the audience because we can't understand if this all a result of pure innocence or blatant stupidity, and this is what makes Bean's appeal so universal. It's hard to peg him because we see a bit of ourselves in his manic behavior. Shouldn't we forgive ourselves if we made mistakes? In addition, Bean makes it very clear that there is more substance to his character than the obvious broad comedy. In ""Bean's Holiday"", there are two moments where the film transcends what we have seen Bean do before: a scene where Bean accidentally separates a father and his son and incurs the wrath of everyone else on the train, and later on, when his crazy actions captivate an audience. Atkinson has perfected his techniques and he has managed to give us sublime moments.He has now taken comedy to heights very few funny man have been able to do. It recalls ""Young Frankestein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" because it blurs the borders between the pathetic and the glorious. It presents very clearly the links between comedy and tragedy. Bean's odyssey takes him through highs and lows, and we laugh and feel as he must find ways to survive and keep going. His character is appreciative of those moments when relief comes, and we are now able to see how Bean is a full character.There is also a sense of realism in the movie that is rarely present in comedy. We feel the exhilaration of his job at being on vacation. We understand the not-so-subtle differences between French and the British, and there is the beauty of the cities and the countryside, the egocentric attitude of some in the movie industry. ""Bean's Holiday"" is quite an achievement, a not so quiet exploration of what the world is like as seen through the eyes of one rather special human being.There is plenty to enjoy here, and it will leave you with a smile on your face.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","ninjagaiden007","31 March 2007","Mr Bean is back and is again going to be causing more disaster! Rowan Atkinson still plays the part tremendously. 19 years later and is still playing the same guy. Rowan Atkinson just never seems to want to get old. He still looks young and as fit as anything. Rowan Atkinson does his stunts in this movie too. The acting is somewhat good. What this movie tends to do is not be funny for 5 minutes and then they throw in a laugh out loud joke. It doesn't seem to fail once. This film is a movie for everyone of all ages. All the kids and adults were laughing all the way through it. Don't believe all the critics or haters. It's exactly the same with Meet The Fockers. Whenever there's a comedy sequel people bash it, and guess what? They haven't seen it or all of it. So ignore the haters and enjoy a laugh out loud joke every 5 minutes or so.","

I don't remember too much from this feature, but I can attest that it was very entertaining and enjoyable when I watched it.As the IMDb plot outline puts it, Mr. Bean (Roman Atkinson) wins a trip to Cannes, where he separates a young boy from his father, unintentionally. Therefore, he must reunite the two, while also engaged in an adventurous journey of heading to the Cannes Film Festival.This film has a lot of slapstick humor, but tasteful enough that in a way it does not get borderline annoying and over-the-top. It's great fun and I would certainly recommend this film to any comedy lovers.Grade B+","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","tieman64","22 July 2012","""Mr Bean's Holiday"" stars Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean, a cross between a legume, paedophile, extraterrestrial and Down Syndrome baby. The film's a love-letter to Jacques Tati, the French silent-comedian renowned for creating the socially inept lead character, Monsieur Hulot. Atkinson's Bean is modelled on Hulot, and ""Mr Bean's Holiday"" is itself a giant ode to Tati's filmography, particularly ""Mon Uncle"", ""Playtime"" and ""Mr Hulot's Holiday"".Directed by an otherwise undistinguished Steve Bendelack, the film – quite unusual for our times – largely plays like a silent comedy (Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton etc), its jokes visual, physical and wordless. Bendelack's cinematography recalls late Tati, with urban centres resemblant of the banal futurescapes of Tati's ""Playtime"", and beautiful French beaches, countrysides, fields, towns and skylines, all of which recall Tati's work in ""Uncle"" and ""Holiday"". Throw in the beautiful Emma de Caune and you have a film which looks like an idyllic travel brochure, Bendelack's colours super-saturated, bright and cheerful. Complementing these eyeball zapping images is a soundtrack packed with catchy Bal-musette (French accordion or café music). It's the kind of film you watch wearing swimming trunks.The film was poorly received - probably because it sacrifices humour for technique and much canned charm/affection - but is loved by kids and is one of the better live-action family films released in recent years. See too ""Fly Away Home"". ""The Illusionist"" would be released in 2010, based on a previously unproduced Jacques Tati script.8/10 - Worth two viewings.","

Instead of crazy laughs per minute (as in Bean and the earlier Mr. Bean TV episodes), this is a road trip movie with some gaps in the action. There are laughs but some of the scenes are more clever than hysterical. Nothing however can take away from the joy of sharing in Mr. Bean's exploits as he tries to reach his simple goal, a holiday at the beach. Everyone left the film with huge smiles and several had tears of happiness (not tears of uncontrollable laughter). If you want to see a happiness inducing pick me up movie then this is one of the best around.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","nicholas.rhodes","19 April 2007","I am very sensitive to Mr Bean's humour and possess DVD's of all his series and film. This new work turned out to be even better than my expectations. Indeed the more of the film you see, the better it gets and the ""finale"" is very memorable indeed. In the latter half we experience extra emotions through the Interplay between Bean, Max Baldry and Emma de Caunes. These two latter are both very attractive characters physically and character-wise. These characters lend a tenderness to the film which we did not see in the first Bean film, the limit of which was Beans antics alone. Of course in Mr Bean's Holiday, we see recurring themes from previous Bean programs, such as the pieces of paper stuck on tongue and eyelids etc etc. Also, I thought that Bean's intervention replacing the thoroughly soporific film being shown to the audience in Cannes with his own video was excellent. On paper it sounds stupid but in practice the effect is excellent. When you exit the cinema after seeing this film you feel really good. I won't enumerate all the funniest bits as it is better to discover them when you see the film. Needless to say there are some wonderful views of France, of towns and cities we don't often see such as Cavaillon and Avignon, not forgetting the Pont du Gard and the recently opened Millau Viaduct which is a genuine feat of civil engineering and a tourist attraction in itself. We are also treated to the interior of the ""Train Bleu"" restaurant in the Gare de Lyon in Paris, as well as the ""Arche de la Defense"" in Western Paris where Bean ends up after having been misdirected. It's a shame that this is apparently Bean's last film as I never tire of seeing this character however often I see him. I can imagine him not appealing to everyone but that said, his humour is SO universal, that it breaks language barriers and is appreciated in over NINETY different countries round the world. No other comedian today can manage this, and another important thing is that Bean appeals to all ages, old and young, children and adults. This sort of thing impresses me very much as there are little unifying forces in the world today. I try to imagine an audience composed of people from all over the world watching a Bean film and can see them all laughing their heads off. What a relief and how refreshing to see a film that is entertaining but does not rely on violence, sex and special effects. This film will doubtless furnish 90 minutes of pleasure, tenderness and relaxation to millions across the world and for this reason alone, I deem it fully worthy of my praise.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","GusherPop","9 December 2021","They're saying this is Mr Bean's last appearance, but if Rowan Atkinson hasn't got the heart to kill off the character, I'll gladly throttle him by his necktie myself. In a post-Borat world, surely there's no place for Bean's antiquated fusion of Jacques Tati, Pee-Wee Herman and John Major? Perhaps he's a version of British masculinity the rest of the world can relate to. Anyway, here he is again, and after a quick set-up in which he wins a holiday in France and a video camera, he's off gurning, mumbling and generally making irritatingly exaggerated movements like a mime who hasn't noticed he's working with props. There are innumerable set pieces, most of which take an awfully long time to deliver an awfully weak gag. And worse still, Bean gets a sort-of love interest in the form of the delightful but clearly undiscerning Emma de Caunes, who gives him a lift to the Cannes film festival. There, with thudding predictability, Bean hijacks the screening of a film by a pretentious American director, played by Willem Dafoe. With ""Mr. Bean's Holiday,"" the British comedian Rowan Atkinson continues a tradition that in the right hands - Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati, even Jerry Lewis in ""The Bellboy"" - never gets stale: comic pantomime. Or, in this case, near-pantomime, since Mr. Atkinson, in a sequel 10 years after ""Bean,"" speaks, but only rarely. He doesn't have to. His googly eyes, gangly physique and elastic countenance are just fine for delivering the goods. As the clumsy, sometimes mischievous but mostly well-intentioned title character, Mr. Atkinson essentially plays a child (in grown-up attire), which is only proper, given the audience this movie is squarely directed at. Yes, there are subtitles involved, but so what? The kids at my screening loved it. Besides, at its heart, Mr. Atkinson's movie, a huge hit overseas, speaks in an international language. The plot is simplicity itself: Mr. Bean wins a ticket to the South of France; train-station confusion results in the separation of a boy and his father; and it's up to Mr. Bean to reunite them. But not before he has demonstrated the range of his slapstick, against a sun-drenched, candy-colored French countryside. The whole escapade ends up at the Cannes Film Festival, where Willem Dafoe does an amusing turn as a vain director.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","MUFCOK","12 July 2014","I really don't understand all the negative reviews and bad comments on here regarding this movie. I don't know what people expect, it is just another Bean movie! Rowan Atkinson plays Bean as he has done for the past 20 years or so. Over the years Rowan Atkinson has perfected Mr Bean and makes playing that role seem like a walk in the park. Mr Beans Holiday certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard! The story is simple, Mr Bean wins a trip to France in a raffle. His simple goal is - Get to the beach, but as you can imagine, for Mr Bean it is not that simple! From the moment he steps on the train to begin his journey the classic Bean antics begin! This movie throws up many, many laugh out loud moments but does not stray far from the story and it keeps on track and moves along at a nice pace.Overall this movie is a warm hearted, feel good movie which is certainly worth a watch if you enjoyed any previous Mr Bean shows/movies.8/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","tfrizzell","27 December 2007","The outlandish titled character (Rowan Atkinson) returns after a 10-year hiatus for this laugh-out-loud comedy. This time our hero wins a ticket to Cannes in France. Just wanting to go to the beach, Atkinson is totally oblivious of the International Film Festival that is taking place there. Thus there are crazy circumstances aplenty with a lovely French actress (the illuminating Emma de Caunes), a pompous American superstar (played superbly by the Willem Dafoe), and a young boy (Max Baldry) who Atkinson unwittingly separated from his parents. ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is one of the best fair films I have ever seen. I really like the movie, but I am a fan of the character Atkinson portrays so well and also of the original television series from Britain which ran sporadically in the late-1980s and early-1990s. With all this said, typical audiences could get little to nothing out of a production like this. Much like ""Bean"" way back in 1997, the tone is uneven and the translation from television to cinema is hit and miss at best. I like ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", but critically I would be lying if I said it is better than average. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","MarkLynnIreland1294","3 December 2021","I forgot when I first seen this movie yet it was on a DVD and certainly liked it more than previous '97 Bean movie.Quite like the Mr. Bean series, it brings bit of nostalgia to me, reminds me of Castlebar town (feels like my hometown), as well as my school trip to Paris (part of French class, see Parisian scenery). Speaking of the series, movie has continuity and similarities like Mr. Bean disliking seafood platter after what happened he had with rotten oysters in the Queens hotel episode. And some other episode he hides food in a lady's handbag near him.More better comical moments in this movie, Bean usually says misinterprets French and Spanish ""Gracias"". Ticket lady caught him with another man in train's lavatory. Bean's companion Teddy not shown doesn't bother me.Bit unnecessary with the suicidal man jumping from some aqueduct. Also Bean keeps losing his things like missed his train as carelessly his tie got stuck in the vending machine, then his suitcase, then his wallet/ticket/passport whatever was left on top of telephone booth he fainted in horror I sort felt the same.Great soundtracks like ""La Mer"" by Charles Trenet and ""Crash"" by Matt Willis (perfectly played when Bean stole bicycle and chasing the hen with his bus ticket stuck to its foot).Quite a cast as well: got usual beloved Rowan Atkinson (doesn't make Mr. Bean as an annoying obnoxious idiot in this film), Emma de Caunes is certainly pretty and attractive - more than Bean's previous girlfriend Irma (Matilda Ziegler) new potential girlfriend, boy Stephan is quite an additional, nice bonding moments of him and Bean; just like with Kevin Langley in '97 film. Actor Maxim Baldry just recently realised he was Liam Donovan in Hollyoaks - certainly like his younger self. And Willem Dafoe as antagonist film maker Carson Clay - believed he was alongside Sandra Bullock in disappointing Speed 2: Cruise Control.Overall, one of my favourite movies, sequels etc.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","powerfull_jedi","17 April 2007","I saw this movie last Saturday and I was pretty impressed at it. Mr. Bean's Holiday follows the exploits of our Britain's most bumbling gentleman who travels to France after winning a free trip to Cannes in the lottery. It quickly takes a wrong turn(for the amusing, obviously), when he has to escort a boy who lost his father in the train station who happens to also be going to Cannes. As far as the plot goes, it could be considered a 3-parter in the regular TV show, but with decent production values. I think it's a funny movie that barely resorts to toilet humor and uses somewhat clever and some tried-and-true gags. At first, it wasn't that funny, the early gags in the movie were barely worth a chuckle, but then things just got better and better. Rest assured,though, fellow Europeans, that the french(nor the Russians) are not ridiculed and stereotyped like in ,say, Eurotrip. Rowan Atkinson continues his best in portraying this amusing character and Willem Dafoe plays nicely the role of an self-centered actor/director. All in all, it's a worthwhile movie, Bean fans will get their fix, others are welcomed to see it.","

It's pretty rare that a movie comes along that simply exists to be silly, entertaining, and a real pick me up, but this movie hits all three marks. It was absolutely wonderful, and I am very glad that I saw it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mr Bean or just great side splitting comedy in general.

It seems that Rowan has taken bean to a new emotional level resembling classic silent artists such as Keaton and at times Chaplin, some scenes seem very reminiscent of ""the kid"" and help keep peoples attention to the story, not just Beans funny movements, though at times it drags slightly. There are of course aspects which have been included to accommodate an international audience but that is expected. In an effort not to give any of the film away and there's little dialogue to quote all I can say is that I enjoyed the film and felt that this is the Bean i saw as a child and Rowans ability to emote with facial expression alone should place him amongst the greats in silent entertainment.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","The_Light_Triton","2 March 2008","Mr. Atkinson deserves a huge round of applause for the 18 years he's played as his Mr. bean character. since 1989, he's starred as the dim-witted Mr. bean, who comes up with the most unorthodox ways to solve his problems. and this movie certainly shows that. While i don't usually praise comedies, this one certainly deserves praise. not because it was more funny than some of the trashy, simple sex and toilet humor comedy we witness in today's theaters, it was because Mr. Atkinson, a comedy legend, was portraying the character the whole world knows and loves to see.Mr. bean enters a raffle and wins a trip to Cannes, France (topless beaches! yay!) but as always, things go wrong, and unlike half an hour, it takes bean 3 times that to bring a young boy back to his father, a young, beautiful woman to her movie premiere, and get to the beach.I've always been a fan of Mr. bean ever since i first watched him, way back in 1997, just before the first movie came out. the TV series on CBC is what got me hooked. Mr. Bean is still funny even though i've seen him do his funny faces and crazy antics for over 10 years. but despite the fact we are saying goodbye to such a great character, Mr. Atkinson, the guy who made bean, deserves it. he doesn't shove dirty humor into people's faces like some of the modern trash we claim is funny, and that can be hard considering he's British, and most British comedy is usually rude. he's a very funny guy, and even if he isn't playing the character of bean, we can still see him making the same funny faces and clean humor through different characters.Thank you, Mr Atkinson.10/10","

I liked the fact that even though Mr. Bean is pretty much a child himself, he takes it upon himself to reunite a child with his father. He's so different from the animated Mr. Bean (I watched the animated series first).I liked that Mr. Bean didn't know he was in the middle of a commercial shoot and ""saves"" a woman, thinking she might be blown up. She ends up becoming friends with Mr. Bean, which is nice.Overall, it was heartwarming viewing this movie. It shows that Mr. Bean always means well even though he may show a bit of a selfish side. In fact, it WAS his fault that the boy got separated, but though he doesn't realize his mistake, he ends up reuniting the boy with his father at a movie premiere.In conclusion, I rate this 11 out of 10 stars.","

He's oblivious to his surroundings but he cares for people. Although the laughs keep coming throughout, the funniest bit has Bean lip-syncing opera as a street musician.

I wasn't too impressed with this but fair is fair! I couldn't remember much of the first film but wasn't expecting to be blown away or enjoy it to be frank! However i was pleasantly surprised and am not ashamed to admit i enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, this is no classic but it is a enjoyable film. The first thing i liked was the fact it wasn't set in America, so i didn't have to listen to a number of Americans try to explain who this Mr Bean character was! I didn't laugh out loud, but I did chuckle along at the jokes and enjoyed some of the darker aspects such as the mobile phone gags! When i saw Karel Roden pop up early on in the film i chuckled to myself as he filmed the camcorder... thinking back to the film '15 minutes' (if you've seen it you'll understand what i mean) This helped me loosen up and allowed me to enjoy the film. Also loved the whole Carson Clay in love with himself film moment near the end.I loved Black Adder, but was only a Mr Bean fan when i was very young, as an adult i have to say i'd grown out of it! This however made me reminisce and remember how good a comedian Rowan Atkinson is! The director also deserves credit too, as he keeps this story nicely edited through-out and lets the adventure unfold at a nice pace. Mr Beans love interest also deserves credit for being very easy on the eye! I won't go on about this film much, but basically don't just cross it off as something you'll hate. This is a loving, nice, and light-hearted affair, though strange in places it fits itself as a film that is good enough to sit through and enjoy. So if it's a rainy day sit back, relax and watch! A basic film comedy for all the family!","

In this movie, Mr. Bean visits France and a lot of funny things happen to him. Some are predictable and some are not. The ones that are not will make you laugh out loud. If you've been reading the negative comments from other reviewers, ignore them. Go watch the movie, you won't regret it.I was actually sad when I read that this was going to be the last outing of Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean. Please Mr. Atkinson, if you read this, make another one! We all love Mr. Bean!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","guyfromjerzee","17 August 2007","If you were somewhat disappointed with ""Bean"" (as I was), don't let that scare you off. I was pleasantly surprised with this hilarious and delightful installment. Of course, I was a big fan of the TV show and I think this movie did a much better job at adapting the lovable character to the big screen. Bean goes through his usual witty antics, and to add to the fun the film actually has a decent plot. I truly cared for all the characters, and found myself totally engaged throughout this wild adventure. I don't want to give too much away, but the plot involves a French boy, who accidentally gets left behind by his father. Bean helps him on his quest to meet back up with his father in Cannes. I felt total sympathy for the kid and desperately wanted him to find his father. Not only is the film very funny, but it also has plenty of heart. Rowan Atkinson hasn't missed a beat, considering he did the show so long ago. When I found out Willem Dafoe was in the film, I figured he'd just be in a tiny cameo. But he plays a pretty significant role as a pretentious director/actor, and does a great job at poking fun at these snobby filmmakers who are totally full of themselves. Unlike ""Bean,"" this film doesn't have too much crude humor, so you can feel free to watch this with the whole family. It's a perfect feel-good comedy!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","rollercoastadriel","24 March 2007","It's Mr. Bean again and I really appreciate his effort. I think the movie isn't that bad, not as bad as people talk. There were so many scenes that I found really funny and entertaining. I love the fact that this one takes place in France and I get a chance to see the beauty of it. It's great I think. And yes Mr. Bean still shows his silliness in front of the screen.Personally I love this movie. It's funny and I would recommend this to watch this not alone but with the whole family since I think it's also a bit too childish. Ooh, maybe I enjoy it because I'm still a child. Hehehe...Still one of the funniest movie for the first quarter of 2007.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","GaryWang","15 September 2007","I award a ten to any film which is extremely good at what it does, and Rowan Atkinson's comedic brilliance succeeds here on every level. The wry dark humor of Black Adder and even his more broad efforts in the BBC series The Thin Blue Line have been reigned in, and what we have left is something which will please every generation of moviegoer, young and old alike. One sketch leads to another and yet there is a real story here comprising a beginning, middle and one of those old-fashioned endings in which the whole happy cast sings while looking into the camera lens. Atkinson is better than Chaplin at character improvisations--what an amazingly funny, expressive face from this Oxford-educated structural engineer, of all things! The film is brilliantly cast and his two principal co-stars are both headed for bigger things: Emma de Caunes is wholesomely sexy with one of the loveliest new faces to grace the screen in a long time, while Bean's foil, the boy on the train, is played to great effect by Preston Nyman, a young stand-up comic who is conspicuously at ease before the lens. This was my introduction to the Mr. Bean franchise, and I'm delighted with what I know lies in store for me.","

I and my  friend gave an applause when credit titles started.. and everybody in  the theater joined us. The local newspaper critic was there too and  mention about is on his analysis. It was a nice movie, however not as  good as the TV-series.  You can imagine how much I've been waiting for this next film. And was  it worth it? This movie made me happy. I recommend it to anybody who's  looking for a good hearted, funny movie and has enjoyed Mr Beans  adventures before. It's more like the TV-shows than the previous movie.  Less talk, more action.  With a Russian kid (Max Baldry), French girl (cute Emma de Caunes) and  British Mr Bean language barrier gives many jokes.  One thing was missing from this silver screen version however: it  didn't have the scene where Mr Bean destroys a laptop on a train.. it  was shown on a trailer. Shame, it gave me good laughs. I suppose it'll  come with DVD.","

Im very surprised at the amount of criticism it has been getting as throughout the movie i was in almost fits of laughter! This is a great comedy movie and Rowan Atkinson still has what it takes to prove you don't need guns, loads of cheesy jokes and gags, huge budgets and big names to make a great comedy/movie. Go see it and enjoy it :D! Also like to mention that Steve Bendalak of league of gentlemen fame has done a great job with this film! Its also much more amusing than the first Mr.Bean film which i thought was too.... American, the European settings of bean on holiday give it a more homely feel and provides much more laughs. 10/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","iztok-gartner-1","20 April 2007","I went to see the new Bean full of scepticism. As a viewer who doesn't laugh at funny faces, cheap clichés and grimasse, the things Rowan Atkinson is know for in his cult Bean TV series. But I was surprised. Pleasantly surprised. So surprised I fell in love with Mister Bean right from the start. From the first scene, where he locks up his legendary automobile and hits the jack pot with a trip to Cannes. The new Bean is not just Mister Bean from the television. The new Bean is a good, very funny and surprisingly charming, beautiful comedy. The material in which Hugh Grant could also be great in. The new Bean's got all the ingredients I had not expected. All the ingredients needed for a very good romantic comedy. Of course, the new Bean also has those typical Bean's tricks, all that crazy and simple Bean's goofiness, which have won the hearts of the audience all around the world. You can watch the new Bean like a Jacques Tati movie, like Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Louis de Funes comedy. Like a fresh mixture of all four of them. Like a movie which will take over your asses and hearts at the same time. And as a movie which we could easily and without any bad conscience proclaim a high quality comedy and give loud congratulations to Rowan Atkinson for a welcome change. For changing Mr Bean from an idiot to an idiot with a heart. Of course, the scenes with that slow motorcycle, beging for money on the train station, singing opera on the market and confussion at the Cannes film festival where Willem Dafoe is presenting his new art movie, will go down in movie history as a pure classic.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","nina_glyndwr","3 April 2007","I've just come back from watching this film in Germany. Germans to the left and back of me, a Chinese couple to the right and Russian and Spanish-speakers in the row in front and heaven knows how many other nationalities in the rest of the auditorium - but it was wonderful to hear so many nationalities all laugh together. Better than anything the UN could devise.Excellent film if you like the silent film comedians of ages past, a bit of mime, and social ineptitude. It's a bit of an old-fashioned movie.Mr Bean is rather socially incompetent but not without feeling. And his feelings are writ large across his face. He goes to the rescue of damsels in distress and lost boys. He takes delight in simple things and manages to come up with all sorts of solutions to sticky situations.I think everyone managed to recognise situations they've been in - the horror when faced with food you don't know how to eat.. especially in a posh restaurant, the missing of trains, linguistic misunderstandings.. the way you grasp at a couple of words and use them ad nausea in an effort to communicate with someone else.. just to show willing.It was good. And the scenery.. ahhhh the scenery. It was good to see that again, too.William Dafoe is also excellent for his role that pokes fun at actors and directors that take themselves too seriously and think they are 'artistic'.Max Baldry - the actor playing the young boy - is also excellent.I came out in excellent mood - and that was after a big bust-up with the boyfriend so that's saying something.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","wildanimals","4 April 2007","If you liked the TV series and the first Bean movie, you will most definitely enjoy this one. The plot, in a nutshell, is that Mr Bean wins a raffle, and his prize is a trip to Cannes in the south of France. But disaster ensues, and he ends up getting lost. All he wants to do is go to the beach, but he gets caught up in other people's problems - including a lost child.The acting is superb. Mr Bean stays in character, and is still funny - it doesn't grow old. All the other characters do a good job too. They speak several different languages so there's plenty of variety here. The storyline is wonderful too - and it doesn't shove too much detail into your face. Unlike the previous Bean movie, it is closer to the series because the plot is simpler. It is simple yet enjoyable. The comedy varies from simple chuckles to hysterical laughter, and there should be something for everyone.So, for my closing comment, it is simple enough for kids to understand, but enough plot and laughs to keep adults amused. There's something for everyone here.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","tnrcooper","5 March 2008","This is a very enjoyable, clever movie. In reading some of the comments, I've seen some comparisons to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin given Rowan Atkinson's vision as a performer, this is not surprising. Atkinson envisions a character-in Bean's case, a socially inept, essentially harmless man-and superimposes this personality onto other situations. This film is not the laugh-a-second, manic energy of the legendary television series, or the more contrived energy of Bean's 1997 eponymous film. This film is more leisurely than the series, which is appropriate for a film, as opposed to a 30 min. TV show (which the shows were, broadcast without commercials on BBC2 in the United Kingdom). The movie takes accurate, if innocuous, but always entertaining, shots, at Hollywood egos. The story follows Bean as he goes on vacation to France and miscommunication occurs, although the miscommunication is mitigated by the universality of Bean's awkward behavior. He is trying to get to Cannes for the famous film festival but he becomes unintentionally entangled with the young son of a prominent director (Willem Dafoe, having a great deal of fun poking fun at the oh-so-serious manner with which some Hollywood figures consider themselves) whose film is the main attraction at Cannes this year. In addition, he crosses paths with one of the stars of the film, Sabine (the lovely and charming Emma de Caunes). There are some great set pieces, typically Beanian embarrassing situations and sweet, kind-hearted humor. This film is not brain surgery. But it was largely missed amid the hype and bombast of ""event"" movies during the summer. That said, this film is much much funnier than most of those, and a nicer film.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","sinncross","11 April 2007","Throughout the time line of iconic comedy characters, few have had a successful transition from television to cinema, or vice versa, or even braved the journey. Rowan Atkinson goes to right the wrong of his first Mr Bean film, with a holiday in France.Upon winning a vacation trip to France, courtesy of a raffle, Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson), along with a camcorder, traverse by train though France, in hope of reaching the Riveria. After some difficulty with the French language, and oddball mistakes, Mr Bean meets up with 8 year old Stepan, who has had a mishap of his own and is looking for his father. Two becomes three when they meet up with an amateur film actress, Sabine, and they decide to head to the Cannes Film Festival.The story of Mr Bean's Holiday is expectedly simple and lighthearted. While a continuing journey, the story is effectively made up of situational skits. Thankfully these skits do bring their share of laughs, but there are problematic dead spots scattered between. Since the story is simple and not set for deep characterisation, these moments are off putting and only time wasters. Another aspect of the film is the sentimental overtones, which are extremely apparent in the final scene of the film. While obviously in running with the holiday theme and family orientation, this sentimentality is rather unbecoming of a Mr Bean title, and worst yet, his trusty teddy is not even brought along for the ride.And without teddy brings another slight problem with Mr Bean's Holiday. The humour is indeed very good, and similar to the television series for the most part, but there are various moments where you can feel the Mr Bean magic could have worked better. Luckily for all the inconsistent dead spots, and accompanying laughs, the film does reach a hilarious climax.Mr Bean returns with his usual antics, but there is nothing that will stop the entire family going to watch the film.Mr Bean's holiday never reaches it potential, but there are some shining moments worthy of the original television series. While wholesome clean fun, the sentimental flavour of the story only goes to numb its overall performance.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","toytrainbob","26 August 2007","Perhaps I come from another planet, but I didn't know much about Rowan Atchinson or ""Mr. Bean"" and wasn't anticipating much when attending this film. However, I was surprisingly entertained. This comedy was head and shoulders better than most and met the single requirement of this genre--it made me laugh out loud and often. Bravo Mr.Atchinson. The film holds your interest with charm and physical comedy. It has little dialog yet has little difficulty telling its story and the lack of meaningful conversation adds to the comic relief. The supporting cast is wonderful. Emma de Caunes and Max Baldry are just outright adorable in this film. Almost a throwback to the silent era, Atchinson is not afraid to share scenes with incredibly cute children or scene enhancing young beauties. W.C. Fields is grumbling in his grave. We laugh at his silliness and his slapstick--an art form which is seldom seen anymore. Yes, even a space alien could have watched this movie and laughed heartily (if he can laugh and if if he has a heart). Really a must see for the entire family...............","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Bosco-HK","29 July 2007","Rowan Atkinson has been Mr. Bean for more than ten years. He is truly a fascinating human being. He has a face that never seems to grow old in our minds, body and soul. He is a true delight and his facial expressions never stop making us choke up and laugh till our stomachs begin to hurt.Previously, I saw on the message boards regarding 'Teddy'. I thought that Teddy has made his appearance in another form. This time, 'He' is a human being. 'He' is a child. 'He' is Stepan (Max Baldry). I'm not sure if you can remember the times when Teddy would always be shaken by the waist crazily by Mr. Bean while bonding together before bedtime, or Teddy gets his neck slammed by the closing of a drawer, or Teddy getting his head cut off by a pair of scissors... -unless I'm just hallucinating or forgetting the actual details, but anyways-..This time round, Teddy gets his own style of revenge. 'Teddy' is now Stepan, whose father got stalled away and missed the train. This is just like Teddy being mistreated before bedtime or right when Mr. Bean wakes up. Mr. Bean gets the 'hello' in a different way, how does it feel to be slapped? Mr. Bean later is also accused of kidnapping and possible 'abuse' for certain kidnappers may inflict on their victims... like Mr. Bean did to Teddy, the mistreatment of 'Teddy' tells us that Mr. Bean has taken Teddy from another owner and playing with it for himself.Besides the talk on possible missing appearance of 'Teddy', I thought that Mr. Bean in this movie decided to take his form of 'I'll-always-have-my-way' to the next level. For example, long time ago in Mr. Bean's series, Mr. Bean would always crash away another person's car to get himself a parking spot, this time he did it without his car. The funny thing is two weeks ago, I went to Paris. I lived at a hotel near the Jardin du Luxembourg, in order to get to the nearest cinemas, I had to make lots of Left, Straight, and Right turns to reach my destination on foot. And of course to get back to the hotel, I would reverse the above directions. Traveling around Paris on foot is very easy. Mr. Bean took pretty much the same approach, however in his very own unique way. He made sure that his journey on foot is, as STRAIGHT as a ruler, toward his train station. It was pretty unnecessary to stay exactly on the magnetic direction to the final destination. Yes, he totally ignored traffic and walked thru' Avenue des Champs-Elysées and various restaurants with itchy hands to get his way. And mysteriously also how lucky everything stopped, to create a walk path for him too.Besides portraying Mr. Bean all the time as the ultimate funny character in all his movies, here introduced another form of humor that has been defined by early directors. Either early directors really do that for their own benefit or that it is just a myth. Carson Clay's (Willem Dafoe) 'Playback Time' began really funny. The escalator scene lasted probably over 10-15 minutes. The mistranslated summary speech before the movie began made everything and everyone totally interesting and interested. In the end, they were wrong, they were all yawning and falling asleep. Sabine was mad at the director's cutting of her scene in his movie, Mr. Bean decided, with his itchy hands, to interfere and switch the movie with his own video, perfectly along with the narration. Regarding the perfect timing, one part of his movie before this, was even better, the performance he pulled while trying to earn money as a beggar. Not to expose too much, he was really good at lip-syncing the entire piece.Rewinding further... the starting scene also shown as in the movie trailer... the ability of speaking all kinds of languages at its most basic level can be amusing, Mr. Bean plays a part in the language barrier process where he is really good with the two easiest words in French but end up thanking in Spanish because the pronunciation of 'Thank you' in Spanish is easier to master than in French -at least for voice projecting-.As for the other characters like Sabine (Emma de Caunes) and again the possible 'Teddy'-in-human-form, Stepan (Max Baldry), Emma is very good looking and played an extremely crucial role for Mr. Bean, it expresses the growth in time. As kids, we played with toys when we were young in or out of bed; over time, we have grown and we begin to build inter-relationships with others. Mr. Bean gets all excited when he met Sabine again, who happens to be driving a car, very much like his. Mr. Bean was so fascinated, it was as if he just woke up from a coma and saw his car once again. Stepan (Max), I believe is 'Teddy' in my mind because he is adorable. Max's style of frustration and handling things is seemingly close to how he has learned them all thru' living with Mr. Bean all those years. Stepan swears to relieve oneself. The duo, Mr. Bean and Stepan, is very much like the good old' Mr. Bean and Teddy. Sabine, an interesting character, who also happens to be a girl, has been portrayed as a young boy who finally has grown up and is now building an intimate relationship in real life.If this is truly Mr. Bean's last appearance, I will be disappointed because Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean can never be duplicated, it is a soul-bond adaptation in this era, Mr. Bean's humor is the living version of funny cartoons, it is very suitable for all ages. Mr. Bean is still ever so fit and good looking, even after ten years, I really hope that he will not leave us like this after a short stop.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","sddavis63","4 October 2008","I like the Mr. Bean TV show. It's one of those classic British comedies that are often outrageously funny, and for a half hour of entertainment Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean can sometimes have you rolling on the floor laughing at his exploits. Then came the movies. I saw ""Bean"" years ago and my memory is not a pleasant one. I had been told that ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" was a sort of return to Bean's British roots after that very American detour and gave it a try. Alas, it disappointed. Apparently what works brilliantly in half an hour can't be sustained through much more than that.The comedy is neither consistent enough nor outrageous enough to make this truly funny and parts of the routine get tiresome after a while. Yes, it's humorous (mildly) the first time Bean says ""Gracias"" to someone in France. By the tenth time it's not. The story around the boy Bean is trying to help get back to his father did nothing for me (and the boy himself was downright uninteresting). The only scene in the entire movie that really seemed like a return to the sheer fun of the TV show was Mr. Bean in the French restaurant trying desperately to find a way out of having to eat the seafood platter. That was funny. Beyond that none of it really appealed to me and I was bored through a good part of it. (I also want to know - what happened to Mr. Bean's teddy bear?) The restaurant scene was funny though. For that and a couple of other smiles along the way - 3/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","reviewerinoimdbino","29 November 2007","Who would think you could watch an amazing film like this and then find, gosh, that it has a G rating? Even Disney cartoons these days include untoward allusions. This movie has all the spunk and charm in the world, and absolutely nothing offensive. It really is for everyone.It helps a great deal, of course, that it gives prominent place to one of my all-time favorite songs, La Mar by Charles Trenet. (The whole soundtrack is full of great songs, I want to get the CD.) But this movie is so involving, you care so much about the characters. Who would think something with Mr. Bean could so draw you in? How does producer Tim Bevan keep coming up with great projects? And I'm so glad to see that Simon McBurney, one of my favorite actors, provided the story. I guess big kudos also go out to director Steve Bendelackit looks like this is his first major motion picture.I really wasn't expecting much of this. A family member brought home a DVD of this and a DVD of 'Waitress.' I watched 'Waitress' first because I figured it might have sad elements, and I wanted to leave Mr. Bean for later, because that would have to be 'light.' I didn't care much for the first Mr. Bean movie, didn't think it was very good, but you have to watch all of these, if only from a sense of duty, because Rowan Atkinson is undoubtedly a genius and Mr. Bean is a unique, amazing creation.But this movie was from beginning to end a real joy. It's so much inspired by all of those old French comedies and the work of Jacque Tati as Mr. Hulot, but it rises way, way above them. I have always disliked the films of Tati: the cold, icy satires on modern life, the over-rehearsed, over-analyzed nature of each movement, each shot. There are elements of wit, but it's like you're being dared to be so low, so uncouth as to dislike it, and the films are patronizing in their emulation of the old silent masters like Charlie Chaplin. 'Look how daring and intellectual we are, we're inspired by a comic everyman.' Every moment of this movie feels fresh and lived. It feels fresher than Tati, more like 'Le Million' by Rene Clair or 'Drole de Drame' starring the immortal Michel Simon.As the starlet Sabine, Emma de Caunes is the ideal ingénue, pretty and charming, très sympa.But the kid, played by Max Baldry, is a revelation. The movie is as indebted to him for its success as it is to Rowan Atkinson. He is so utterly believable as a Russian boy used to life in France. He is totally unpretentious. I think he will be a major star one day. He has to be.I can't of course spoil the ending for you, but the payoff is BIG, hugely big, and wonderfully emotionally satisfying. I watched it over and over again.You might not do that, but you will laugh and you will cry. I did.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","casey-99","27 August 2007","My husband and I took our two boys (ages 6 and 9) to this movie. We are avid Bean fans and have the DVD set that spans Atkinson's career as Mr. Bean. Is Mr. Bean's Holiday the greatest comedy ever? Probably not. However, as a parent I find it very difficult to take my boys to movies and this was one of the few times where I actually felt we were at a family picture. When was the last time a movie was rated G? My boys had a wonderful time watching the site gags, and they followed along with the subtitles, which I thought was good for them. My husband and I had a fun time and unlike many children's movies, there was no sarcastic attitude, which I find is so prevalent in films right now. Some people have cited that they felt Mr. Bean's relationship to a child in the movie was inappropriate, but I did not get that vibe from the film. Also, Atkinson has used children in his Bean skits for years, always with funny results. I think people may read too much into it. Remember, Bean is pretty much a boy himself. While I think an adult who has no familiarity with Bean may find it all rather ridiculous, this is good family fare that parents can feel comfortable with. As I tell my boys, sometimes it is just fun to be silly.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","DICK STEEL","2 April 2007","Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean first burst into mainstream TV prominence in this part of the world sometime in the early 90s, where half hour episodes containing skits of that famous character cut through all boundaries with its humour - by not having Mr Bean speak (or speak minimally, and when it doesn't matter), and set in simple, identifiable premises, he's able to reach out to all, regardless of language.It's been sometime since new material came out, and the TV episodes have been relegated help past time in waiting areas of clinics or government offices. The last big screen outing Mr Bean had, was quite painful to watch, and nothing good came out of it, especially that irritating movie theme song by Westlife which polluted the airwaves.So why did I subject myself to the follow up movie, and possible the last Mr Bean outing in Mr Bean's Holiday? For the hope that it can bring back fond memories experienced when the television skits worked, that we can see the nonsensical, anti-social Mr Bean in his rude glory. However, it was not to be.In summary, Mr Bean has won a local raffle, which sends him to Cannes for a holiday. In true Bean fashion, everything goes terribly wrong, no thanks to his own stupidity, and he spends more effort trying to make up for lost time in getting to the fabled beach holiday. If you really break it down, the movie contains a series of set pieces which are skits stitched together to form a feature length film. The same old bag of tricks are recycled, as you terribly need great patience to sit through yet another Mr Bean hopping tantrum.There are rare funny moments that you can count with one hand, but nothing genuine. Most attempts at laughter were pretty contrived. Perhaps the few scenes that were fun (not funny) was Willem Dafoe hamming it up as the self-indulgent writer-director-producer Carson Clay at the 59th Festival de CannesPopular characters have a shelf life. Mr Bean's probably up, and it's time to put the character to rest. No point flogging an old horse to make a quick buck.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","karthik-globalsoul","22 May 2007","Ever heard of the fairy tale  Jack and the Bean-stalk? This movie is not the adaptation that's for sure, but everyday Jack gets his own version of the magic bean-stalk with ""Mr.Bean's Holiday"".The magic is in the smile and that rollicking laughter that you won't be able to stop. You get giant sprouts of laughter, barring a slight grimace as you see Bean troubling himself to make you laugh and in the end, you just can't stop loving him. That makes one sweet recipe to be anybody's favorite movie Well, since I don't want to spill the ""beans"", I shall keep it short and sweet.Bean wins the raffles on a rainy day in June in London (makes you wonder about the timing of Wimbledon each year, doesn't it). The grand prize is an all expenses paid trip to Cannes in the French Riviera. He meets a colorful lot of people to make the trip eventful and memorable.Without any idea of the French language except ""oui"", ""non"" and ""gracias"" (which isn't even French!!), Bean steps on with the kind of humor that you can associate only with him. The facial expression combined with the body language that wins all our hearts is seen all over the movie.Willem Dafoe is at his best  after being the wily and wicked ""Goblin"" in Spiderman, he is seen in such a comical role that he delights and the part with his movie screening at Cannes is too good for words. Excellent actor, I must say, I am impressed! The movie is full of fun, some parts are a little rascally, but Willem Dafoe sets the pace going. The film finishes with a flourish, and a happy ending too.I personally have tremendous respect for Rowan Atkinson (yeah the real name of the man behind all the hard work), for his story is one of grit behind the glory. Hans Christian Andersen said at his deathbed that after he was dead, there should be a march with short steps. The short steps were for the tiny feet of the children that would follow the march. I am sure Mr.Bean has already accomplished that  I say this as I see my little cousins and nieces wait anxiously to see Bean one more time on Pogo, even though they have seen the same episode some 100 times.Yes, it is annoying sometimes to see a man look and act so stupid, but it is also lovable to see after a while. Moron or childish prankster  the argument continues, but Bean certainly is the best comedian around.Time to bring out the bean bag and watch this movie to laugh your brains out. Laughter therapy at its very best.In all, a total beanfeast! Or as the French would say  C'est bon! If you work out a rating for this movie, I would put it at 8/10.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","lastliberal","21 June 2008","I can only recall seeing Rowan Atkinson once before. He played the new vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral, my all-time favorite film. Since I am not French, I was not impressed, as he just seemed like a Jerry Lewis clone, and I never like Lewis.For that reason, I totally ignored this film until now. Boy, was I wrong. It started out as I expected, with Bean being just plain silly, but it slowly draws you in until you are totally mesmerized.It really took off when Max Baldry entered the picture. Although they could not communicate verbally, they hit it off and made an incredible team. When Emma de Caunes joined the duo, then the picture really started to pick up steam.The Cannes premiere was magnificent, and a genuine original thought. Willem Dafoe was perfect as the boring artist, whose work was perfected by Bean. And the ending! It was just magnificent.This was an enjoyable film all around, and I really hate slapstick. Kudos to the director and writers who put Atkinson's character in the right situation for a great movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Chris_Docker","30 March 2007","It must have been on a long-haul flight when the brilliance of Mr Bean, a character I had always hated, struck me with particular poignancy. I'd rather be asleep on a plane than trying to watch a movie. Tiny screens of dubious quality, frequent interruptions by English-is-not-my-first-language air-hostesses, and broken sleep cycles preventing perfect concentration. This is not how I like to be entertained. Even less when its one of my least favourite comedians. So imagine me, if you will, groggy eyed, jolted awake by passengers needing the loo, eyes involuntarily half-focused on antics of some man whose bodily contortions and facial expressions are without bounds. And it came to me. Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, all those silent greats. Sod the sense. Sod the language barriers. They were a delight merely to soak up on the visual retinas.For Mr Bean's second cinematic excursion, he goes on holiday. Nothing fancy. A trip to the Riviera he's won in a raffle. Video camera included. He has a fixed intention of paddling on the sunny beach, and sets off on Eurostar and Intercontinental. Many 'Mr Bean' -type misadventures on the way, of course. He loses his passport, his ticket, gets thrown off the train, busks in a local market, wanders onto a film set, gets a lift from a minor actress, is hunted as a criminal, and turns a flop at Cannes into a major success. And gets to go paddling.Each scene lasts only a few minutes and is largely self-contained. ""It was always a slight source of regret to me that Mr Bean spoke as much as he did in the first film,"" says Atkinson. ""By putting Mr Bean in an environment where he doesn't speak the language he would have to deal with every situation in a silent way, and that way we would be able to maintain a bit of purity to the way Mr Bean works."" And it works well, once you get into that way of thinking. His main words throughout the movie are, ""Qui"", ""Non,"" and ""Gracias"" (he seems to think all these are French.) His two travelling companions, Stepan and Sabine, either don't speak English or don't realise he is English.One of my favourite scenes is when he starts busking to get some money. Bean gyrates inventively to different types of music, but is only when he lip-syncs to Puccini's 'O Mi Babbino Caro' (aided by Stepan playing his 'dead' child) that the locals love him and shower them with coins.At times I felt Bean's selfishness was irksome - he would just steal things - like someone's bike - when he needed to chase a chicken that had his train ticket caught in its foot. But I kept watching, fascinated. ""I don't think he's a nice man to spend time with because he's selfish and self-centred,"" says Atkinson, ""but people forgive him because they think he's just a child and they just enjoy the silliness and naivety.He also uses the delayed discovery device well - as when he gets rid of oysters in a nearby diner's handbag. But in essence we enjoy the fact that he follows his whims and, when he doesn't conform, it is in a way that makes perfect sense to him, however outrageous. A concatenation of events leads him inevitably to Cannes (for the first time ever, the crew were even allowed to film on the red carpet during the festival). I had several times felt that, amusing as the character is, can he really justify 90 minutes of continuous viewing? The ending however is quite clever, and suggests a triumph of silent film over sound.Rowan Atkinson attracted wide critical notice at the Edinburgh Festival in 1977 and then launched Mr Bean onto TV in 1990. The first Bean film grossed over $260 million worldwide on in 1997 - a remarkable sum for what many would see as fairly middle-of-the-road comedy. But the key is that it can be immediately understood in any language, anywhere in the world.Mr. Bean's Holiday continues the tradition of silent comedy. It is a major accomplishment for British screen exporting. As a phenomena, it is near unique at the present time. But although it will screen successfully on airlines from every part of the globe, it may be judged by many as only just substantial enough for mainstream cinema experience in its country of origin.Stay to the end of the credits for an extra 'footnote' scene.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","zach-69","6 January 2008","Many comedian's use dirty language to be funny. Well, that is not the case with Rowan Atkinson. For many years I have watched him as Mr. Bean. A man who is completely clueless about the environments around him. Rowan's facial's and body language inside the character of Mr. Bean make him one of the funniest comedian's EVER!! Mr. Bean's Holiday is no exception! The film has a great story, very little dialogue. (I'm talking about Rowan when I say 'very little dialogue.') The acting is great from the entire cast. This movie was a major treat for me, because, one of my big time fave actor's, Willem Dafoe (Clear and Present Danger, Spider-Man, Finding Nemo, 007: Everything Or Nothing, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3.) Play's an impatient movie director. Dafoe is OUTSTANDING!!! Even though he might not have a big role in this movie, (like he does with the Spider-Man franchise.) Willem does a phenomenal job! This is a great movie!! Rowan Atkinson's facial are hysterical!! His facial expression's beat Jim Carrey's dirty humor!! LOL!! See this hilarious movie!!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jpschapira","2 April 2007","Have you seen Rowan Atkinson's face? And if you have, have you paid close attention to it? There's something about his face; about his eyes and the way he plays with them and with everything else in, of course, his face: which includes ears, nose, mouth and so on (or something like that). It's true that he took advantage of this a long time ago to create a character named Mr. Bean; it's also true that he was born to play this creature and that no other will ever be able to do it.My little cousin watches Atkinson's series about the same character, so he went to watch the film. ""It's a little bit scary"", he told me. In a way, he is right; because Mr. Bean's actions defy every moral rule and contain no precise explanation whatsoever. In other words, you would be freaked out if you encountered him on the street.And that is everyone's reaction in ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", where the man in question wins a trip to the beach of Cannes, France. The raffle organizer calls the winning number, '919', Bean has a paper which says '616' but of course, he doesn't realize until he throws it into the wagon of a little toy train and the number appears as it should be. He also wins a digital camera with the trip and he uses it to shoot random things and to film himself doing strange movements with his face and in occasions eating food he finds disgusting.These are the kind of things, which happen in the movie; these are the type of situations you should expect. Although most of the time it is predictable, the humor flows naturally and the jokes are naturally amusing. As Bean himself with his camera, the director's shots are disinterested and don't seem premeditated in a good way, which leaves the viewer a clear idea that the picture doesn't take itself too seriously and makes the experience much more enjoyable.There are a couple of moments which could have been spared and two or three times where the rhythm decays completely, but when it gets back on track the audience breaks into a constant laugh. Robin Driscoll, Simon McBurney and Hamish McColl wrote the screenplay; but it would have been the same if they hadn't done anything, because there are not many spoken words in the movie.In fact, Atkinson, who is the main attraction, doesn't say more than thirty words in the whole film and frankly, that is just what makes ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" a good movie and Mr. Atkinson's performance a great piece of work. Maybe his beloved creature moves and acts in a way we've seen a thousand times before, but his portrayal is a marvelous demonstration of corporal expression; everything lies within the actor's body.That's also why the music plays a very important part in the film. Written by Howard Goodall, the score joins Mr. Bean in his adventures, happily playing behind him at all times, whether in the sound of a band or in an opportunity of making playback. The last scene has a little bit of another Mr., Mr. Magoo's style and this particular holiday truly makes me want to see all the work of one more Mr.; Charlie Chaplin.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","springsunnywinter","24 April 2007","I just seen this film on the cinema and there was nothing special about it. There is hardly any story line & lacks a single decent joke. All Mr Bean doe's is tape his holiday with a camcorder all the way through the movie. Some of the scenes in the film were inspired from the TV series e.g. when he was in the French restaurant & he did not like the seafood so he just put all of it in a lady's bag, that scene was taken from the episode when it was Mr Bean's birthday he did not like the steak. The TV series is good and funny but the film is a complete time pass, it's like your watching someone's home video when they were away on holiday. Overall it's OK to be watched once if it's on TV or something but not the kind of film to watch on cinema or bought on DVD.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","roger-212","26 December 2007","Rowan Atkinson is one of our most refreshing clowns and has had a long career, in UK films and the Bean shows and films. This film not only nails his innocence and good-natured cluelessness (without much of the show's occasional mean-spiritedness) but it's a very well-directed, surprisingly assured and subtly-themed road movie about someone who just wants to go to the beach, and how such an innocent goal can be worthwhile.People seem to want to really badmouth this film - come on, folks, it really doesn't deserve it. The corporate Adam Sandler and Dane Cook sh==fests are much more soul-sucking.This one actually nods to Jacques Tati, with a nice post-modern twist - Bean's home movie ends up on the screen in Cannes, as the show-stealing hit of the festival.If you're predisposed to Rowan and Bean, check it out.","

This movie is about the 7th Art and how humor was built within it along the years.Rowan Atkinson managed to express his deepest sympathy for Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Jacques Tati ( bien sûr... ) and at the same time, by giving Mr Bean a video camera he met with the latest style of visual comedy ( Jackass, etc... )This movie becomes a research on how people laugh in a movie theater, and the poetry it all brought to the final film made me cheer.Thank you for your time, I hope these few words were of some interest.","

I saw it at a birthday party, so that would be fun. I thought the movie was silly really. But it was really hilarious. It lost some marks though because the humor was really childish, seriously. And the events that happen are extremely unlikely. The part where the bus ticket fell into a Chicken Pen just got me. But I still laughed at that part. And Carson Clay's movie called Playback was stupid. That movie wouldn't even go on the big screen because it made everybody fall asleep.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","25 March 2007","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Rowan Atkinson once again reprises his role as the hapless Mr Bean, who wins a trip to the South of France in a church raffle. Predictably, upon his arrival, mayhem and disaster begin to ensue, and he finds himself unwittingly saddled with the son of a Cannes Film Festival judge (Max Baldry) who is believed to have been kidnapped and the beautiful Rene (Emma de Cauntlis) who shares the same taste in cars as him. He keeps getting in the way of stuffy, egotistical movie maker Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe) whose film he disrupts with his own video camera at the end of the film.Like the best TV shows, Bean simply doesn't translate well to film. What's funny on screen for half an hour does not necessarily work it over the course of an hour and a half film. Sadly, with Mr Bean's Holiday, it's more a case of a dead horse being flogged once again to no effect, in that it makes the first film seem positively Oscar worthy in comparison.It's the usual, largely unfunny, slightly dated selection of pratfalls and slapstick that you'd associate with Mr Bean, with a sketchy, apathetic plot and dark overtones of paedophilia in relation to Bean's relationship with the boy and his coming into contact with him.Atkinson has announced, though, that this will be the last story in relation to Mr Bean. Honestly, though, you have to wonder why he didn't make this announcement after the disastrous 1997 movie adaptation. *","

Perhaps the lack in recent years of comedy films of comparable quality (any recommendations?) means some reviewers are out of practise in appraising such films - otherwise I cannot account for the negative reviews. This is not a one man show either with excellent performances by several members of the cast. Whilst I gave the film 10 my wife was probably only an 8 or 9 but my 18 year old son was definitely another 10. My 16 year old daughter was nearer 7 as was likewise my 13 year old daughter and her friend. Nevertheless definitely a film for the whole family. Highly recommended and for likers of comedy I would say unmissable. Let's hope this is not the last from this particular stable !","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","FilmCriticLalitRao","30 June 2008","Mr.Bean's Holiday is a unique family film which has all the necessary ingredients used in the making a successful comedy film.Apart from its numerous inoffensive commentaries of serious nature on tangible universal sentiments like love,trust,respect etc,there is plenty of scope in this film for freewheeling entertainment.The highlight of this film is that it entertains all viewers regardless of their knowledge or ignorance about Rowan Atkinson's comical genius.It might be said that watching this film might induce a feeling in some viewers' minds that Mr.Bean mocks France and French culture.This has been shown by depicting how Cannes International Film Festival derides itself by ignoring its own film fraternity in order to show over-the-top reverence for American filmmakers on French soil.This film's director Steve Bendelack offers us plenty to see including marvelous views of French countryside and TGV,French high speed train.If one has already been to France,these views would be a great source of nostalgia.If a viewer of this film has not been to France,it is hoped that it would serve as a precursor to an imminent voyage to France.An important lesson to be learned from this film involves today's globalized world where a language is not at all important as the entire world is slowly transforming itself into a huge efficient supermarket where people can go and purchase their stuff without uttering a single world of any human language.This is precisely something which enables many people including Mr.Bean to say gracias in Paris.The flip side of this case is that these people are having nice time at the expense of natives as they are being fully understood by them.Mr.Bean's Holiday is a hilarious melting pot of assorted characters from different countries such as America,Britain,Russia and France.Rowan Atkinson's performance assures us that there are neither surprises nor there is any pretence, any foul play.He does everything smoothly to ensure that everything comes out with ease like a rabbit taken out skillfully from a maverick wizard's black hat.The icing on this film's cake is the realization that only Mr.Bean is one of those lucky people who are able to enter the premises of Cannes International Film Festival by making use of a hand made V.I.P.pass.","

The rubber-faced Mr. Bean has been a much loved character in our family, and I was delighted that he was his old bumbling self, with disaster trailing just behind him in fractal waves. Was it sentimental and over the top? Of course, that's Bean's whole appeal!The ending only served to remind us that Bean is not in the same pursuit of happiness that those around him superficially enjoy. He is very much a child at heart, specifically my own son's age. My son received a toy digital camera for his birthday present, and the first pictures he took were close-ups of his own nose and a lined picture of the television screen. Rowan Atkinson has captured that child-like vision with absolute perfection. The man is a comic genius.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Igenlode Wordsmith","11 April 2007","I found this film very nearly totally unwatchable. In all fairness I will say at the start that the cinema appeared to be filled with under-twelves enjoying themselves, and that on the way out I heard one proud father announce that this was the best film he'd seen all year; so no doubt I was the only one sitting there wincing in the darkness and seriously considering the public embarrassment of an escape. I stuck it out, more through cowardice than resolution, and was rewarded by some actual entertainment towards the end... but it was a very long time coming.The most frustrating thing is that there is obviously talent involved. Someone -- presumably Rowan Atkinson -- has an eye for a sight gag, his physical dexterity is impressive, and the supporting players were delightful. But by far the largest part of the film's running time is spent in what can most politely be termed 'cringe comedy', in which horribly obvious situations are milked for the most grotesque and/or disgusting reaction; Mr Bean himself, with his gibbering and gurning, comes across as a deeply distasteful character, and by the time he gets slapped in the face it is long, long overdue. This film is probably not for the over-sensitive or for those who identify with the humiliation of on-screen characters...The film makes extensive use of a hand-held video camera -- we are treated to a large number of wobbly shots of Mr Bean filming himself -- and coupled with the use of this 'found footage' in the finale, I think that this theme may have been intended as some kind of satire on the modern holiday experience or else the 'hand-held' look as pretentious film-making. However, the main impression I got was that all those skewed views of Bean's eyes and nose, etc, were expected to be inherently funny; which, for me, they weren't.The payoff is worth having, though. The sequence in which (avoiding spoilers...) the Bean home movies are screened in an entirely inappropriate context is one of the few laugh-out-loud scenes I found in the film, and was rightfully picked out as such by most of the mainstream newspaper reviewers.But it is ironic that this gag depends entirely on the voice-over, since the whole set-up for the film has clearly been designed to limit the requirement for English dialogue at all. (In fact, from my own point of view, a goodly proportion of the total amusement factor was to be obtained by translating the swathes of spoken French and Russian back from the subtitles. Confusingly, there is at least one joke, involving the mispronunciation of a French obscenity, that doesn't make a great deal of sense as rendered into English; an accurate equivalent probably wouldn't have made it into a 'U' certificate, but it made me wonder just who the script was supposed to be aimed at.) Rowan Atkinson has been called 'the last of the silent comedians', but so far as he was concerned I think I'd probably have found the performance easier to bear if he *had* been silent: the 'flobalob' stuff was just off-putting. Most of the visual humour in this film I didn't find at all funny, since it is painfully obvious in advance and consists of waiting and wincing for the inevitable. There were a couple of sight-gags that I think I would probably have appreciated when performed by another character in another context, such as Bean's single-minded pursuit of the compass. And there is one genuinely inspired piece of misdirection and visual ingenuity towards the very end of the film that pays homage to the silent era; and proves once again the difference between the level of humour that relies on falling over an anticipated banana-skin, and the one that involves ingeniously *not* falling over it...","

Some spots are a bit tedious and drawn-out but the Sony Videocam is a great plot gimmick and a real product! The best scene is in the French Bistro where Bean orders the beautiful seafood platter and makes it into a disgusting mess. He draws his passport photo when he loses the real one. No violence other than the mayhem that follows him around endlessly. Lots of ingenious little comic ""bits"" than Bean fans will enjoy. A bit of a travelog as well Not to be confused with ""Bean""(1997) which, for me, is not funny at all.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Ali_John_Catterall","19 March 2007","And so to one of Britain's biggest money-spinning exports, the gurning, grunting Mr Bean. We try to pretend this Rose d'Or-winning, pan-global phenomenon, stripped of all cultural signifiers, has been merely designed as in-flight fodder to keep French schoolchildren pacified on Atlantic crossings. Or as revenge for Roberto Benigni. This attitude fails to take into account the long tradition of British slapstick (Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel), which, funnily enough, we also couldn't wait to offload overseas.All prejudices aside, the main criteria for judging physical comedy is very simply: does is make you say ""Ha!"" in prolonged staccato bursts? Blessed with the patronage of top British producers Working Title, cameos from the stately likes of Willem Dafoe and Jean Rochefort, and product placements for Dunlop tyres, Mr Bean's Holiday comes with a bigger leg-up than most. Yet the logical response to this bizarre farrago is not one of anger or annoyance, but confusion: it's a comedy that doesn't make you laugh. At all. In fact, it's downright creepy.In Mr Bean's Holiday (the title makes the Hulot homage even more explicit), Mr Bean (the extraordinary-faced Rowan Atkinson) enters a church raffle, winning a trip to the South of France, plus a camcorder to record his adventures. It's a moot point whether he is the winner, however, as the winning ticket is '919', and Bean's is '616', but with a quick adjustment he's soon on his way to the Riviera. At least, he would be, had he not got the wrong taxi, and kept leaving things on trains. An awfully large chunk of the film revolves around our hero getting on and off trains, having left things on the platform or in the carriage. This is about as amusing as it would be in real life.He meets a stranded Russian boy (Baldry), whose father is one of the judges at the Cannes Film Festival. When Mr Bean tries to cheer him up by licking little bits of paper and pasting them to his fluttering eyelids and tongue, the Russian boy slaps him very hard across the face. Good. This is the correct response. Meandering from one unfunny scenario to the next he accidentally blows up a film set (something we don't even get to see), presided over by art-house director Carson Clay (Dafoe); hooks up with one of Clay's actresses, Sabine (De Caunes, daughter of Eurotrash host Antoine) who's had her big scene shredded; and winds up hijacking the Cannes premiere by substituting his own video diary for Clay's film.Says Atkinson, ""What's interesting is the way these two (films) merge and overlap and intertwine and so there is this sense in which the nature of movies and movie-making is at the centre of our story."" You could look at it like that. You could also look at it as a bit of camcorder footage. At a stretch, there are slim but salient points being made here about pretentious critics, exploited young actresses, and filmmakers forced to shoot culturally patronising adverts to subsidise their serious movies. Trouble is, though presented as pretentious twaddle (""This film is for those of us who cry out in pain, whose souls yearn to sing"", as Dafoe's ponderous voice-over has it) what we see of Clay's movie is still more gripping than Mr Bean's Holiday.In mitigation, the French are presented almost entirely without stereotyping, and there is one scene that might raise the mouth-corners, in which a street-performing Mr Bean mimes Puccini's 'O Mio Babbino Caro' like an hysterical Italian opera widow, while cradling a pretend dead boy. But, see, the thing about putting Mr Bean in proximity to children is: it looks bad. Not to mince words, the bloke looks like a sex-offender. In real-life, parents would encourage their children to ""come away, quickly"". Hence, presumably, De Caunes' role, to restore the film's equilibrium to a fun-filled family set-up.Time hasn't been kind to Bean. Comic sensibilities have changed, in Britain at least, since he first crash landed on TV in 1988. Atkinson has stated this will be the last Mr Bean film. Please, make it so. As featured soundtrack artist Matt Willis sings in his cover of The Primitives 'Crash', ""I've had enough, enough of you, enough to last a life time through.""","

This movie was essentially a silent film, with a lot of recycled Mr. Bean gags and footage from a very shaky camcorder. Here are some samples of recycled gags:Mr. Bean locks himself in an outhouse. Sound familiar? Mr. Bean tries to get rid of some slimy oysters (that look like snot) by dumping them in a woman's purse.Mr. Bean tries to cheer up a depressed little boy- and fails.Mr. Bean chases a bus ticket across the countryside like he did in the episode with the golf ballMr. Bean, on the site of a film set, unplugs a very important electrical outlet which results in an explosion just to recharge his camcorder. I'm not saying that this movie didn't have it's genuine funny moments, but they were few and far between. You should probably spend your time watching the ""Best of Mr. Bean"" instead. The ending was also truly horrible and unbelievable, as all of a sudden every single person on the beach breaks character and sings along with Mr. Bean like they are on Broadway, making everything feel fake and pointless. Also, wouldn't the girl picking up a hitchhiker like Bean, be scared out of her mind? I know I would.","

This is the last we saw of Bean and, for sure, Atkinson took him out on a high note.Whilst I would still say I preferred the original Bean movie, the storyline of this one is probably stronger and perfect for Bean's character. Although, part of the reason I enjoyed the original Bean so much was the lack of emphasis on the plot, with the focus instead on the jokes and Bean.Bean is a timeless, hilarious character that will never wear thin. Ten years and many more views later, and this film will still make me laugh like the first time I saw it.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","mario_c","2 April 2007","Mr Bean is back, this time for holidays in France. If you have seen the first Mr Bean's movie you won't be disappointed with this sequel, because it's made with equal standards of humor and drama. The movie is pretty entertaining and has the typical kind of humor by Mr. Bean, but I was kind of surprised with one type of humor that I wasn't expecting in a Mr Bean's movie: the critic to the own cinema industry! Yes that's true, the Cannes Festival (one of the world's most important movie awards) is pretty messed up! I must say I enjoyed it a lot, because it was a kind of subtle and corrosive humor that I wasn't expecting in this film! The other jokes are the ""normal ones"" used by Mr Bean, but there are some pretty nice ones! I can remember the phone call scenes, which are just hilarious! The one of the dead guy is brilliant dark humor! The end is a bit melodramatic but it's not bad enough to spoil a great comedy. So, overall, it was another good and entertaining movie by the silliest English person: Mr Bean!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Andy-296","29 January 2008","I came to this movie without having seen the first film or even the TV series. I knew next to nothing about Mr. Bean, except that he was a famous comical character. I have seen Rowan Atkinson playing short parts in other films (for example, the seller in Love, Actually) and he seemed to me a good comedian, though nothing exceptional. So I was surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie about Mr. Bean basically traveling throughout France, and creating fun mayhem around it, how much I laugh at it. The gag in the restaurant goes back to silent cinema, but it's still effective. And when Mr. Bean arrives at the Cannes Film Festival, its mockery of the pretensions of art cinema is dead on (the ""art film"" shown in the festival directed by Willem Dafoe is a riot). Plus, the actress playing his ""love interest"" (Emma de Caunes) is extremely good. OK, perhaps it's not up to Jacques Tati's classic Mr. Hulot's holiday (whose title seems to have inspired it) but it is still loads of fun.","

The short Bean sketches which formerly appeared on TV were often very funny but this feature based on a series of vocal ignominies and the pulling of so called funny faces was unworthy of Atkinson and shamefully embarrassing for the viewer. Due to a lack of real content, certain scenes dragged on forever such as Bean's attempts at hitching a ride on a farmer's motorcycle and his ensuing escapade with a roadside shack. Slapstick in this movie was taken literally as everybody seemed to thoroughly enjoy slapping each other on the face. There is so little going on in Mr Bean's Holiday that it's difficult to comment on substance that isn't even there. Not recommended at all.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Beta_Gallinger","10 February 2008","Rowan Atkinson's extremely popular ""Mr. Bean"" character was introduced in the hit TV series. Since the demise of the series, the character has been brought to two full-length movies, first 1997's ""Bean"" (a.k.a. ""Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie""), and then 2007's ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"". Unfortunately, although Mr. Bean is very funny at times in both of them, it seems that these two movies have proved that he certainly isn't as consistent in the full-length format. In fact, the first movie may have been enough to show that.In Mr. Bean's second big screen adventure, he enters a raffle and wins first prize, a trip to southern France! Obviously, he is headed for trouble on this vacation. Life is never easy for Bean, and sadly for him, it won't be getting any easier while he is in France. One problem he will face, one which we've never seen him face before, is that he is now in a country where he doesn't know the language too well at all! However, since he talks very little, that is not his main problem. Just before the walking disaster boards another train after his stop in Paris, he gets Emil, a Russian man who is on his way to the Cannes Film Festival, to video tape him. After that, Bean manages to get on the train just before it leaves, but Emil is too late, and his son, Stepan is on the train! Emil tells Stepan through the window to get off at the next stop, and when this happens, Bean gets off with him. Sadly, the train leaves before Bean can get back on, and his suitcase is still aboard! The walking disaster must now help Stepan get back to his father, which obviously won't be easy for him (what is?), and he may be accused of child abduction! Since I found the first Mr. Bean movie a bit disappointing, my expectations weren't too high for this one, but as a fan, I felt I had to give it a try. Unsurprisingly, like ""Bean"", I certainly can't say this was a laugh-free experience, but it certainly wasn't like watching episodes of the show. The first major highlight I found in the movie gagwise was Bean spilling coffee on the keyboard of a sleeping man's laptop during his first train ride. After that, Bean in a Paris restaurant during his stop and hating his food is good for several laughs, and I certainly can't forget Mr. Bean later lip-syncing to opera! There are some more highlights, some of them involving Bean's camcorder (a device we've never seen him use before), but I was definitely a little bored at times, mostly early on in the film. All the good gags in the movie could have been done in short sketches (like in the show), without all the lacklustre scenes in this feature.I'm not sure whether to rate this movie 6 or 7. I gave ""Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie"" a 6, and I think I found ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" slightly funnier. I should also mention that this film is more like the show than the first one is, as it is more visual with less dialogue. This is mainly due to the language differences between the characters. However, I certainly wouldn't rate this movie as highly as the TV show (9/10), and unlike the show, I wouldn't say either movie is great for multiple viewings. If you're a big fan of the first movie, this second one is probably a must-see. If you didn't find ANY of the first movie amusing, you should probably skip ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"". Lastly, if you found the first one mildly amusing at times, it would probably be the same case with this one.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jrarichards","20 February 2018","In ""Mr Bean's Holiday"" from British Director Steve Bendelack the world-famous Rowan Atkinson character gets a wider canvas than the TV show allowed him, speaks - just a little, and perhaps tames his darker side somewhat. As a bonus, many of the French settings are gorgeous, and a certain rather pleasing chemistry develops between Bean and a Russian boy played by (authentically-Russian-speaking) Brit child actor Max(im) Baldry; only for this to extend rather neatly into a small circle once it starts to include the archetypal carefree and beautiful (and Mini-driving) young French lady played just superbly - without much effort at all - by Emma de Caunes. The fact that this young beauty allows her character to join Bean in doing certain comedic and occasionally even dumb things offers a huge and joyful - and sexy - kick for the viewer. It is thanks largely to the benevolence and acceptance personified by this character (Sabine - and what else could she be called, really?) that, in this section of the film at least, misfit Bean somehow begins to fit in, and it's a delight, rather than a disappointment, and one only highlighted by a conflict-cooperation scenario evolving with the aid of a pretentious American film director encountered previously by the key characters and nicely done by actor Willem Dafoe - who sends himself up very proficiently indeed.In a way that harks back to many a musical you've seen, this all crescendoes into our entire cast plus a host of extras parading along Cannes beach and singing along with Charles Trenet's ""La Mer"". It's a surprisingly powerful and truly heartwarming ending, and one we've reached via what are, in the film's terms, a series of entirely logical steps (including steps taken off a tallish building, via a descending step-like series of vehicles!!). This is Harold Lloyd in 2007.Similar logical steps leading to crazy disaster and mayhem are taken earlier on in the film, too, as Atkinson's Bean moves through a series of escalating mishaps that frustrate the audience (almost to their limits?) at regular intervals as his basically well-meaning wish to help out sees him lose luggage, ticket, passport and so on, and thus inevitably condemns him to fall foul of authority figures. There is a great deal of Laurel and Hardy in this scenario, which contrasts markedly - if effectively and even necessarily - with the above-described second half of the film. Again reminiscent of some aspects of Stan and Ollie are gags that leave one feeling momentarily queasy, but of course do Bean no lasting harm - Bean doing oysters and langoustines in a station restaurant is a case in point, and may indeed prove ""hard to swallow"" for the viewer!A key question might be how many of the gags really came straight out of Atkinson's head, but the likely answer would seem to be ""many"", and of course this also at times denotes innocent silliness turning to what is - by Bean standards at least - sly or vengeful or pseudo-competitive activity.The fact that this gives way to feelgood later on may represent a slight betrayal of the character's heritage, but on the whole it's rewarding for the viewer. Probably essential and wise too, since a whole film on the lines of the first half might prove too waring and wearying. Overall, this eclectic approach continually minds us of Laurel and Hardy and Chaplin, occasionally even Keaton or the aforesaid Lloyd. However, since we're in France, thoughts are also inevitably going to stray to the tradition of the great Jacques Tati. It then becomes most interesting for the more careful and aware viewer to assess how clever Atkinson's dumb act can look in the esteemed company the above comedians represent. All in all, the answer for me would be ""pretty clever"", and I found much to admire in the film's handling of itself.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Chrissysven","11 December 2007","When my sister came home with ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" from Blockbuster my first thought was a sarcastic ""Oh great"". (I have watched a few of the show's episodes and didn't find the slapstick comedy as effective as others), But as we started watching the movie, Mr. Bean's adorable and innocent character grew on me and smiles were starting to appear. The part that especially touched me was when Mr. Bean changes the movie to help out his friend. I thought it was such a beautiful movie moment. I reminded me of the movie Amélie from Montmartre. Mr. Bean's use of the camera seemed extremely stupid at the beginning, but then as time went on it gave you a sense of familiar coziness and you realized it added a huge part to this film. The sarcastic and ironic humor was brilliant! At first it seemed pointless that all these random events were being put into such a blob, but as time proceeds you realize this movie is like a surprise trip: you don't know where you're going until you get there.Apart from the ingenious plot and the humor, the cinematography was just fantastic: the colors were vivid and playful and the scenery and visual effects were just outstanding. One thing usually unmentioned in this movie's reviews is the acting, since those who watched the series know exactly what to expect from Mr. Bean, but particularly in this movie Rowan Atkinson was great. It wasn't overdone or exaggerated, but instead Atkinson delivered his character with a sweetness and naiveness that is rare to see in films today. It's specially a hard thing to do when you can't talk but only a few miniature lines. His facial expressions were fantastic, and overall he was just perfect. Emma de Caunes was also very good, she was another part of the movie just like a surprise road trip, you had no clue who she was or what she was doing in this movie until you got to your final destination. The soundtrack was also a plus, it was just vibrant and feel-good all the way to the end.This movie was not just some silly ending to Mr. Bean, it was the cherry on top of his whole television lifetime. It's guaranteed to make anyone's heart soften. In just a few words, this was beautifully done.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","hte-trasme","11 September 2010","""Mr Bean's Holiday"" is a very funny film, and one that is very clearly (and probably very self-awarely) in the tradition of much of what was produced by the great silent feature comedians such as Buster Keaton. While it doesn't quite reach the heights that those performers sometimes could with their own very idiosyncratic talents, it's still well within the realm of success. As a film, it revels rather delightfully in its own extreme unlikeliness and becomes a kind of symphony of coincidences, taking place in a parallel world where things this strange will happen. One of things things the movie does best is create a balance between the precarious and absurd plot that spins out from Bean's series of travelling predicaments and his eventual accidental abduction of a famous director's son, and some very nice comedy set pieces, which give Rowan Atkinson a chance really to display his character in its element -- Mr. Bean trapped in an outhouse, forced to wrangle with intimidated raw seafood in a fancy restaurant, or busking by pantomiming to a stolen speaker from a CD salesman. Rowan Atkinson is a great comedy performer, and, of course his timing and eccentric reactions make all the comedy scenes. I think one of the reasons Mr Bean works so well is that once we have a handle on the character everything he does makes a sort of crooked sense in context, yet we are still constantly surprised by the ways his weirdness makes itself evident. Incidentally to the character itself, I found myself really enjoying the overblown parody of art films when the action reaches the Cannes Film Festival. This has the feel of very pure or elemental comedy about it, but with the film parody and suggestions of child molestation it doesn't quite feel taken out of time. It never becomes uproarious or timeless farce, but it is consistently quite funny and done with competence. It's got a good rhythm, a joyful feel, and a an exuberant ending. I'd have no problem seeing it again.","

When the posters of this movie were released I had a certain sense of relief that at last I would be able to see Rowan Atkinson again. I have great respect and empathy towards Rowan because I had heard that he had passed through several phases of depressions (I don't know whether it is true or not!) due to professional failures after ""Mr.Bean"" series got over.This second movie of Mr.Bean is about Mr.Bean winning a trip from London to Paris to Cannes and his journey to Cannes beach where he will spend his holiday. The director Steve Bendelack who is known more for his work with TV has tried to capture the magic of Mr.Bean series in this movie.The expectations from Mr.Bean are always so high that there are more chances for the movie to under-perform and so is the case. This return of Mr.Bean even though with ample funny incidences fails to recreate the magic. Rowan Atkinson looks jaded and tired but maintains the weirdness of Mr.Bean. The story has some reminisces (or may I say inspiration) of ""Bicycle Thieves"" in the way Mr.Bean's journey is along with a boy  played by Max Baldry  who is separated from his father and Mr.Bean helps the boy in the end to meet the father.The opening of the movie is favorable in Amsterdam, with the movie hall full with young children, I hope it continues.(Stars 4 out of 10)","

Maybe it's because it's been a while since we last saw him wreaking havoc in Los Angeles back in 1997. Nevertheless, this sequel proves a bit worthy, albeit with a major flaw.The story sounds half cooked and un-inspirational, but with Atkinson's antics, you can't help but forget any doubts about this movie and laugh along with others. It's more like a feel-good movie, with Bean getting himself into trouble and out of it, with consequences for others! And all this humor concludes in a bizarre ending that signals Bean's farewell to the world (as this is his last performance as Bean ).The supporting cast actors are quite enjoyable; the child actor playing the missing boy is not annoying like most child actors nowadays, the female actress who brings along Bean and the boy to Cannes in her mini-cooper which is exactly identical to Bean's, minus the padlock, and Dafoe, which we will always remember as The Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man movie, plays an overzealous filmmaker, who plans to shock the audiences at the film festival with his latest project. I couldn't help but squeal with laughter as Bean interrupts his film with Bean's own holidays videos! Overall, a feel-good movie that you should bring someone along to watch with you.

But, this has wonderful scenery, music and moves right along with a plot that fits right in with Mr. Bean. If you find yourself getting into this movie, you hate to see it end. The film does a wonderful job of blending in the sub plots with the main theme of the show.It's funny, witty, not corny, not dirty and something that you can take the kids to see; it's on a level that kids will enjoy but also one that adults won't find anywhere near on a ""pokemon"" level. There's something for everyone in this movie except the critics. I wonder how they get paid? It has a predictable format: Comedy, a bit of drama/conflict and perhaps a tiny bit of romance thrown together. The comedy is new, the conflict something that in which many people can identify, and with the romance, well, just a tiny, tiny bit and only a hint at that. But, with Mr. Bean, you know, he always wipes off the kisses.The real star of this movie is the child actor Max Baldry. This kid steals the show in every scene he's in. Quite funny is the scene with Mr. Bean and him sitting on a bench while the kid mimics Mr. Bean's every move.From the TV series, Mr. Bean is a somewhat predictable and sometimes presented as a 2-D type character but pulls it off as a comedy, sometimes better than in other episodes. But, this movie adds a whole nother dimension to Mr. Bean that I thought never possible.One notable moment is Mr. Bean posing for photographs and appearing, while unfunny, rather respectable which adds depth to the character, the scene and the situation as a whole. Makes you want to be there.There's a couple of predictable scenes or so it seems, but with a twist that ends most unexpectedly; there is never a dull moment.Seems like this film has been given the thumbs down by some critics but maybe they're just negative people, made their minds up before seeing it, didn't actually see it or just plain hate Mr. Bean, regardless.Could it be because some of these critics are too much like Mr. Bean in their real lives? Have I found a hole in the wall with some of these critics: single, lonely men, hating their jobs, hating anyone else having a good time and doing the things they'd really like to do? Or, is it that they get more money for trashing films rather than giving an honest review? Nobody reads good news.There's a few things you can't do when watching this film. You can't leave without feeling good. And, you can't end it without wanting to see it again.","

I was never a fan of the TV series, but found both features quite entertaining.Clearly there are influences from the silent era and slapstick, and Bean would be recognisable to anyone familiar with Chaplin, Keaton et al. The plots are simple and the laughs come from Bean's antics and interaction with a series of bemused officials.Here he is paired with a child and a beautiful woman, so again Chaplin comes to mind. A simple journey goes horribly wrong for Bean and everyone unfortunate enough to come in contact with him, but of course it all ends well.You know what you're going to get, and the film delivers. All the ingredients are there, in just about the right quantities. It's a cup of cocoa or mashed potato - comforting and warm.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","rabbe","17 September 2017","It doesn't happen very often to me, but I think this film actually gets better with repeat viewings. Ten years after release, the criticisms at the time seem pretty petty; the film really works as an extension of the TV series and an homage to, on one end, the European comedy tradition of Jaques Tati, and on the other end, silent movie slapstick. And the references to pretentious cinema auteurs seems even more relevant today than ten years ago. The film has a nice, slow pace I appreciate more and more, and it's expertly produced and photographed. The supporting cast is good, especially French Emma de Caunes, who manages to portray some extraordinary sweet normalcy, as a contrast to Mr Beans antics.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","furiso1","4 April 2007","Mr. Bean is back with a vengeance This movie has got to be the funniest movie i have seen since the first Mr Bean movie. The movie has more laughter in it but also has more serious bits in it as well. William DeFoe did a great job as the abnouctions director. Rowan Atkinson really has made the return to the screens with a major impact with this film. It is even funnyer since it is in France,with him not understanding anything is the icing on the top. Another thing that was great was the addtion of some romance near the end, and is something you expect to happen to Mr. Bean. Plus having his home movie put on the big screen was a nice finish","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","kosmasp","1 April 2021","Are you aware of Mr. Bean? Do you call Rowan Atkinson that name? Because that is how you identify him? Yes he also is or was Johnny English (a mixture of Bean and Clouseau I reckon), but Mr. Bean is the one role most know him of and as.This is one of the cinematic outputs we got that brings him to another country. So his ticks and tocks get a new place to be: France! Since he doesn't really talk (a couple of words and sometimes for comedy effect he blurts out spanish words, which is more in line with ignorant American behaviour, but that is only if you overthink it), there is not much loss here ... or gain I reckon. The movie does have a certain storyline that does get evident at some point in the movie. It's therefor not just a string of unfortunate events.The movie is decent enough for one watch ... fans probably will go at it multiple times.","

I think the reason a lot of American people won't get this kind of humor is because, duh, it's more British humor. You know like Monty Python and Benny Hill and Faulty Towers, that type of humor.This character is classic and I can't wait till this movies open.Good, bad or indifferent, I'm going to see it.Just go with an open mind that's all and you will enjoy yourself.Trust me - you will have a lot of fun.Don't go in there to be critical and to judge the writing or the lighting or something technical - just go in to have fun!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","MidnightWarrior","28 August 2007","Comparing the 1997 Bean movie against this one is equivalent to comparing apples and oranges: both are two very different films and cannot be compared equally.The first Bean film was made with classical Hollywood values. In other words, it was very much an American film that was written with Mr. Bean's character inserted into it. Also, the rating of the film was PG-13. The content of the film was completely different than what most people are used to seeing on Bean's series.This new film (rated G) is more truer to it's roots and is laden with European flair. There's more slapstick British humor and it's an overall very clean, easy to watch film. Needless to say, the content is different than American cinema.Sure the film has little dialog, except for the end, but isn't that what Mr. Bean is all about? We get our pleasure from watching his actions. And whenever he opens his mouth and says, ""I'm Bean"" or something like that in that insanely deep voice, well it's just too funny! It's wonderful to know that after all these years Rowan Atkinson hasn't altered his performance or the way he plays Bean.Willem Dafoe and Emma De Caunes also give a spectacular performance! Who knew Dafoe could be so funny?! Yes, parts of the film were borrowed from some episodes. But that hardly makes them unbearable or not enjoyable. They are just as fun to watch now as they were then. And let's talk about the ending! Wow! Parts of the film in the beginning were slow, but the ending is so RIGHTEOUS! I won't spoil it, but I throughly enjoyed this film all because of the wonderful ending. Everything came together so brilliantly! This is definitely a family film to watch. I never watch G rated films, but I'll admit that Bean's Holiday has to be the best G movie that's come out in a very long time. It's clean, it's funny, refreshing and watching Rowan as Bean again was just so enjoyable. For all these reasons, I give it 10/10 and hope that this won't be the last Bean film.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jburtroald95","15 March 2009","This is the best, and sadly the last Mr. Bean ever created. It's even better than the original 'Bean' (1997), full of the same magic as the television series. As always starring the talented Sir Rowan Atkinson as the funny and seemingly eccentric Mr. Bean. This film finds him winning a holiday to a beautiful beach in France. He gets to France with no problems at all. But when trying to get to the beach a series of events finds him stranded on a train platform with no suitcase, no money and a young boy who, thanks to him, has been separated from his father. The things that happen as a result of that are hilarious and extremely entertaining. The film also has an important message that even the strangest person on earth can have friends and do extremely kind and clever things. Although, the scene in which the train is pulling away from the station with the boy still aboard and the father still on the platform was very sad and didn't feel like Mr. Bean at all.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","deloudelouvain","7 August 2016","The reason I score Mr. Bean's Holiday so low is because the story is just not good enough to keep you interested for the entire movie. And beside the occasional good laughing scene most of the other scenes are just things we saw before. Those things used to be funny when you see them for the first time but after seeing them over and over you get a bit bored by it. Rowan Atkinson as bean is mostly know for his crazy mimics. Dialogues you won't get, ever, and that's fine, because that's how Bean works. But too much of the same isn't good either. Plus the fact that they show this movie over and over here is also a thing that doesn't make me rate it higher. I do laugh every now and then with Bean but if I had to chose then I would just watch Blackadder again. There you can see Rowan Atkinson at his best. If you never saw any Bean movie then you will probably enjoy the absurd humor and mimics in Mr.Bean's Holiday. Otherwise you probably will get bored like me after a while.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","zzapper-2","28 August 2007","This film certainly has its lovers and haters. I really didn't like his last film, the Bond spoof Johnny English, so had low expectations for this one; which always help. I laughed a lot at this one, but also got a little stressed by the painfulness of his travel related disasters. Any way I advise you stay with the film, get over the awkward bits. I'm trying to write this without spoiling it for you or over-building it, but it's more than a comedy, it's a little homage to cinema, to Jaques Tati and to France. Anyway as they say just let yourself go , and go with the film. I'll watch it again tomorrow. It's nice to see a film with practically no dialogue as well. This film doesn't push every idea to it's conclusion, I think it's part of its languid (gosh never used that word before) charm. Go see","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","eternalsea","24 August 2007","It's clear from the opening ten minutes of Mr.Bean's Holiday if you'll like it or hate it, indeed for those who encountered the stretchy faced simpletons other motion picture or any of the T.V material you'll know before you buy a ticket or sit down to watch. It's no secret that Rowan Atkinson's Mr.Bean is a love or hate commodity, the man's antics overjoy some but repulse others, and so when I sat down to watch I was rather pleased that I belong to the former camp. The film is simple in it's plotting, Bean wins a ticket, some spending money and a camcorder to visit the south of France. Indeed the first comic set-piece is over with prior to the opening credits having been completed and Bean has found himself within the French domain earlier still. As with any adventure involving the character it's not just about a holiday, Bean quickly causes disaster and devastation, being accused of kidnapping a child and ruining a celebrated filmmakers day at the Cannes festival, along with numerous other problems. The film is well paced and presents enough amusement to keep all parts of the audience amused. I personally thought it a weaker venture than 1997's Bean, but not by all that much, the character still has enough idiotic potential and charm to make this a worthwhile project. Atkinson portrays Bean with the same manic energy we have associated with the character for nearly 20 years, and several of the jokes and gags are completely dependent on the conviction of his goofing, which thankfully cannot once be brought under critical questioning. He slips from disaster zone to disaster zone with ease and the audience will lap up that aspect of the film for sure. In support we have a rather weak set of persons however, actors ranging from Karel Roden to Emma de Caunes right back to Willem Dafoe fail to make any real impact. The latter playing a snobbish film director has a few laughs come the finale but any scene he features in prior is not made by his being there. Dafoe clearly is having a good time but he might have done more to please the audience than himself. The rest are banal and bland Emma de Caunes looks great, but makes for an unconvincing love interest and the sub plot involving Karel Roden and his lost child is stolen by Atkinson. The screenplay really can't have amounted to much (most of the film is in french) but any of the gags formulated within the script must have been quite good. The screenwriters have written for the character before and thus they have a firm grip on his stengths and weaknesses. At times a joke (usually devoid of Bean's presence) will fall flat and there are large sections of the film that are aimed strictly at the under 12's but overall if you let yourself go and don't judge to harshly this is a decent set of gags and farcical situations. The movie is bound to do decent business in the USA when it see's release later this month but having taken over £200,000,000 in Europe already the film must be classified as a success. Reviews have been hard occasionally cruel, but then thats just the nature of this beast. I enjoyed the production and will still look fondly on the character (this is supposed to be his final appearance) but not everyone will share my sentiments, and so before bothering to write a review or pay for admission think to yourself ""Do I actually want to see this?"" Once you know that you know what to do, and if you make the same choice as me I doubt you'll regret it.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","cdelacroix1","19 December 2007","I was at the dollar movie theater today, and the film in the movie I went to see broke, so I ducked out and caught the last half of Mr Bean's Holiday instead.And was just delighted.I've seen the whole movie before - I went with my aunt and a young cousin who loves Mr Bean - and liked it very much then, too.The movie was clearly designed to be neither more nor less nor other than good fun & entertainment, and it delivers and delivers well. Of course people either love Mr Bean or hate Mr Bean. I'm kind of in the middle: I think he can be funny ... but more in small doses than big. But that's just me.Back about the movie, it's a great Mr Bean flick that's fun from beginning to end. Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean is ... well, Mr Bean. Emma de Caunes' Sabine is just adorable, utterly captivating. The comic parody of pretentious film-makers in Willem Dafoe's Carson Clay and his Cannes film entry is to me just hilarious. The script is well-crafted and supports a storyline that is a small gem: in the grand Mr Bean tradition, he's off on holiday and everything that can go wrong goes wrong ... until the end, when everything that can go right goes right.All in all, this is a good movie, full of fun ... Mr Bean fun. And that's not such a bad thing at all.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Pjtaylor-96-138044","24 April 2019","I mean, it's fine. There's nothing particularly special about it but it's not absolutely awful, either. Having said that, though, it certainly doesn't match the charm, or comedic value, of the series it's based on, despite cribbing a few scenes almost directly from it. Atkinson himself isn't really at fault. He's, essentially, as rubber-limbed and uninhibited as ever. It's just the writing that lets him down. The piece is occasionally chuckle-worthy but never properly funny. Its best two gags are out of the way within the first two minutes and it never reaches those middling heights again. It also features some strange, out-of-place humour that really should've been reconsidered - I mean, one throwaway joke sees a man literally kill himself in the middle of the movie. Despite all this, it's a hard piece to properly dislike, in a way. It moves briskly enough and is generally harmless, feeling like a silly little outing with some bizarre interludes - not unlike its protagonist's own holiday. The best stuff, strangely, comes in the form of some relatively spot-on satire concerning a pretentious actor-director (played by Willem Dafoe of all people) and his self-important entry into the Cannes film festival. Without that, I think this would've lost its steam around the halfway point. With it, it just about carries you through to the end. It may be hard to dislike, but it's almost equally hard to like - with any real passion, that is. As I said, it's fine. 5/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","kooleshwar","2 May 2007","As i say this I must also say that I did not go with my family to watch this movie but with a bunch of guys who normally watch only R-rated comedies (preferably involving teens).Yet due to the fond memories of watching Mr. Bean when we were younger and the fact that we felt we needed a change we went for the movie.And despite the kind of movies we watch normally, WE WERE LAUGHING, and even though we were continuously bitching about the how predictable and stupid this movie was, we were still laughing even while complaining.And why not just because something is stupid doesn't mean its not funny, if the Americans have their way with world cinema they will stuff jokes down our throats that involve nothing but sex and love, I have yet to see even a children's animated movie that doesn't have some sexual/love themes.This movie on the hand relies on sheer buffoonery/stupidity and hilarious situations to be funny, any under-lying themes are about friendship, hope and happiness.Yet the joke that is the MPAA has rated this movie PG haha! If ever there was a case to have a new rating system this was it, there is not a movie that is more suited to receive the G rating as this.Despite the G rating Emma da Caunes looks smashingly cute, she has not shown as much as cleavage but her fresh unadulterated beauty is a breath of fresh air compared to the standard American hotties.The jokes are continuous, and much more like the TV series than the first Bean movie, no conversations here.Some particularly hilarious scenes were the bike-ride scene, the train catching scene, the restaurant scene etc.Actually this movie is filled with hilarious scenes, which will make superb trailers , and im sure this movie will be very funny even when watched with breaks on TV.The adherence to the TV series unfortunately is also this movies greatest flaw.This movie is very, very predictable even for first time viewers of bean, let alone the fans.This sort of buffoonery culminated in uncontrollable laughter by the time an episode of bean ended but its difficult to digest this for over an hour. Luckily the movie is only 90 mins long.Still i feel with better company this movie would have seemed hilarious throughout BUT EVEN AFTER I HAD LOST INTEREST THERE WAS A COUPLE OF SCENES IN THE END THAT I REALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD.If you don't find this movie funny its about time you found your inner child (or something like that in psychological mumbo-jumbo).Acting, direction and other technical aspects were surprisingly superb, with great sound editing, visuals, etc.In all a superb movie for the family especially with children and good even for the older audiences.A must watch especially for a change!!-s very predictable even for first timers, momentum is lost a bit towards the middle of the end (hehe).+/-s none pure and simple comedy involving non-complex themes.+s very simple themes, large number of hilarious scenes can be watched with any number of breaks, perfect for the families, Super cute Emma, technically superb (still surprised).total 7/10 (not factoring in that it exceeded expectations but or that i saw it with wrong company I would like to nominate this movie as a perfect film to watch for families with children, and for adults to learn that even clean movies can be great fun.)","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","MplusA92","16 July 2018","This is a movie about Mr.Bean in a different experience and totally different theme, he is out of the frame of his daily activities which we used to see in his series, and the good thing that his soul and sense of humor are still the same.The idea is very simple about Mr.Bean travelling in a journey to Cannes, and the events follow a single line which is the pathway of Mr.Bean's journey and his interactions and events throughout the journey.The type of comedy here is not different than we see in the series,which depends mainly on the situations and his face reactions other than a verbal told joke, the density of comedy is moderate and could be more by adding more events and extend the movie a little bit as you may get the feeling that it's extended episode of the series.The photography is great and you will have the chance to watch new angles of Paris and Mr.Bean,the sound effects are not noticeable here, all the other actors played their roles perfectly.Finally, it's a good and light comedy movie without any extra effort to impress, it's very enjoyable and can get you out of a bad mood easily.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Steamcarrot","31 March 2007","The final outing for Mr Bean provides a chortlesome 90 minutes. Never hilarious, but always amusing. There is a slight deviation from the usual Bean characterisation and he comes across more Tati-ish, which is somewhat fitting considering the locations, although there is no satire present. Luckily there is little plot to be found, which is exactly right for this type of film and the film ambles along from one mishap to the next culminating in the totally expected sugary outcome. In a way, it's a shame it's the last Bean (if Atkinson is to be believed) as the cinema does need more of these gentle comedies that only the British seem capable of producing, and very rarely at that. On the whole, while it'll never set the world alight it's a decent enough flick that I think will improve when it transfers to the small screen, Bean's natural home.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Robert_duder","30 September 2007","Okay it's not that I'm not a Mr. Bean fan. I just can't say that I honestly ever watched him or sat through any major length films or stories about him but obviously being a cultural phenomenon I knew about him and the brilliant comedic style of Mr. Rowan Atkinson. So I felt like this was my last shot to see Mr. Bean in all his glory since rumor has this as his last outing. I wasn't disappointed by any means and at the same time I wasn't really blown away or impressed. The best thing I could come up with as I left the theater was it was...'cute.' That's exactly what it was. A clean little chuckle with silly antics which made that character and Rowan Atkinson famous. Maybe I just don't fully appreciate or understand the humor but I chuckled but never really laughed if that makes sense. The story was pretty weak because it doesn't ever really need a story. The whole thing revolves around Atkinson lovable and naive character. But can you really drag out a skit about a lovable fool for an hour and a half? I mean by the end aren't you just kind of tired of it. I mean it's kind of the same gag over and over again isn't it? Still it had it's moments. Unfortunately for Mr. Bean's Holiday it fell victim to a very common comedy trap. The best and funniest parts were played in the trailers and played and played and played and by the time they come up...you've seen them so many times that they aren't funny anymore.How can I truly comment on Rowan Atkinson's performance. He is Bean. The man has the role down to a science and Bean is adorable and funny and naive and a little foolish but Atkinson knows how to bring his fans in and bravo to him for that. Max Baldry joins Atkinson as his sidekick...maybe a new Bean for a new generation? His performance is decent enough and his facial expressions and comedic timing is excellent. He may have a promising future ahead of him. The very lovely Emma de Caunes is Bean's love interest...sort of...as much as she could be. She is a French actress who happens to be able to give Bean a lift. She is lovely and adds some pizazz to the ensemble cast. Add a cameo by Willem Dafoe as the pontificating self obsessed director and you've got a cute little good time.Mr. Bean's Holiday attempts something of a 'big adventure' but it never really takes off quite as much as you'd expect. Everything is just kind of on a much lower scale but there is some very memorable moments including Bean's attempt at eating an enormous seafood platter, hitchhiking across the countryside, joining forces with two comrades along the way, and a very funny scene where he busks for money. I think Bean fans won't be disappointed because he definitely still knows how to bring the Bean home. Also adds some flare to see some European Countryside throughout the film. The film was done on location in England and France which I think is a nice little treat for any of us in North America especially if we have never been there because it looks beautiful. 7/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","chimera-4","20 April 2007","While this movie isn't going to win any awards it's pretty enjoyable at the level you expect from it. You know what you're getting when you go into it, lots of silly faces and sight gags, no brain required.Me and my 2 youngest kids when to see this one Saturday, one's 12 and the other one was 4. All I really wanted out of this movie was enough to keep their attention for the 90 odd minutes it was on for and it did that admirably. I even enjoyed it myself since I quite like Mr Bean. It does have to be said though that Mr Bean does what he just always does in anything else he's in really but Rowan Atkinson's obviously got it down to a fine art now and I'm not tired yet of his shenanigans. Most of the comedy comes from Bean making a complete knob of himself and generally being a major idiot. Anyone else trying to do it would likely crash and burn but Atkinson pulls it off as usual. It's a shame that Rowan Atkinson seems to have been unable to break out of the Bean mold but at least he knows he's got a home when he needs to eat.Needless to say not everyone is going to like this movie as it's quite a shallow vacuous experience really but it does do what it says on the tin. I'm also glad that there's a movie out there that tries to make you laugh without resorting to smut gags and cheap toilet humour (although it has to be said that Atkinsons other meal ticket, Black Adder is pretty much just that). Bring back the Tommy Cooper school of comedy I say.I don't know if I would have appreciated this movie as much if I'd gone to it with a bunch of my mates but looking at it from a kiddy movie point of view I was satisfied with it and the kids thought it was hilarious.

I literally didn't crack a smile from start to finish, nor did anyone else in the room. Whatever the other Bean episodes and movie had, this one hasn't got it. You'll take it back to the video store thinking ""I should have picked that other movie I was going to instead"". Truly a very sad end to the Bean franchise. Even in the original series, Bean could talk, although he didn't do so fairly often, but in this movie he seems to have been reduced to the status of retarded mute. The humor lay originally in the fact that he wasn't an idiot but saw things in a different way to the rest of us, but in Bean's Holiday, he appears to be a runaway from a sheltered workshop. It could have been oh, so, so, so good (particularly because the French, after all, provide plenty of ammunition to make fun of them with) but it completely missed the mark. I suspect Rowan Atkinson did it for the money only, write the script in an evening, and didn't do any research. It could have been filmed anywhere, with any characters, and the plot wouldn't have changed much. Pathetic, sad and very disappointed.","

However, even though I didn't see it in theaters, when I rented it, I laughed throughout the whole movie! I don't know what it is about Mr. Bean, but in every movie/episode, he makes me laugh! In this movie, Mr. Bean wins a train ticket to Cannes. But wherever Mr. Bean goes, hilarity follows! And it's not just Rowan Atkinson as the only star in it, as Willem Dafoe also appears as an egotistic film director. This may seem like a cheap family comedy at first, fortified with farts and bad jokes. Trust me, I thought that too when I saw the trailer. But once I saw the film, it was completely fart-and-corny-joke-free! It does include Mr. Bean acting childish most of the movie, and that is usually a big set off for most bad movies, but I think the key to this one is that Mr. Bean has a childish reputation, and that's what we expect! Only his reputation comes with laughs from the WHOLE audience! Don't wait any longer! Go and rent it!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","TheHonestCritic","20 September 2019","""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" (2007), this movie was a great surprise. It turned out better than I expected it to! This movie is based off the hilarious British television series ""Mr. Bean"" (1990-1995). Usually I'm not the biggest fan of movies based off television series. However, in some rare cases the adaptations work. This film is another rare example of that. It is, without a doubt, equally as good as the first film. It's also tied with the first movie as one of my top 10 all-time favorite comedy films! Perfect story, prefect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. It fires on all cylinders! The story is fun, entertaining, and of course very funny. Rowan Atkinson is once again the shining star as Mr. Bean, which is his best acting role in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, Rowan Atkinson is a brilliant actor in other movies and shows. But Mr. Bean, for me, is his signature character and his all-time best role. The rest of the cast are brilliant as well. Although, when I discovered there was a kid involved with Mr. Bean's antics I was kind of worried that he would ruin the film. But, to my surprise, Max Baldry who plays a character named Stepan is funny and charming in this film. He really accentuates Rowan's comedic performance! Emma de Caunes is brilliant as Bean's companion and potential love interest, and the rest of the side actors to a great job. The sets/locations are beautiful, England and France are always gorgeous. The soundtrack is also great, and really ties the film together. It's hard enough to make a perfect comedy film, but to do it twice in a row with this sequel is fantastic. This movie is an excellent achievement in the aspect of comedy! It's always fun to watch and it never gets old. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking for a fun, entertaining and comedic movie, then ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is the movie for you! If you have not seen it, you must check it out. When you watch it, prepare to laugh!","

This is Mr. Bean: pure and simple and is a lot more faithful to the television series than the first film was.Like the first film; 'Bean: The Movie' (1997), Mr. Bean is taken out of his surroundings and placed in a foreign country; that time it was American, this time it's France which is significant in itself because in the first film there was a plot; there were characters with likes, dislikes and relations that built up between them all: David with Bean, David with his family, Bean with the family and Burt Reynolds' character with the French. Now that Bean is in France, free flowing dialogue from characters are gone since the target audience for this film probably won't want to sit through subtitles and the overall plot is substituted for basic, humours cause and effect.Regarding the plot of the film; in the television series, a simple trip to the shops would usually end in catastrophe  now Bean has to actually board a train, get to another country and even finds time to disrupt the Cannes film festival so the recipe for disaster is only a pinch of salt away from being a masterpiece dish. The film is very reminiscent of Chaplin and in particular, 'City Lights' in the sense that Sabine (de Caunes) is the 'blind girl' that Bean befriends (she can see but Bean can't speak) and Stephan (Baldry) sort of resembles the suicidal millionaire because Bean not only saves him but helps him out more than once and a general friendship is developed. This of course twinned with the fact event after event of mis-goings on occurs supports the theory that Mr. Bean's Holiday borrows more from early Hollywood era comedy storytelling than more recent Hollywood storytelling in the form of plots, developments and epiphanies. Onto the content then and most of it works at a basic sort of level. There are no moments of real comic genius such as Seller's wheel chaired German in Dr. Strangelove or Nicholson's impression of what a 'crazy person' might do in the institute managers office in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest but some scenes work: the scrolling through of ringtones as everyone falls asleep and a lullaby theme just happens to play as everyone nods off and the way Bean doesn't realise he's on the set of a World War 2 film are two good examples of light-hearted fun that you'll enjoy if you're in the right mood.The film even manages to reference some of Britain's more classic comic moments. The scene in which Bean is trying to hitch a lift and sees a scooter approach at an extremely slow speed is reminiscent of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when John Cleese's knight charges the castle; also, Cleese is spoofed again when Bean finds himself as an extra and dressed in a Nazi uniform and 'the walk' is followed through. This is Mr. Bean's Holiday realising it's nothing spectacular but acknowledging better British comedy and tying in good jokes at the same time  its 'dig' at the Cannes film festival as a place of uptight, art film makers is particularly clever as Mr. Bean's Holiday is anything but one of these films and yet Carson Clay's (Dafoe) film written, directed and starring himself in glorious 'filling the screen' presentation could act as a sort of statement from the director that he doesn't take to these sorts of films and filmmakers.Mr. Bean's Holiday is basic but enjoyable with a good 'road movie' approach that spawns good, clean humour that most people will enjoy. The music plays an important role in the film and was particularly outstanding both as non-diegetic when Bean's 'adventures' continue and diegetic when they're either trying to busk for money or the soundtrack to Clay's film is being heard. The film moves on from one situation to another really well and despite the bizarre immediate ending, you can't help but hope Mr. Bean will take another holiday one day.","

I fully recommend people to go and watch this film if they want to watch a GOOD comedy! The parts where Bean leaves his passport on top of the phone box and gets on the train is funny, and when he loses his bus ticket and chases the chicken to get it! What a brilliant film... And the bit where he takes the speaker and dances to all the different music is REALLY funny, thanks for reading this comment and if u go watch this film i hope you really enjoy it!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","astridni","29 August 2007","Mr. Bean's Holiday is a true Mr. Bean movie. Rowan Atkinson is better than ever. To summarize, Mr. Bean wins a trip to France and in true Mr. Bean fashion, things happen, some predictable and others not. He takes the train thru France, meets a boy separated from his father, meets a beautiful woman, and things takes off from there. Throughout the film Mr. Bean excels at physical comedy in his usual self. The french landscape where the movie is filmed is beautiful to look at and one longs for next trip to France. The plot is enjoyable, but unreal. This is a movie to watch when you want to relax, have a couple of laughs, and forget about the outside world. It's worth the price of the movie ticket, but will be a worthwhile DVD rental as well.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","lukepic123","16 April 2007","This kind of thing usually works in a Bean movie, with actions expressing what is going on. But, after watching the first film it was odd without the jokes coming from other characters which also helps the movie. Moving away from the first movie, this film is fun and less rude than its predecessor (no sexual jokes or hospital operations performed by Bean) which is a lot better for kids. It's nice to see a different approach to Bean with a kid in the supporting role which actually worked well here (which was very surprising). Every Bean movie has to have Teddy and sadly HE WAS NOT FEATURED which is a shame for the Bean finale and one critical scene which was featured in the advert when Bean fills his coffee up from the broken laptop is funny but never made the final cut in the movie for some reason (proberly because Sony sponsored it and it doesn't make their laptops look robust) stupid advertising. No matter, Mr Bean's Holiday is a great family adventure which will suit children of all ages. Instead of taking the mick out France as done in Johnney English they have given it a promotive look instead. In conclusion I personally enjoyed the first Bean the best but this is still a decent Bean addition but in my view not a finale to Bean, he deserves one more film (with Teddy). All the best to review readers!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","PedanticEditor","29 December 2007","Let me just start off by saying that he shouldn't have re-used old jokes from the show yet again. Beyond that, the first part of the movie (before he meets the boy) was actually entertaining and managed to keep a consistent feel with the character. The middle of the movie, although beautifully shot in classical European fashion, seemed to alternate between letting Mr. Bean be funny and attempting to hurry through the plot in such a way that any intended humorous moments seem forced; I am referring to such scenes as where Mr. Bean was trying to entertain the boy on the train with gags that were not only severely re-used, but also inappropriate for that situation or the scene where he was doing his odd form of busking, that concept had already been done in a much sillier fashion on the television program. After the first stretch of scenes with the boy, Mr. Bean is back on his own for a while, but despite a marked improvement for the remainder of the movie, doesn't seem to regain his full potential for being silly- 'though I suspect this is due to the limited time allotment given for a feature length film. They do manage to introduce a female character in a somewhat graceful fashion, a thing which is rare in comedies, and avoid doing anything really dumb with her.I occasionally wondered why his teddy bear made no appearance, but I suppose that after his luggage left him so did the aforementioned bear.Lastly I would just say that this is waaay better than the first movie. It has a much more European feel, it has more humor, less of the jokes are old re-used ones, Mr.Bean isn't forced to talk much, and (aside from the first encounter with the boy) is much more up beat. I hope this isn't really the last we'll see of Mr Bean movies, they're just starting to get good. As for the ending, it was strangely edited, but I liked it.","

I beg to differ.Yes, this movie has the same Bean-ism as any other Mr. Bean movie. However, it also has a good under-story. And isn't the reason we watch a ""Mr. Bean"" movies is to watch Mr. Bean? If you don't like Mr. Bean movies, then don't watch them. Don't criticize something you don't like in the first place.This is the BEST Mr. Bean episode I have ever seen. I have watched some of the series and have also watched the movies. This is the best... and unfortunately the last (so I've read).The shot switching between Mr. Bean's camera and the theatrical camera was really cool. It helped put us in Mr. Bean's shoes.I don't have any ""down"" comments off the top of my head. So, the positive review remains the same. Very good movie. A must see....","

If you don't find the Mr. Bean character funny, don't bother watching this movie or commenting on it. I don't think anyone who likes the character could not have found the movie funny. For those who find the Mr. Bean character funny, this movie was really good.Throughout the movie, Mr. Bean uses his video camera to record things that happen to him on his vacation. This leads to a scene in the movie that had me laughing so hard I was crying. I really enjoyed this movie and it's safe to bring your kids too! Sit back and enjoy a fun little trip with Mr. Bean.","

Using a borrowed import DVD I proceeded to abuse myself until a friend called and I ran off to help her out. Well made but painfully annoying story of Bean winning a trip to the South of France. Is it any wonder that the French are snippy when we abuse them with films like this. Rowan Atkinson looks psychotic and his behavior is even worse. Never a big Bean fan I was curious about the film because I had heard some good things about it. What film did these people see? There is nothing good about the film and the antics of Bean are forced and obvious. My brother left me the DVD yesterday and when I asked him about it later (his wife is a huge Bean fan and was dying to see it) he said that they had shut it off 20 minutes in because they found it annoying and stupid. I did about the same, but only because I had to leave...I mean because you know me I love bad movies. yea right, there are fun bad movies and then there is this. I can't really consider this a review because I probably should have hung in there to see if it got better.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Buddy-51","26 July 2009","How much you'll enjoy ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" will depend in large part on your tolerance for Rowan Atkninson, a rubber-faced comedian who, with his broad physical humor and near-wordless pantomime, hearkens back - in style if not in quality - to the silent greats like Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, etc.In this installment, the British Mr. Bean wins the top prize in a local raffle - an all-expenses-paid trip to the French Riviera. The movie chronicles the havoc he leaves in his wake both on the way to his destination and in the South of France itself, culminating in a major ruckus at the Cannes Film Festival, no less (this is the best part of the movie, actually).The problem is that none of it really plays very well as comedy. After what feels like the longest credit sequence in motion picture history, Mr. Bean launches into a French restaurant bit that Lucille Ball had already done to perfection fifty years earlier. Things don't get much better from that point on, as Bean races from one pratfall-ridden disaster to another throughout the course of the movie. And, when all else fails, the filmmakers throw a hapless youngster - a boy who gets accidentally separated from his father at a train station - into the mix to turn this into Atkinson's own version of ""The Kid."" Mr. Bean may be funny to some, but to me he's just annoying and creepy - the visual equivalent of nails on a chalkboard perhaps. The grunting and groaning and monosyllabic muttering become unendurable over time, and the constant facial twitching and mugging for the camera don't do much to endear us to the character - or to the performer, for that matter - either.As a source of laughter, this Bean character is certainly an acquired taste and I'm perfectly willing to concede that there is something in all this labored farce that I simply don't relate to. To each his own, I suppose.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Leofwine_draca","6 March 2019","MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the second of the BEAN movies and an improvement over the original BEAN, which was just a weak re-tread of some scenes from the classic series. This film sees Bean as a tourist in France, getting up to the usual kinds of mischief. It starts out on a strong footing (although the video camera stuff gets tiring pretty quickly) and the restaurant scene is a classic, but things begin to drag after that point. The tag-along kid is more than annoying and the decision to have Bean talking is a really bad one. My advice? Stick with the original series, it's much, much better.","

Mr. Bean has become a classic character in this world. You have to like this sort of humor, or else you won't like this movie. I like to describe this film as: How can you have so much bad luck, even though it is your own fault ? It's unbelievable what Bean must be going through. I can surely recommend it. And for the people who don't like his humor, I can please you, because this film is not only the crazy faces of Bean, but also other sorts of jokes. And I want to add that the story is kind of silly, but you laugh so much that you won't even notice it. A last notice: You have to listen to the music, it's fantastic and it fits the film perfectly !My rating: A definitely earned 9/10But don't mind my commentary: Just go, see it and enjoy !

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Theo Robertson","23 March 2014","Coming out ten years after the original Bean feature film a lot of water has passed under a lot of bridges , so much so that you may have forgotten just how successful the original film was . If it was a case of milking cash cows then in the preceding ten years we might have had five sequels within in that time . That said it's pretty obvious that Atkinson , Curtiss and co haven't been spending ten years developing this screenplay but it's functional . The problem is that comedy isn't a natural genre for feature length hence we get a rather episodic choppy feel to this film as Mr Bean takes a trip to the French Riviera and finds himself caught up in a loosely plotted story that eventually sees him end up at the Cannes film festival . The jokes come thick and fast and are very hit and miss but I often found myself smiling at the situations even though I was more than capable of working out what the pay off to the jokes were going to be . The highlight of the film is Willem Dafoe as Carson Clay , an egocentric and pretentious film maker and perhaps with hindsight we could have seen a bit more of his feature film "" Without you I am nothing , nothing , nothing . Everday I'm reminded of my life without you , Empty , there is nothing , nothing , nothing "" Hardly a classic piece of comedy cinema MR BEAN'S HOLIDAY is engaging enough to pass the time","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","MaxBorg89","25 April 2007","As an actor, British comedian Rowan Atkinson has consciously divided his career in two chunks: a brilliant leading man on TV (Blackadder, Mr. Bean) and an equally memorable supporting player on the big screen (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually). When he tried to transfer his most famous creation, the mumbling, idiotic Mr. Bean, to the movies, the result was uneven, but still watchable. Ten years on, however, it appears that even Atkinson is getting tired of playing the same guy over and over again, and it shows in this movie, which he has promised will be (thankfully) the last screen appearance of Bean.This time, the absurdly stupid Englishman gets a chance to upset the French, as he wins a trip to Cannes at the same time as the famous film festival occurs (June, according to the filmmakers - whatever). Of course, being who he is, he's barely off the plane when he starts acting weird: whether he's proving he can't eat oysters properly or doesn't speak the language at all (he thinks the French expression for saying ""thank you"" is ""gracias""), Bean is a walking disaster, and as such his misadventures should be hilarious.Sadly, that's not the case, as most of the gags are repeated from the first movie, and the remaining ones aren't that original. There are a few exceptions (the restaurant scene, Bean hitchhiking, the entire Cannes section), but overall Mr. Bean's Holiday is a tired, flaccid sequel. Crucially, even the leading man seems to have lost interest in the character, and therefore Atkinson's performance is mostly a one-dimensional pantomime, leaving it to the supporting actors to save the day. Luckily Willem Dafoe, playing a narcissistic director, manages to use his all too brief screen time to perfection, confirming (after his role in Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic) his talent is not limited to playing villains. Pity he shows up pretty late in the movie, meaning the most impatient viewers might walk out and therefore miss the good stuff in an otherwise sub-par film.5,5/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","dsayne","10 September 2007","Having never before seen Mr Bean on TV or film I was prepared for the worst, my whole impression of the character coming from the obnoxious antics portrayed in advertisements. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! The character of Mr Bean is much less annoying than I had believed, and the story was very interesting and entertaining. In fact, I found myself in the familiar world of silent comedy.Now this is not a silent film. There is music, sound effects, and dialogue, but it functions in the same way that the great silent films do, requiring the separation of the viewer from everyday reality and subsequent acceptance of the lead character's premise.Rowan Atkinson has created a character in the tradition of the great silent comedians; that is, a character that is only believable in the context of the imagined world of the film itself. In most of the great silent films of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, etc, the characters were manifest exaggerations of certain select human characteristics. Hence Chaplin's magnification of the perpetual underdog, Lloyd's personification of the boy-next-door, and Keaton's understated depiction of the second-string accidental hero. None of these persons could exist in the real world to the degree that they exist in the film world. The Character of Mr Bean is even more extreme.Mr Bean, it seems, is not just socially inept, he is actually a social cripple; so much so that he is only just barely able to even speak. At first glance the character and his mannerisms are so outlandish that he is stridently irritating. His behavior is actually grotesque in such a way that it is both repulsive and compelling at the same time. As one continues to watch, however, it becomes subtly apparent that Mr Bean reacts to every situation in much the same way as any average person would, with the exception that his reactions are absurdly exaggerated. Therefore, when he wins a trip he is not just excited and pleased, he is overcome with rapturous glee; and when confronted with an unpleasant meal his attempt to deal with the situation politely results in bizarre and surrealistic antics. In fact, that is the very essence of the character. He is a SURREAL individual coping with a REAL world.The situation that Mr Bean finds himself dealing with, helping a boy who has become separated from his father, is very much like something that Keaton or Chaplin might have dealt with, and the story proceeds along similar lines. The main difference is in how the character handles the situation. Mr Bean is the opposite of the ""Great Stone-face"". While Keaton could handle anything thrown at him in a resignedly calm way, Mr Bean's actions are draped with extravagant emotion. Once the viewer becomes accustomed to the parameters it is quite engrossing.The other major difference between Bean and the great silent comedians is that all of the other characters in the story are realistic. In the silents most secondary characters tended to to be one dimensional caricatures. In Bean's world even the girl is sensible and competent. She actually assists Mr Bean in a real way, a favor which he will return in his own inept way. In Keaton's world she would have surely added to his burden and only his own actions would have saved the day.Whether Keaton, Chaplin, Lloyd, or Bean(Atkinson) the logic remains the same; only the stylistic reaction is changed. Anyone who enjoys the old silent clowns will surely ""get"" this movie. Anyone who expects a typical cheap comedy may be left scratching their head. In my own opinion Rowan Atkinson has created a minor work of art!","

He could pick up a penny and be funny. The holiday scenario was a good choice and I had never ending chuckles to laughter throughout the movie. The characters chosen were good and the language barriers a fun extra. As usual Mr Bean tries to help everyone he sees and always puts himself in turmoil whilst doing so. Again he creates as much disaster as he avoids and one wonders why he leaves his house at all. This simplest of journeys turns into a fun ride through laughter, and the actual travel scenery and events make it real (well as real as it could get). So hop on board this fun Mr Bean adventure and laugh and cry though the journey.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jboothmillard","7 April 2007","It was ten years since we saw the bumbling character takeover America, and very well, and this is the sequel I for one was looking forward to. Basically Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) attends a church raffle where there is a chance to win a holiday to the French Cannes, and he wins! So he starts his journey to the South of France, and there starts the mayhem. In his quest to the Cannes beach, he films all his exploits with his video camera, but he is soon stuck with French youth Stepan (Max Baldry) after his father, French director Emil (Karel Roden) loses him. Bean is now trying to help the boy find his Dad. Along the way they are also accompanied by Mini (looking like his) driving French actress Sabine (Emma De Caunes). He also keeps running into new film director Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe) trying to make and promote his new (and really boring) film, Playback Time. Also starring The League of Gentlemen's Steve Pemberton. There may be many giggly moments with Bean's silly nature, but it is sadly not as energetic (or chatty) as the first film. Rowan Atkinson says this will be the last adventure for his character that we have come to love since 1990, fair enough. Worth watching!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Monstrel","4 January 2008","I am a big fan of Mr. Bean, but this movie was just boring. I expected better humor and more of Charlie Chaplin style tricks, that Mr. bean is usually so good with.This time Mr. Bean was himself, but he did not have much much of a show. Plus people around him looked unusually gloomy and boring (especially the Russian father and Carson Clay). The humor was plain and of a very low (not funny) level.The part of the reason, I guess, is that too many people of different nations gathered around Mr. Bean. They do not understand each other, and Mr. Bean just doesn't care. It is difficult to create a good humor here, since all comedy is getting on the level of sign language.I think that the movie with similar plot - ""Vacation"" with Chevy Chase - was much funnier than ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"".I gave this movie 4 stars, just because of Mr. Bean's incredible mimics.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","tombeaman","26 August 2007","Mr. Bean's Holiday is a great family movie. While one cannot expect the same type of laughs you would get from The Simpsons, Animal House, or Police Academy, it is creative and watchable, albeit predictable.Bean is a singular character: he rarely has positive interactions with the various people around him. As such, his range of experiences is limited: he cannot really establish a situational humor based on a relationship. Instead, his gags must, by definition, be based on the LACK of said relationship. Because of this, many people will pan Bean because it is ""predictable"" or it ""has been done to death."" Both of this comments have merit, but if those familiar with the character suspend these issues, the movie is truly enjoyable.Bean's escapades have been summarized in other posts, so I won't go into detail here. I will say that it took me until the film was almost over to notice the recurring appearances of characters, which is quite funny in itself. Keep your eyes open on those passing faces, for they often appear again later, as the same character, as if they are all following Bean on his journey.I'd say the biggest problem in the film is the sentimentality that emerges between the attractive female lead and Bean. Let's be realistic: no one who looks as good as she does is going to be so quick to adopt a person as quirky as Bean...and I'm not just focused on his appearance.Rowan Atkison has done a great job with this character, and if this is truly Bean's last harrah, it is a good way to say ""adios"".","

If anyone knows anything about the soundtrack, or where to get the tune from the beginning of the movie, give me a message, Cheers, Craig :)","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","coachie","24 March 2007","Saw the preview today (24 March 2007) in S Wales. I can only hope it's not the final version.I really wanted to laugh, but couldn't. The plot was thinner than a watered down bowl of minestrone soup. The cinema was shrouded with silence when there should have been howls of laughter. They even cut the scene from the trailer where Bean spills his coffee over a laptop whilst on the train (my disappointed 7 year old daughter spotted that). My 3 year old son fell asleep half way through.The only highlights for were the moped-jacking, the market dancing/opera sketch and Antoine de Caunes' daughter.Why did they postpone the US release until September?This will be out on DVD faster than a dodgy oyster can work its way through your digestive system.Unfortunately it follows the old adage - Good trailer, Sh*te film.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","SnoopyStyle","1 January 2015","Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) wins a church raffle for a vacation trip to the south of France and a camcorder. This allows him to cause havoc in an another country. He accidentally separates Emil and his son Stepan. Emil is a movie critic going to Cannes as Film Festival jury member. Bean and Stepan are together when Bean lose their tickets, wallet and documents. They get thrown off the train and have to find their way to Cannes themselves.Bean is normally more selfish and obnoxious. The movie pairs him up with a kid and he becomes a good-hearted bumbling fool. The humor becomes a lot lighter. The chances were that Bean would have trouble staying funny for the longer duration. This light stuff has a lot of difficulties maintaining any comic intensity. Also the kid should probably be a bit younger to get more of the cute factor. Nevertheless, there are some fun bits that make this a worthwhile watch for fans of the TV character.","

Well, we did just that. A laugh. In fact there might have been 3. Even the kids who were watching it with their parents only managed about 3 laughs. I warn you all, this is the most dire film you could ever go and see. The storyline was predictable, and even though that's the whole point of Mr Bean, it was even more so than usual...so much so that it just wasn't even funny.The French actress was the only thing that kept me going. She was beautiful and actually a good actress. Willem Defoe, who is usually extremely good, was only average.got to say if I'd got this out on DVD it would have been turned off after 10 minutes and returned. Don't waste your breathe.Very sorry Mr Atkinson. I think you are a comedy genius but this did not hit the mark...and a cinema full of people where I was would say the same, kids and adults alike.Miss it, you won't be missing out.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","TxMike","2 January 2008","I think Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean is at his best in short, stand-alone skits that most of us know him for. While I thought he was pretty good in 'Johnny English, here it just never seems to come together. But the teenagers loved it.Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean wins the church raffle for a video camera and a trip to the french Riviera. On his way nothing goes as it should, all because of his own haplessness. On the way he hooks up with a young boy, stranded when his dad missed the train (blame Mr Bean, of course) and later a young actress Sabine (pretty French Emma de Caunes) after Mr Bean messes up a movie shoot because he has to ""save"" her.So, much of the movie becomes a road trip of sorts, down through France, to see if the boy can be reunited with his dad, while the cops are searching for the 'kidnappers', and to see if Sabine can make it to Cannes in time for her movie.Willem Dafoe is an interesting character, Carson Clay, who writes, directs, produces, and stars in self-indulgent films. Overall a very so-so movie, worth a few laughs for Mr Bean fans. Anyone not a Bean fan will surely not enjoy it.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","kevin_robbins","8 November 2022","Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007) is a movie that my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows our friend Bean who wins a holiday vacation on a game show. As he heads off on his adventure a series of hijinks follow from picking up a random kid, to losing his wallet and everything in between. Can Bean return the kid to his family and find a way to enjoy his adventure?This movie is directed by Steve Bendelack (The Harry Hill Movie) and stars Rowan Atkinson (Johnny English), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), Lily Atkinson (Johnny English Reborn) and Steve Pemberton (Killing Eve).There was so much to like about this movie. The little boy was a great supporting character to Bean and was hilarious. Every face slap scene was tremendous and had me cracking up. There were several classic Bean moments - the wallet sequence, the money begging scene and the movie theatre closing were all wildly entertaining. The budget for this must have been solid because the war scene was outstanding, and Dafoe was a great nemesis.Overall, this was another fun Bean picture that was better than the Johnny English movies but not as good as the Bean series. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","neil-476","13 March 2010","No Mr Bean film is ever going to be a classic of anything. Conversely, any Mr Bean film is going to centre around a character who is a small child in adult's clothing, and most of the humour is going to derive from his inability to behave according to the adult mindset.Mr Bean behaves like an irresponsible idiot - as usual - in this colourful, comical trek across France.The situations are daft, but there are lots of chuckles and some laugh out loud moments (the dancing in particular shows off Atkinson's ability to do physical humour, not used as often as it might be).Emma de Caunes is cute.Willem Dafoe enters into the spirit of things with a vengeance.This is an enjoyable and amusing film, suitable for the whole family.","

Mr. Bean wins a trip to the beaches of Cannes but when he asks a random stranger to video tape his departure onto the train he accidentally separates a father and son. Just one random act of stupidity after another with no story or care. Arriving ten years after the pitiful first film, director Steve Bendelack does his best but comes away with virtually a longer version of what is seen on TV. Rowan Atkinson plays Bean as a sort of homage to silent stars and his antics work a tad better here than in the previous film. His raffle ticket setup for the vacation is amusing but from there it is the basic plot weighted by antics. His dealing with the film reel at Cannes in the conclusion adds a bit of humanity that works. Emma De Caunes is wasted as an actress who picks up Bean. She is making her film debut and must get to Cannes. Willem Dafoe plays a frustrated director in what is a major fall for an actor capable of much better. Max Baldry plays the boy whom Mr. Bean will reunite with his father, as if we couldn't predict that. The TV program featuring Mr. Bean is so much better and funnier than this. This holiday is a complete waste of time. Score: 3 ½ / 10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","samglin","25 August 2007","Mr. Bean's Holiday hasn't gotten very good reviews here with people mostly saying it is simply not funny, is the same old same old, blah blah blah, milking the franchise for all it's worth... I for one really enjoyed the old episodes of the Mr. Bean TV show but hated the first Mr. Bean film (where he went to LA). This movie lies somewhere in the middle. Not nearly as funny as the show with the same kind of humour just not as funny, but also much better and more funny than the first Bean movie. Also worth noting that it's the same humour as the TV series but I've seen all the episodes and thankfully none of the gags are simply recycled. It really is at least ten times better than its 1997 predecessor (which has nothing to do with this film thank goodness). I would recommend it as a rental or to see on TV, but if you are having a family movie night this would be a great choice, it's better than most movies and won't offend any families (of course not, it's Mr. Bean!) It's a feel-good movie that is not so sappy it would make you puke which is rare, I think. Willem Dafoe was funny and Rown Atkinson was FANTASTIC, he did not mail this in at all, and if I may say he does not seem much older than he ever did as this character. Well worth checking out if your expectations aren't too high.","

I remember having an old series of episodes of him and watching them over and over and laughing at his ridiculousness. That was a long time ago. When I found out this movie was made, I was actually a bit excited. I wanted to see Mr. Bean on the big screen. Overall, I liked it. I didn't love it, I didn't bow before it, I didn't cry tears of happiness. I liked it. There are some funny moments. But this movie had some things that really seemed to bother me. 1.) Too many subtitles! I know he's in France and all, but I know many kids who have seen this movie. Not all kids can read very well. And there aren't just a few subtitles here and there, they are common in this movie! 2.) Common Sense lost I know it's a comedy movie, but some people's common sense in this film really annoyed me. I don't want to go into detail, but there were many things scenes where common sense should have happened....but it didn't.Anyway, I liked this film. I would rent it. It's a good summer film, too.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Juan_from_Bogota","7 May 2007","I really had a good time watching Mr. Bean TV series and the first movie, but in this one i felt that Mr. Bean needed to finish, the movie shows a character that has nothing to add, he forget things, he can't speak, he is lonely and very dumb. The movie pull out of me some laughs, yes, but as a whole, the movie is somewhat depressing, boring and for a comedy it could have been more funny. The end of the movie is some kind of nostalgic, happy ending for the saga. Well is the end of Mr Bean but maybe we will have a second Johny English?, we'll see. I liked specially the scene where Bean sings as an opera female mother who lost her son, great! Rowan Atkinson acting is great and he show that he dominates the Mr. bean character well. But the movie only could get 3 stars for my personal rating.ABOUT THE FILM: Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) here won on a raffle to take some vacation to Cannes and also a video camera, on his way to this beaches in the south of France, he start to have comic situations, when he arrived to Paris, he needed to take a train to Cannes, at the Gare Du Lyon, he ask to some man (Karel Roden) to take some shots of him when he was stepping in the train, there were needed so many shots that the guy lost the train, this man actually was an important filmmaker from Russia that headed to Cannes film festival; he was also with his son Stepan (Max Baldry), who was in the train waiting for him. Bean then start a quest with Stepan to meet his father, with a lot of inconveniences, Bean became suspect of kidnapping the boy; on the way Bean finds himself in the filming of some commercial directed by the important director Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe), who also headed to Cannes and the beautiful actress Sabine (Emma De Caunes), who helped Bean on the way. The story show places and funny situations when Mr. Bean objective was only to finally get to the beach.3/10","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","theumpteenthtimes","31 January 2011","My reasoning for not expecting much from Mr. Bean's Holiday was twofold: Firstly, I hated Bean, the first film of this series. It's cliché story was embarrassing and excessively Hollywood for a film based on a British television program. Also, in between a narrative I neither cared for or paid attention to, were all the same gags I had already seen on the television show (Remember Mr. Bean getting his head stuck inside the turkey?). Unlike the Kids in the Hall movie, Brain Candy and Beavis and Butthead Do America, this film did not bring anything new to the table beyond what television had already given us.My second reason for not expecting Mr. Bean's Holiday to be worthwhile was it's title. It's obviously a tribute to the Jacques Tati film, Mr. Hulot's Holiday, the story of a Bean-like character's often hilarious romp through a vacation spot, causing chaos and mayhem amongst society's elite. Rowan Atkinson has cited Tati as a major influence for the Mr. Bean character and has even pointed out this film specifically as his masterpiece. Knowing this going into Mr. Bean's Holiday, I assumed the film would entail Rowan Atkinson performing Jacques Tati beat by beat. I couldn't have been more wrong.Surprisingly, I found Mr. Bean's Holiday to be more of a Chaplin-esque version of Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Though the Tati influence is always apparent in the character of Mr. Bean, the gags in the film were some we haven't seen in over eighty years, paying homage to Chaplin more than anyone else, though there is some Buster Keaton in there as well.The film begins with Mr. Bean winning a trip to Cannes at a church raffle. After a stop in Paris, along with a series of mishaps, Mr. Bean finds himself stuck at a train station in the middle of France, without his passport and with a child that does not speak English (or whatever language it is Mr. Bean speaks). Reminiscent of Chaplin's The Kid, the scenes between Mr. Bean and the child are some of the funniest, mostly because the language barrier opens up for Atkinson the possibility to do what he does best as the lovable character, communicate without words. Though it's a craft developed and sharpened by such geniuses as Chaplin and Keaton many years ago, nowadays, in a cinematic world in which most comedies are overflowing with poorly written jokes and the corniest of punchlines, it's refreshing to once again be amused by the lifting of an eyebrow or the wiggling of an ear. But Atkinson does more than that. He pushes the physical limitations of every scenario to the brink without seeming too ""cartoony,"" as would most likely be the case if it were a Jim Carrey comedy. Like Chaplin's Tramp character, there is a sweet, tender side to Mr. Bean that is undeniable and is the backbone of our attraction. Even when Mr. Bean is inconsiderate, as is the case when he pours the inside of clamshells into a woman's purse, we can't help but sympathize since he seems to be put in a position where he doesn't have any other recourse.William Defoe is amusing as the self-absorbed filmmaker who not only kicks Bean off the set of a commercial shoot but also instigates the final chase scene in Cannes as well. Ultimately, however, his character only serves the function of a nemesis and nothing more. Like the love interests in a Marx Brothers film, it is crucial for the sake of storytelling but not crucial to the story.The story, in the end, is about the survival of a character who is truly an original, battling the limitations of society. Like Mr. Hulot, as well as Pee Wee Herman, The Tramp, and many other characters through the history of film, Mr. Bean endures because of his unique way of life, the unique manner he chooses to approach conflict, and his uncanny knack to achieve his goals, despite his, as well as society's, shortcomings.","

Always knows how to make me seriously laugh out loud.I personally think the film would have been funnier as a not so simple vacation rather than the boy separated from his father bit.

You either like Mr Bean or hate him and iv always been a fan of his.The first film i thought was hilarious with Bean travelling to LA for an art gallery BUT id say this film is better than that one, in the first film there was probably abit too much dialogue but in this one there's some gr8 examples of silence that hav been wonderfully directed to make a gr8 film.This film was defiantly more like the TV series and yes there'll be ppl saying ""But is the same slapstick humour"" but you're not gunna change something that worked so well.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","screenman","4 July 2008","As a Rowan Atkinson fan - especially in his 'Blackadder' role - I was hoping for big things from this movie. 'Mr Bean' the series was less funny, but Atkinson still had enough appeal and ingenuity to make the idea of a completely out-of-this-world dimwit work for half an hour.Unfortunately; it didn't translate to the big screen - not for me at any rate. From the outset, I found the visual gags corny in the extreme. And it just went from bad to worse.I've seen the 'Two Ronnies' do this kind of visual comedy many times before and they were really funny. They were funny in a way that Atkinson can only dream of. It was entirely appropriate that for so much of the movie his companion was a child. Only children could fit the role of players against the preposterously juvenile scenarios into which Mr Bean was immersed.About a third of the way through, I gave up. It was simply too embarrassing to go on watching such sub 'Carry On' farce.This is strictly for die-hard Rowan Atkinson fans only. Lovers of superior comedy such as 'Blackadder' will grieve at its utter predictability and lack of wit.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","AndreiPavlov","7 November 2012","If you enjoy watching a little brat slapping an old man in the face - it's your type of comedy.Suppose many people on this planet (judging by the gross income of $183,956,926 worldwide according to IMDb) are ready to pay tons of money for the wrong depiction of foreign culture. Or at least the director of this flick did not bother to find out a few basic things before shooting this mess of a movie. Russian people never slap people in the face on meeting. NEVER. So, showing a Russian kid slapping Bean in the face is one of the stupidest things to witness. Well, maybe it was made for laughs? Not to me. Rowan Atkinson, representing an aging dim-witted person, is even trying to express some kind of delight during this kind of ""Hello!"" rite. It looks cheap, vulgar, and fictitious. Even disgusting. A sheer example of how a straw can ruin the whole production. Any other things? Let's get started.Rowan Atkinson in this one looks old. Jumping about, making the same stupid faces (cf. ""Bean""), etc. makes a viewer feel disillusionment and pity for the actor. Especially if you see it all in the scenes where a vile kid is present too. Do you remember Mr Charles Chaplin? In his later movies he did not try the same ""kick-in-the-butt"" tricks but achieved the new heights, still keeping his unique style of comedy - THAT was craftsmanship.The original ""Bean"" movie was real (the same is true to ""Mr Bean"" the series), that's what was so important to me. Mad, bizarre, outrageous, disastrous, but at the same time very true to life. Every single scene was believable (all right, maybe, the ""Ride of Doom"" was a bit OTT). But here you see Bean being locked inside a wooden closet on the road and a big truck smashes it to pieces off-screen, and Bean gets away with it safe and sound. They make a superman out of our beloved down-to-earth Bean. If you want an incomprehensive comedy with undying heroes you watch ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"" or ""Toxic Avenger"" (the best choice) - correct? So this was another little feature that ruined the movie for me.Another point. A question of love and male-female relationship. Bean is a character, who is supposed to be a nerd from top to toe. And what do we see here? A young beautiful actress is trying hard to keep a conversation with him, to be nice and interested. Her little talks in the car are quite uncomfortable to hear. Why should she give a damn about some old freaky penniless guy who didn't even look cute? Something doesn't match here. And you feel it. It's another one to ruin the film.You need more? How about the misuse of foreign languages? When will these directors learn to get their Russian characters speak realistic Russian language? Russian characters speaking Russian with unbelievable intonations and heavy accents are irritating and not funny. Here one should recall ""Black Eagle"" (yes, one of the IMDb's low-grade – quite unjustly, if you ask me – action films) with an easy and true-to-life use of the Russian language, which was very funny to boot.One more thing, which is even more personal in perception of this flick. There is a dumb ""Oscar-like ceremony"" and a big-name actor in the role of some modern director delivers dramatic faces. Not appropriate here.The restaurant scene was all right and almost made me laugh, but, come on, we'd seen something like that in ""Bean"" the series, and it had been insane there. But here it just looks amateurish in comparison.One of the dullest comedies with many uncomfortable scenes to sit through. A 1 out of 10 (even this lowest mark cannot express my total disappointment with this flick that ruined not only itself, but Bean character as well). How dare they destroy one of the funniest on-screen characters ever? Thank you for attention.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Anonymous_Maxine","7 May 2008","I have read that this is likely to be Rowan Atkinson's last adventure as Mr. Bean, and while I did enjoy the movie and I love Bean to death, I can't say that I would be hugely disappointed if that was true. I would be sad to see Bean retire, but I think it is better to do that now, at a high point in his career, rather than keep going until he becomes genuinely tiresome. Bean runs a very specific formula, and I have never been really disappointed by a Bean show or movie (although I have to admit that the animated series does nothing for me), so it would be sad to see him, ah, overstay his welcome, I guess you could say.In Bean 2, the lovable clown wins an all-expenses paid trip to Cannes, France in a church raffle, and it is notable that all of the mayhem that takes place in the movie is as a result of Bean's perfectly innocent efforts to get to the beach in southern France. Through a truly Bean-style Series of Unfortunate Events, he ends up obliviously involved in a kidnapping and all but causes a national emergency.It is hard not to notice some of Bean's traditional skits from his old TV shows recycled into this movie (as was also the case in the first Bean film in 1997  including the turkey on the head skit, one of my least favorites), but at least they never look repetitive or cheap. The plot moves along nicely and, even with some of the more ridiculous scenes, never drags, and that means a lot in what is essentially a modern silent slapstick comedy.Willen Dafoe turns up, good-naturedly playing a wildly egotistical film director named Carson Clay, who we meet when Bean inadvertently stumbles onto his set as he's filming a commercial, and then Bean ruins/saves his horrendous self-glorifying film at the Cannes Film Festival. On the way there, Bean accidentally separates one of the Cannes judges from his son, who becomes Bean's increasingly willing sidekick for most of the film. What 12 year old kid wouldn't want to hang out with someone like Bean? Bean gets to do his old gag by trying to entertain an unhappy kid (on a train this time rather than a place), and the kid gradually opening up Bean is one of the best parts of the movie, and culminates in my favorite skit of all, when the two of them perform a dramatic interpretive dance to a moody opera as surprisingly talented street performers. Outstanding! Bean also develops something of a love interest in an unbelievably beautiful French actress named Sabine (hey, it rhymes!), who wins his heart when he sees that she drives the same Mini Cooper that Bean's truest fans will instantly recognize, and just so happens to also be on her way to Cannes, given that she has a tiny, tiny role in Clay's film, which he wrote, directed, produced, edited, stars in, etc. The screening of the film within the film is also a charming scene, as Clay leans forward in his seat, completely engrossed in and irretrievably moved by his film, which is simultaneously boring the rest of the audience to tears. This is great stuff! 12-year-old Max Baldry plays the ""kidnapped"" boy in the movie, in a great performance emulating a hugely popular and famous comedian that almost reminded me of little Jackie Coogan working beside Charlie Chaplin in The Kid in 1921. Mr. Bean's Holiday is no comparison to something like The Kid, but it is a wonderful family film that is sure to entertain, and Bean fans are also sure to love it. Not his best work, but this is good, clean fun!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","chrichtonsworld","2 May 2007","Mr. Bean is one of my favorite creations of Rowan Atkinson! The character he introduced 17 years ago was hilarious! A lot of years have passed and Bean seemed to have changed quite a bit! While ""Bean the movie"" still was funny ""Bean's Holiday"" fails miserably! Every time when there is a hint of comedy and you feel that something funny is going to happen the scene stops! And a new ""joke"" starts! This way you never get the chance to fully appreciate the few jokes that appear in this movie! Most of the humor is visual since Bean rarely speaks! But in comparison with previous Bean productions not much is happening! Sure there are some situations that are typical for Bean to experience! But there aren't many of them! It is like Rowan Atkinson was very tired to do Bean! Then why did they decide to make this movie? To me this movie was a total disappointment and never should have been made! Forget about this movie and go watch the TV series (1990-1995),if you haven't already! This series is the best Bean production ever made! Everything that is made after (including Bean's holiday) doesn't even come close to the fantastic original series!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","drqshadow-reviews","29 December 2015","Rowan Atkinson's curtain call as Mr. Bean seems like it should've happened ten years ago. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this movie, really, but it does often feel empty and spacious, like we're all just going through the motions one last time. There's a requisite number of repackaged old skits from the character's long history, interspersed within a lightly curvy, family-friendly plot. Bean's awkward natural charisma is still in attendance, despite his curmudgeonly exterior, and he plays well alongside his two costars: a nearly-mute foreign boy and a stunning French beauty. The language barrier plays well into both relationships, as many of the masthead characters' best adventures play like a silent film. It's fine, I guess, and it certainly entertained my two young boys (we've watched it dozens of times since it went up for streaming on Netflix) but there's nothing remotely essential in here and I doubt I'll remember any of it in a few weeks' time.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","alfredpr-69611","1 December 2019","This was the most laborious, unfunny expedition I ever s aw. This was a grotesque insipid nightmare of a movie, there was no charm and there was a pervasive, disagreeable dryness like eating the white segment parts of a pomegranate.
The color was basically a sickly black and white with greenish tint. The life was sucked out of this series.
Rowan Atkinson is now destitute of comedic ability, he made the equally appalling Johnny English.
Atkinson is a very ugly man but he used his rubbery swarthy face to accentuate the comedy, this was just gratuitous close ups of his misshapen visage, raising eyebrows and superfluous failed attempts at physical comedy. Just mawkish buffoonery, that comes off trite.
The magic is long gone, I just stayed with it almost to the end because of morbid curiosity, I could not believe how atrociously bland this movie was. Bean was side-splitting hilarity but this was comedy antimatter, I can not over state this point, this movie should be in the trash heaps where it belongs. This is the undeserving inheritor of the Mr. Bean fortune.
Bean died a long time ago for me.I can not over state this folks, this movie is a monumental (insert expletive) waste of film and time. Comedy demands situation, set up, this movie had none. Rowan Atkinson just thought he could romp through 90 mins performing stupid antics and he would be heralded a genius, not so!
I wish I could have cuffed Atkinson in his doughy mouth for this abomination.
Do not see this (insert expletive) waste of time. I felt shame for Atkinson.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Mysterygeneration","13 January 2024","Mr. Bean's Holiday, directed by Steve Bendelack, is a delightful and whimsical film that follows Rowan Atkinson as the beloved character Mr. Bean. The film follows Mr. Bean as he wins a trip to the French Riviera and embarks on a series of misadventures that lead to uproarious laughter. Atkinson's physical comedy and impeccable timing bring the iconic character to life, delivering moments of hilarity that resonate with fans of all ages. The film captures the essence of Mr. Bean's innocence and unintentional ability to bring joy to those around him. The picturesque backdrop of the French countryside adds to the charm, making it a delightful watch for both longtime fans and newcomers.","

Whilst not quite as good as the first film, there is no denying that Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius, nor that Mr Bean is his greatest creation.The man can communicate more with a simple facial expression than others can using a thousand words. Some of the best scenes in this film, in which Bean is the lucky recipient of a French holiday - poor old France, what did they ever do to deserve Mr Bean's visit - and a video camera to record his adventures are Atkinson's facial expressions when things go wrong. Parts are shown from the video camera's point of view, which I thought was well done, too.Naturally, there's plenty of slapstick humour with Bean in the middle of some outrageous situations. Hard not to smile, grin, chuckle and laugh.Basically, if you enjoyed the first movie and the iconic TV series, you'll enjoy Mr Bean's Holiday.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","cmon3590","3 May 2007","The jokes in this movie aren't new. We've seen them all before. I'll admit, it was a better movie than ""Bean"" or ""Johnny English"", but it was still lacking the originality in gags and plot that make a movie worth watching.Rehashing of jokes aside, I've long thought the ""Mr Bean"" style of humour doesn't translate well to the big screen. The ""Mr Bean"" character works in sketch comedy because he is so quirky and distanced from reality. He is incredibly funny, but his interactions with others are very personal - what we see is mainly from his point of view, and so his world is very specialised. This is easier to get across in a series of eccentric sketches, rather than on the big screen, as everything movie-length and movie-size has to bigger, better, shinier, etc, not ""quaint"" or introverted. Another problem with these movies, I believe, is setting. In the TV series, ""Bean"" is always in a very low-key (and again, ""quaint"") environment (middle-class London) which he is easily able to upset, though still be tolerated in. However, put him in sunny Los Angeles or avant garde France, and suddenly, nobody is prepared to indulge him any more. People just see him as some kind of freak that is getting in their way, and all the humour is killed. If ""Bean"" is not indulged, then ""Bean"" is not ""Bean"". The Python gang were able to maintain a pleasing level of intellectual absurdity while still making films like ""Holy Grail"" and ""Life of Brian"" very watchable on the big screen, however, somehow I think the ""Mr Bean"" style of humour is too obscure to be able to do that.Anyway, my advice would be not to go out of your way to see this movie .. wait for the DVD, and maybe smoke some funny cigarettes or drink lots of champagne to help the experience along. Little kids may like it, but to adults I say, be cautious, particularly if you're a genuine fan (as I am) of Rowan Atkinson's TV comedies and stage work.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","NoDakTatum","11 October 2023","Rowan Atkinson breaks out his best-known character for one final hurrah. Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a British nebbish with a funny voice and mannerisms. He is hard to describe, unless you have seen Atkinson's many television incarnations of the character, and the fun ""Bean"" film from a few years ago. He gets in harmless trouble, and is actually endearing in a sympathetic way. Bean wins a raffle for a trip to Cannes and the beaches there, and a video camera to record his trip. Of course, the trip is far from ordinary. Through his own cluelessness, he is saddled with a young Russian boy (Max Baldry) who is also headed to Cannes to meet up with his father Emil (Karel Roden), a Cannes Film Festival jury member. Bean and the boy team up to earn money and complete the trip, and Bean falls in like-like at the first sight of struggling actress Sabine (Emma de Caunes). Toss in Willem Dafoe as ego-maniacal film director Carson Clay, and this bizarre G-rated adventure plows ahead full steam.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is not laugh-out-loud shtick. I found myself smiling through most of it. The character of Bean is so loopy, even when things finally work out for him, you await the next complication- whether it be forgetfulness, or a runaway chicken. Bean does get frustrated at what life deals him, and his rare rants and fits about something that has happened are funny to watch, but then he recovers and moves on to his goal. Bendelack's direction is assured, and keeps up with Atkinson well. The screenplay moves along very quickly. There are expected set-pieces where Atkinson can work his audience, but they don't drag like they sometimes did on the television series. Bendelack, and screenwriters Hamish McColl and Robin Driscoll, seem to know right when to get out, and on to the next bit of business. Special mention goes to Howard Goodall's simply wonderful musical score. In all honesty, the biggest laugh comes courtesy of Willem Dafoe. The screening of his character's incredibly boring film, with the audience falling asleep while Clay is transfixed, is nothing short of brilliant. Having been in the movie review game most of my life, I could associate with the snoozing audience very much. ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is as good as it's inspiration, ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday,"" another film centered on a character just trying to get away from it all. It is quite an appropriate swan song for Mr. Bean, unless Atkinson changes his mind.","

There are lot of nice sceneries of South of France to see during his journey to Cannes. Perhaps there too many images from his own handy camera but it wasn't disturbing. The short running time of 86 minutes was well chosen. William Defoe was also funny in an unusual role as we know him from villain roles.After I have read the critics on IMDb I was convinced that it could work. The result is that my wife and my five year old son had really great fun. The DVD will have a place in my best of collection. Bravo Mister Bean!

Mr Bean is one of the funniest characters there is and this film really shows it.Mr Beans Holiday keeps the original Bean classic idea, where everything goes from bad to worse for Bean, making for a hilarious film, you don't know whats coming next. One of my favourite scenes is when Bean orders a huge unwanted dish of sea food in a fancy French restaurant, well, lets just say he gets rid of that in classic Bean style.One of the questions I had before seeing this was what the role of Willem Dafoe was going to be, as he seems a strange choice of actor for a Mr Bean movie, this however is answered by playing a character I did not expect him to play in this film. Bringing with him a new context into the film, creating more adventure for Mr Bean.This is definitely a film not to be missed, I have read that Rowan Atkinson has decided on this being the final Mr Bean story, well if he does change his mind, I would definitely like to see him in another Mr Bean film. Mr Bean's Holiday is a great surprise for all Mr Bean fans and is definitely worth wathching.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Zac_La_Porte","29 November 2021","Mr. Bean finally earns his own holiday movie after all the amusing events he's been through, but there's an additional truckload more of a thoughtful but weak storyline over his frequently hilarious cluelessness. The only real thing that the creators forgot to cover was that familiar style of mindless humour that the show was able to successfully produce.Rowan Atkinson is and will always be the star of the Mr. Bean tales. Although the new plot and the other new characters really go and take over his moments of cringey foolishness, the actor still brings back the exact same Bean we were hoping for. Plus, the beloved character has his moments, but unlike the clips you'd see from the show, there're not just as creative and leave out the accompanying audience-laughter sound effect.Although many things seem to fall apart, the actual plot isn't too bad. It's definitely the kind of journey you'd want to see the classic Mr. Been take roll in. There's nice themes and fun moments, and it's another movie that portrays how the actual adventure matters as much, if not more, than the simple location. It's cringey to witness large crowds singing for the camera and Willem Dafoe following Mr. Bean's filming style, but at the same time, it's also just really sweet and undeniably fun.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

This one needs help. There is just too much reliance on contorting his face and after a while that gets old. The sight gags are not new, the same old stuff. Mr. Atkinson needs to find a better script or rather he needs to re-invent himself. Whereas the comedic masters of the past can do the same thing over and over again and each time we would laugh as if seeing them for the first time, this is not the case here. The old masters had the timing thing down pat and as already mentioned, this is not the case here. Kind of sad because I like the Bean character. To be fair, if this was the first Bean movie I had seen, maybe I would feel differently and not be so critical, but this was not the first one I have seen.

I can't stop laughing at the last part, at the Cannes Film Festival! Carson Clay is pretty foolish to show such a lame movie, named ""Playback Time"" (the time it showed the title in the movie made me laugh hard, it literally played back!) at the greatest film festival in France! Mr. Bean's amateur video combination is really very very coincidental, it plays at the same pace the narration goes! The funniest part for me was when Mr. Bean accidentally pressed the fast forward button after he almost got caught in the projection room, the ""How I'm so selfish (pun for shellfish which Mr. Bean is seen in the screen with a shrimp-like seafood sticking out of his mouth)"" really made me laugh real hard (the fast forwarded one), and the ""I have to haunt you"" part (when Mr. Bean struggles to climb back to the projection room with the lights on his face which made him look like a zombie). Anyway, back to business... The film is good! Not great, if you repeatedly watch it. Sabine is indeed pretty, and familiar. Mr. Bean is still that childish type of person!

It is not really funny unless you really like that kind of thing.I'm also getting a bit distant from the character ... he's looking more and more like a ""bad"" person. He steals and ""purposefully"" damages other people's things. He is getting harder to watch.If you're a ""Mr. Bean"" fan, there are a few classic Bean moments that you simply have to see.

It's full of Mr Bean's brand of humour in this movie.The story takes places in only 3 days, about Mr Bean's unfortunate and fortunate adventures in France.I quite like how the movie introduces Mr Bean at the beginning without showing his face at all. Seeing his yellow car, his way of locking it up, his costume and his actions, one can already tell that this is a Mr Bean's movie.This movie sort of combines many elements present in his Mr Bean series in some parts of this movie. ( Eg: The part where he tries to cheer up a kid in the train, dining in restaurant, etc ) I'm sure most Mr Beans fans will be able to spot them.Overall I feel that this is a nice movie that most people of all ages will enjoy, even for people who don't understand English well.

This movie is worse than ""The Ring Thing"", which was of similar filming and acting quality, but had one big advantage: it did not take itself seriously.Especially in the second half, I laughed a lot in sheer disbelief: How could someone dare to release this crap?If you would like to watch a similar, but way better, comedy about shooting a film with no budget, and have the same low expectations in action, special effects, production values as necessary for ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", I wholeheartedly recommend ""Bowfinger"".","

Some of these experiences could have ended in a disaster for the mentally challenged individual; therefore it would have been worthwhile him investing in some travel insurance before he left the UK. In this particular circumstance this individual only goes on the occasional holiday,therefore the logical insurance for this man would be to buy insurance just for that trip rather than investing in an annual based multi trip travel insurance extravaganza. Watching Mr Bean once again reminded me of probably my favourite film of all time, Thunderbirds... The thought of Thunderbirds was so powerful that it had me eclipsed in its all encompassing nostalgic beauty.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jingvillareal","23 October 2007","If you like watching Mr. Bean on TV, and if you've seen the first movie as well, you'd find that Atkinson did nothing special in this movie. Mr. Bean is Mr. Bean and it's either you love him or you find him corny, no gray areas here. You'll see the same antics, the same absurdity and the same stupidity that would make you cringe one minute and then make you laugh yourself out of your seat the next. Personally, watching the TV series is a lot funnier because like all jokes, the sooner you get to the punchline, the better. Movies last for two hours on the average and it would be very hard to keep the audience laughing from start to finish. The build-up is crucial and the punchlines have to be delivered with as much spontaneity as possible and that in itself is hard already. Now what makes this even harder is the fact that the movie used very little dialog. The underlying plot and story had to jive with Mr. Bean's brand of comedy and at the same time Mr. Bean had to work with a 2-hour narrative structure, all the while trying to keep the acting and comedy as spontaneous and as natural as possible, even Charlie Chaplin or the three Stooges would've surely had a hard time.What made me appreciate this film is not its brand of humor, but the story itself. Behind Mr. Bean's comedic facade, absurd humor and rehashed antics, the movie boasts of an underlying story that makes it way above the first movie in terms of substance. This movie isn't shallow at all. I don't know if you saw it the way I did, but I believe the film is a critique of the independent film movement! Remember the movie's climax, where there's this highly- acclaimed art film director who was about to showcase his latest film to a highly film-literate Cannes audience, only to end up showing Mr. Bean's home video instead? And when the director thought he was ruined for sure, the crowd suddenly erupted to a standing ovation, much to his surprise. Remember that sequence? What does this say about art-films? Simply put, an art film is what the critics and the audience say it is. If it is a simple home video but the audience thinks its art, it is art. No amount of special effects, eerie soundtracks and fantastic editing can equal the magic of a filmmaker who dedicates himself and puts his all on his personal work, and Bean's video was just that, a collection of his absurd yet real adventures while going on his merry way to experience that Cannes beach vacation he won on a lottery. In the end, you'll see that same art-film director going around shooting like Mr.Bean, as if saying that filmmakers and directors today do just that - they don't make use of their own styles, they simple apply the styles that work in making their films. That is what I think the director of this film tells us with Mr. Bean's holiday. This film is not something he plans to see at Cannes nor is this film a simple clone of the first Bean movie. He knows his craft and he wants to tell us that he is simply doing his thing without using past Mr. Bean formulas that worked. Personally, I think he did a good job.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","long-ford","5 February 2009","Mr Bean's Holiday is very different from the first film. Here Bean, played disarmingly by Rowan Atkinson, is more relaxed and the pace gentle. Only some parts work but those that do are hilarious (eg: Mr Bean singing for his supper). William Dafoe has a funny cameo as a narcissistic actor-directer. The hand-held camera occasionally got too much for me and was unnecessary. Scenes which didn't work for me include Mr Bean trying to eat seafood at a fancy restaurant. Still, I had a pleasant time and would recommend this film at least for home viewing.Overall 6/10","

Unfortunately, cute is rarely funny. As charming as individual spots are, there is an overall creative sluggishness to the script that cannot be ignored.

Sound scores were totally great and fit perfectly with tone and aesthetic of this movie and rowan atkinson's body gesture itself. Simple storyline that will definitely reminds you of the OG mr bean's tv series as well as the animated series. It could be a christmas movie or any family bonding day movie.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","sashank_kini-1","25 April 2007","This move was not so good as i expected. In the first scene,BEan goes to the lottery place. When the announcer announces the winning number as 919, Mr.Bean has that number but reads it in the opposite way, that is 616. Hethrows the ticket with starts roaming in the toy train. When he reaches the toy train, he finds a ticket( his own ticket) with the number 919 scrawled on it. When the announcer is about to pick another number, he shouts that he has the number. He is sent for a holiday to Cannes. I surely did not laugh on this stupid humor done in films many times. Then he takes a train and leaves for Cannes with his irritating camera which he carries all the way. He keeps looking through the camera, which is very irritating and keeps taking videos of useless things. We have seen him doing the same thing in an old episode of Mr.Bean series. We then see a director who too is ready to go to Cannes for the film festival. Mr.Bean leaves the train and leaves for the wrong place. From there, without looking where he is going, he walks straight to the station. There he misses the train due to his dumbness and decides to go to a restaurant. There the waiter advices to have sea food platter. The waiter brings the platter which, instead of having fish and crabs, has puking things like oysters and odd sea animals. Mr.Bean starts having the oyster unwillingly . He gathers the oysters in the hotel's napkin and throws it into a lady's purse. Haven't we seen this before in an episode of the series of Mr.Bean? These things looked more Gross than being fun and I couldn't laugh at this. Then the lady, whose purse is full of oysters, puts her hands in it to remove her ringing mobile. By this time, Bean runs away and the lady screams, and surprisingly, I didn't laugh at all. These stupid things do not make me laugh. Then he tells a man to take his video while he walks up to the train. The man is an actor who also is going to the Csnnes film festival and his son is in the train waiting for him. But because of some errors the man is left behind. He calls his son and tells him to wait for him in the next station while the son gets very sad. Mr.Bean tries to cheer him up in many ways ( all of them have already been seen ) but the boy punches him in the face. in the next station the boy gets down and Bean sees a drunkard trying to do something to the boy and so he too gets down from the train and the drunkard goes away. When Mr.Bean tries to get on the train, he sees that the boy has his camera. When he tries to take it, the train leaves away with Bean's suitcase. The boy tries to cheer him up by miming him which was slightly humorous. They then see the train but it doesn't stop. The father shows them a board and tells them to phone on a number scrawled on it. Mr.Bean shoots the number on the camera but the last two numbers are marred by his fingers. Then Mr.Bean makes a list of all numbers from 1 to 99 and then starts dialing from the number ending with 01. When on 03, the boy lifts the phone. It is the right number but as a maid picks it up, the boy thinks that it is wrong and he keeps the phone. They see a train stopping and they climb on it. But Bean finds that all the money and the train tickets are left outside and so he tells the boy to hide and he himself hides in a bathroom but finds a man already occupying it. When the ticket collector opens the door, she finds them together. This scene made me laugh somehow. She throws the boy and Bean from the train. Mr. Bean starts dancing to get money.When he plats a woman's role carrying the boy in her hands and singing th opera, it made me rock my seat at it was really funny. Then Mr.Bean loses his bus ticket and he runs to catch the flying ticket which gets attached to a hen's leg. He rides his cycle and follows the van with the hen in it and rides faster than a group of professional cyclists! This was really funny but then it gets boring when he finds himself in a shooting site for an ad. He by mistake blows up the same director who is mentioned in the starting. Then heroine of the ad takes him to Cannes but the boy rides off in another van with a group of singers, as Bean forgets to take the boy while trying to catch his ticket. He then meets the boy later and the three go to Cannes, but then the actress finds that the cops are searching for Mr.Bean. She tells them to dress up as women. Meanwhile. the same director who was blown up comes to the festival in good condition! How come? Bean and the actress find out that the director, who was that actor himself in the movie, had cut her role. He decides to change the tape and show the videos of hers which he had taped in his camera. At last, the actor gets his son and Bean gets to see the beach.The movie wasn't so good at all. Mr.Bean's facial expressions were same and unfunny.The actress was good. THe boy looked a bit too woody faced.This movie should be only seen by people who either haven't seen Bean at all or have tattooed their whole body with his face and not by others.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","LazySod","26 April 2007","What's there to tell about Mr. Bean that hasn't been told before? I think he's one of the world widest known characters and that's a good thing. This film comes 10 years after its first one and luckily it doesn't copy much of that one. With that it stands on its own but still doesn't compare well to the series. Anyway, the story is simple: Bean wins a trip to Cannes and goes there by train. Knowing him, disaster is lurking just around the corner in heavy dosages.And with that the film has had its description. That is what you get, no more, no less. A decent way to spend a bored evening, but nothing I'd advise anyone to visit a cinema for.6 out of 10 Beany bits of laughter","

His unique performance of Mr Bean throughout the series and the movies is unforgettable. This movie is just as great as the others. It's really a perfect fit for a family movie evening. The humor is so simple a baby could understand it and nevertheless adults laugh as much as their children. The character of Mr Bean is just phenomenal. Without Rowan Atkinson this would be someone else. He is just made for this role.I can highly recommend you this movie if you are looking for great homor and entertainment for the whole family.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","editor-299","18 August 2007","I suppose one has to have a taste for Rowan Atkinson's befuddled, almost retarded Bean character  like having a taste for Brussels sprouts or anything with okra in it.And if Monty Python ranks an 11 on the British comedy meter, then Bean would rate about a 3.5 at the most. Still, apart from being a colossal moron, Bean (an idiot savant  without the savant) is essentially harmless; and the sequel to his self-titled 1997 film, ""Mr. Bean's Holiday,"" is diverting, if not all that funny.Assuming we know all about this upper-class twit with a horrible, elastic face, the plot here quickly cuts through all the superfluous nonsense and cuts right to the chase; Bean enters a raffle where first prize is a week's vacation on the beach in Cannes, France.Of course, for the sake of the film, he holds the winning ticket (even though at first he does not realize it), and is soon off to Paris.Naturally, though, he becomes involved in a series of misadventures, some of which are funny, others falling flatter than pancakes. Most of these jokes involve the man-child Bean wrecking someone's personal effects or disrupting something of great importance.The two more hilarious segments include an attempt to devour a seafood platter at a Parisian restaurant; and the introduction of Willem Defoe as a pretentious movie director attending the Cannes International Film Festival.Those scenes which do not work include Bean destroying a guy's laptop, causing a father and son to be separated (he then travels with the kid), trying to steal a man's moped, dancing to Shaggy's 1993 hit, ""Boombastic,"" and attempting to chase down a chicken with a bus ticket attached to its foot.That last bit seems to go on forever, with little payoff. Plus, instead of just getting a new bus ticket, he leaves the boy and chases the bird for (what seems like) hundreds of miles with no payoff on the whole premise.Some of ""Holiday"" is like that, however, long expository setups for little or no bang for the punchlines. Another thing that bothered me was the irritating hand-held camera shots (simulating the camcorder Bean has with him at all times); most of these feature (far too) many extreme closeups of his rubbery-contorted face and barely intelligible mumblings.Atkinson, whom I liked much better in the TV series ""Blackadder,"" as well as his supporting work in films like ""Scooby-Doo"" and ""Rat Race,"" among others, nevertheless plays the cretin very well  in that many times during the picture one feels like slapping the crap out of him.Much of the movie's short 87-minute run, he plays like a poor man's Jerry Lewis, and his slapstick routines score below the Three Stooges.All in all, though, it's the last few minutes that really saves this production(in fact, it almost worth the price of admission to see a creepy Defoe singing ""Beyond The Sea"" in French) from going off the deep end.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","lescamer","26 May 2007","""Mr Bean's Holiday"" is a tribute to Jacques Tati's ""Les Vacances De Monsieur Hulot"". Like Tati's film, this one is pretty much silent, with dialog and sounds of course but they are not important at all. They are more a music than something that makes you follow the plot. Rowan Atkinon is superb in the film, much better than in the first film, as he does not have much dialog to say. Some of the scenes are hilarious. Examples: Going to the restaurant with Jean Rochefort, Bean's encounter with a Czechoslovakian filmmaker, and a scene with an American film director. Unfortunately, towards the end, everything is screwed. Dialogue becomes important for understanding what the hell is going on, corny clichés take place. For example, a French woman ends up loving Mr. Bean.","

The evening I saw it the kids in the cinema laughed throughout, so it definitely has appeal for all ages. Very good use of music, and Mr. Bean's musicality was well showcased. Like the television series, there was not a lot of dialog and almost none from Mr. Bean. A major flaw in the other films was that Bean spoke throughout. Good acting, especially from Willem DaFoe. Although there were some scenarios familiar to viewers of the television series, there were certainly enough fresh material to be enjoyed by seasoned Bean fans.****Possible spoiler***** Teddy was missed, though. Maybe he got left behind in the suitcase?","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","willcundallreview","10 July 2015","Rating-4/10Mr Bean's Holiday is a movie version(second of that) to the popular TV series of well, Bean. But of course as the title alludes to this is Mr Bean going on holiday and wins a prize to go to France, but when does anything go right for Mr Bean. Now this is surely a movie only some can enjoy and many not, it's the kind of plot that doesn't work but the film has it's moments of laughter and even slight heart so there is a lot to discuss.Now Mr Bean yet again gets into a little trouble, and his near stereotypical mental institution tendencies make him hard to see as a real person just walking about the street. Rowan Atkinson who is behind it all does play him well all in all though and he is one reason I give this rating a slight bit higher, the cast is full of names but it is Atkinson who out does them all, his brand of comedy really coming out for all to see.I wasn't so keen on the story of it all, I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it but it gets a little messy and the humour isn't exactly placed very well, the movie can have long droughts of no comedy and then many jokes all at once. I also wasn't over keen on the writing, Hamish McColl and Robin Driscoll don't bring much out, and with Bean hardly saying a word you could say I'm being unfair but some parts I just feel are not written well and seem too much like TV.I do however love the locations, this is one film that is absolutely beautiful to look at and really does make you want to go on that prize holiday too(just without the silly goings on). The film also boasts a particularly French and fine score, Howard Goodall makes this great to listen too as well, ascetically it is a fine piece of work, just maybe the plot needs a tune up. I felt this movie does need a touch from some of Atkinson's previous colleagues such as Richard Curtis maybe to come on, with Curtis creating Mr Bean and writing the previous movie, it would have given them a second chance to make Bean great again but on the big screen.I will add a more positive note though to all this rather negative wording I am using. I have great respect for Atkinson and Mr Bean, it is hard to go make a movie 10 years on from a mixed response movie and hope it be well reviewed(which this is not). I do think this is partly enjoyable though, let your inner child out and don't criticise too much and this can be absolutely hilarious, maybe not always for me but I expect some to fall in love with Mr Bean.Overall a comedy I wouldn't recommend but wouldn't completely shut down either, give it a go if this is your type of slapstick like humour and you may like it a lot. I think we have maybe seen the last of Bean on the cinema screen now forever, and unless they find a new person to be him, I don't see Rowan Atkinson coming in to do another one, would love to see one last go but I doubt it very much.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Christopher_Reid","18 April 2009","Another Memento-style viewing though it probably wasn't as significant this time. Comedies are more about funny scenes than building suspense (although this one does try).Mr. Bean's Holiday has heart. It's not great by a long shot but there is something beautiful about the story. Maybe it's this sort of naive commitment to a simple concept we can all relate to (Mr. Bean trying to find his way to the beach). Not very artistically interesting but like a child's innocent effort at making something good. That forgives the movie's flaws a bit I guess. Including some run-of-the-mill directing and just plain weaker segments. But Rowan Atkinson is still a comic genius.Mr. Bean is never unfunny or even boring but its disappointing that his potential isn't captured here. There are plenty of memorable situations and the gags don't exactly miss but they all could've become so much more. What I did like were all the little moments of hilarity which are utterly unique to Mr. Bean. Such as the expression on his face when he intentionally drops a knife in an early scene. Or what he cleverly decides to do with some oysters. Mr. Bean comes across as such an authentic character so that his numerous funny traits represent the best kind of timeless humour. He also doesn't realise he's funny which is incredibly important.Another lol aspect of the movie was Willem Dafoe's role as Carson Clay. The parts we see of his self-indulgent film were a ridiculously funny highlight. Again, Carson doesn't know this which is all for the better. It was spot-on satire. I especially loved Dafoe's reaction at the opening credits of his movie, sharing his excitement with a friend. Oddly familiar.The supporting cast are very likable but the story just doesn't have any gravity to it. But whatever, it's a cute tale. And very funny at times. But I was expecting mediocre film-making and for the most part it delivered. Oh, what a masterpiece this might have been!","

So I was glad to hear that there was going to be another Mr Bean movie.Unlike the last movie, there isn't much dialogue. They went back to basics and did what the TV show did. Which was actions instead of words.However, the story and jokes in this movie are poor.The joke where Mr Bean says ""Gracias"" about 30 times is not funny. Like the last movie, jokes from the TV are recycled in this one. It's nice to do a reference to a previous show you did, but you need new material or else you're repeating yourself.Also, when Mr Bean causes the father to get separated from his son, Mr Bean doesn't seem to care. You hate Mr Bean for doing that. This is when I decided that the movie wasn't great. I did get a chuckle from the little boy slapping Mr Bean in the face, though. There are a lot of pointless scenes in this movie. It's like they were trying to make the movie longer, because there isn't much of a story. Such as the scene where Bean is in the restaurant and what the hell was that scene where Mr Bean was in the shed all about? That scene went on forever and you just want the movie to end. If you thought those scenes were bad, check out the deleted scenes.There's even a deleted scene where Sabine tries to kill herself.I am not joking. Check the deleted scenes if you don't believe me. And to add insult to injury, the cast break the fourth wall at the end. Yep. Even for a Mr Bean movie, this is unnecessary. A very boring and unfunny movie. I'll just stick with the TV show.","

Bean even does pelvic thrusts and chases chickens like Borat, the brainchild of another British comic.The ""humor"" depends on Bean being brain-dead, yet he figures out how to operate a camcorder, get across Paris using a compass, raise money for food and bus tickets, rig the effects board so that the Ugly American Director blows his stack (literally), change seats with the girl without crashing the car, and run his video on a commercial projector!The father, a big-shot director, decides to take the train to Cannes alone with his boy? Yeah, right! And he is SO worried about Junior, he attends the premiere of the Ugly American Director's self-indulgent crap! Makes sense to me, too. Junior never thinks of going to the police, but instead tries repeatedly to call Pop even though he and Bean can't figure out the last two numbers. But then, Pop isn't exactly busting his hump to find Junior! Why didn't the girl or Bean let someone know they had the boy instead of trying to pass him off as her daughter?

I do have to say the film was not that bad and it did amuse me in some way. If they are to make another film about Mr.Bean they have a lot of things to work on to make my ratings higher than they are.

Of course it wasn't that good as TV Series and I wouldn't say that it was that good as a first part, but still it had it's moments and if you like Mr. Bean than you will not be disappointed. Not like a first part, this one was more like a silent comedy (just like the original TV series). Mr. Bean gets himself in to similar situations as he has already been in TV series, which bring back so many good memories, also the new type of humor was used which was not typical for Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean sometimes showed his evil side and that as always was funny. So if you liked previous Mr Bean films, than you'll probably like this one, it is a little different but not too much, you just have to watch it open-minded.","

Using the same concept as the television show, this film gives us helpings of pure slapstick comedy. Some like it, some not so much. But it serves its purpose. Rowan Atkinson once again gives us a sensational performance as an idiot (for use of better words) And Willem Defoe shows us that he does have a funny side to his acting! Fans of the first movie might be disappointed as evidently they took a different approach to this one.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","pgbender","10 September 2007","Prior to seeing this film, I was unfamiliar with Mr. Bean except for the movie trailer and some word-of-mouth--which, to my retrospective surprise, has been mostly positive. All the indications I had were that Bean was a sort of modern-day Charlie Chaplin; as I like Chaplin's humor, I figured I'd give Mr. Bean a go.While there are some good comic scenes that may have been able to work as a TV episode compressed to 30 minutes or so, there was not nearly enough material to sustain a 90 minute movie. I found that Bean was at his best when he was the bumbling fool--making stupid mistakes or unwittingly getting himself and others into trouble, and then making it worse as he tried, with equal ineptitude, to get back out of it. But there was precious little of that. In fact, most of what Bean does is motivated by conniving, selfish, and mean-spirited intentions rather than bumbling innocence. Here are a few examples:!!!SPOILERS FOLLOW!!! --Early in the film, Bean accidentally spills his coffee on a sleeping passenger's laptop as he makes his way down the shaky aisle of a train. It is a very funny bit of slapstick. But Bean feels no shame, no hint of apology or even misgiving, his biggest care (other than getting away undetected) is whether he can manage to pour off enough of the coffee from the keyboard to recover the better part of his cup. -- While trying to cover-up the fact that he doesn't want to eat the raw oysters served him in a chic French restaurant, Bean intentionally dumps his foul and slimy payload into the handbag of a woman seated at the table next to him. --While trying to get back to his bus, Bean starts hitchhiking. A guy riding a pitifully slow motorized bike is gracious enough to pick him up. But of course the bike is so anemic it can't carry them both. As the owner of the bike decides how he might tinker with it to improve the situation, Bean maliciously and inconsiderately decides to steal the bike right out from under the nose of his Good Samaritan. !!!END OF SPOILERS!!!So the comparison with Chaplin is not a good one. Chaplin may have found himself in situations similar to the ones described above, but he always had a childlike naiveté, and he was generally self-deprecating; while his ineptitude he may have sometimes caused others frustration, Chaplin would had have never had the deep-rooted nastiness to intentionally and maliciously take advantage of others' vulnerabilities while in pursuit of his goals.One of the things I generally appreciate in British comedy is the mastery of understatement and deadpan humor. Bean seems to try to do this, but his is such an in-your-face presentation that it becomes exactly the opposite: after what seems like several minutes of repeated extreme close-ups of Bean's disproportionate features, they gradually become far more grotesque than funny.I don't remember the name of the actress who played the French Actress in the film. She has a very captivating screen presence. Both she, and Wilem Dafoe (who plays an egotistical film director) give the best performances in this tedious film. Their work is much better, I thought, than anything in the rest of the film.","

The boysThis film was an absolute comedic masterpiece. I especially loved how the characters were filming thoughout the movie and then how it came together into a mini movie at the end. Mr. Bean is always a blast to watch because of the sheer silliness. William Dafoe's character in this movie was comedic gold. Overall this movie was a fun satire on film business. It's a phenomenal family movie and it's guaranteed to make you laugh. I feel like it accomplished everything it was trying to do plot wise. It is definitely worth a watch.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","jaxenross","25 May 2017","The movie was as much as necessary when I watched it back then on TV; the only fault I have for this movie? Losing personal belongings. To my way of thinking of this cliché, I don't like specific films on account of the protagonist losing his / her personal belongings, because you never know if he / she gets them back. I would have loved to see an additional post-credits scene where Mr Bean inexplicably gets all of his personal belongings back and returns to civilization, but that never happened. I would have given the movie a plus, if that were to happen. Overall, humdrum little movie.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","kurtCutajar_mlt","8 April 2007","It has been quite some time since the world last saw Bean, but was a return truly necessary? Unfortunately the answer is No! The film is highly appealing to a young audience and you may find yourself laughing your heart out, but in the long run, you shall leave the theater unchanged and possibly even forgetting the past hour and a half.Story and sense is rarely a comedy's forte, and Bean doesn't try to be one of those few comedies which attempt at doing so. Actually, in its attempts to try and create a story out of nothing, the film falls flat on its face. The main ""plot"" is Bean trying to get to Cannes after a tweaked lottery win. Obviously, extremely predictable delays and obstacles ensue, and it's these delays which make up most of the film. Along the road, Bean teams up with a boy who has lost his father and they both try to reach Cannes together.Rowan Atkinson may have gone down in cinema legend for his show stopping comedy performances, but in this film he seems lost and without a proper script and a dictionary consisting of approximately 6 words, I'm afraid to say that his charm is beginning to wear off. Nevertheless, credit is still due, because I doubt that there is any other actor capable of pulling off his antics with the same amount of innocence and credibility. The boy, whose name is Stepan, is played by Max Baldry and whilst he handles his role relatively well, I am beginning to get fed up with the endless amount of children in blockbuster movies. They are only included to try and look cute, and to try and squeeze out a tender father and son relationship. Willem Defoe may curse the day he committed himself to this film, but his inclusion is essential and he managed to have me roaring with laughter most of the time. It may be a bit of a career low, but I doubt his minimal role shall actually be remembered. The only female role in the film was that of Sabine, by Emma De Caunes, and I am in two minds about her. On one hand, she has charm and she silently steals the show. However, on the other hand, she is an extremely annoying and predictable French woman who happens to be an aspiring actress.In terms of sets and cinema magic, the film sinks rock bottom, and it constantly looks like a mediocre road movie. The fact that a video camera is commonly used may also bother the viewer. However, with all these shortcomings, the film still shines thanks to Bean and his crazy doings. They may seem ridiculous on paper, but in motion they are pure genius. In my opinion, most of them spread a grin on your face and about three have you howling with laughter.VerdictWhilst the film may not appeal to the more mature and drama-loving viewer, the film is an impressive watch for families and friends who are merely looking for some fun.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","manchester_england2004","28 July 2009","MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the second spin-off movie from the British sitcom, MR. BEAN. It comes 10 years after the first spin-off movie entitled BEAN. Rowan Atkinson reprises the title role.The plot of MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is merely a set-up exercise for a series of loosely connected vignettes. Mr. Bean wins a holiday to Cannes where he gets into a variety of mishaps but his only objective is to see the beach.The vignettes in question recycle many gags from the TV series just as the first movie did. Without giving away spoilers, I am able to say I could name no less than six episodes of the TV series where gags are lifted from. Further I can add that in the case of one episode, two gags are lifted, one of which was already repeated in the first movie. In all cases, the evidence demonstrates that the gags were done right the first time in their original context and that their reuse is merely to pad out the movie's running time.The movie does contain lots of padding. Most of this comes in the form of scenes that go on for too long. Many of these are in the middle of the movie.Another problem is the change of location. Mr. Bean is transposed from his normal surroundings in London to France. This is significant because it means that the characters in the movie, being from a different place and under different circumstances, react differently to their counterparts in the TV series. And the difference in reaction removes a significant part of the humour evident in the TV series. In short, it's nowhere near as funny.But this movie has a fourth problem - Mr. Bean himself. The portrayal is a long way departed from the TV series creation. In many scenes, his mannerisms are exaggerated to such a degree that the gags become too dumb to be funny. I found myself thinking that I was not watching the real Mr. Bean but instead a pale caricature. Rowan Atkinson's heart was clearly not in the movie. The meticulous planning he invested in every single scene in the TV series is absent. After the movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play Mr. Bean again.Finally, the ending scenes to this movie, whilst uplifting, represent an unsatisfying conclusion to the screen life of a comic creation loved in dozens of countries around the world. It's as though the producers ran out of ideas and just thrown in something random, hardly a swansong. Episodes of the TV series had better endings.Ironically, despite the movie's significant shortcomings, I must admit that I find it far better than the first movie. There are many things in the movie's favour.First, the producers proceed as though the first movie was never made, ensuring those who do not like that movie have confidence that something more appealing will transpire from this effort.Second, the type of humour returns to its British roots, as opposed to the Hollywood version we saw in the first movie.Third, some new gags are very funny, including one where Mr. Bean rides a bicycle.Fourth, some good music is contained within the movie even though it has very little context to the images on the screen. I find the music here far better than the seemingly random completely unrelated songs Hoolywood producers decide to tag on to their movies.I believe the producers should be commended for the good aspects at the same time as being criticised for its shortcomings, especially when these good aspects make the movie watchable enough for die-hard fans of the TV series. Yes I am a die-hard fan of the TV series and viewing this movie was a pleasant enough experience.I feel the need to defend the movie from its strongest criticisms on IMDb. Those who have given this movie a rating of ""1"" are mostly either American viewers accustomed to American humour or are die-hard fans of the TV series who feel very letdown after seeing what is likely to be the final outing of a character they very much love. Their ratings are exaggerated and unfair. The movie may very well disappoint such people but to claim that it somehow ranks next to the likes of DISASTER MOVIE is absurd to say the least.I often feel that the movie could have been done better and thus elevated to a higher level of quality quite easily. We should have had more scenes of Mr. Bean in London before he goes on holiday, maybe one or two new sketches to re-establish the character. The scenes in France should have been planned better so they more closely resemble the spontaneity of those in the TV series. Rowan Atkinson should have been given a greater say in the project so he would at least have some heart in it. And nothing from the TV series except running gags should have been reused even if this did result in a shorter running time.A user on this site began a thread on the message board explaining how this movie would have been better as a new slightly extended episode of the TV series. I agree with that analogy.In short, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY represents what is now expected to be the final episode of Mr. Bean - an extended sub-par episode. Die-hard fans will want to see the movie at least once but they should not expect to see the character as they once knew and loved him. Die-hard fans of British humour who have never seen the TV series may also want to take a look. But everyone outside of these two categories would do best to avoid it.","

Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius, no doubt.But, in comparison with the first movie, this successor is a huge disappointment. With the exception of a few scenes this movie is unfortunately a waste of time and money. The storyline is sometimes incomprehensible. The French girl with the never ending smile never fits in well as her relation to Mr Bean is strange and unnatural. There are so many forced scenes and bad timings in this movie that it becomes awkward watching through and only made me yawn. Sorry but Rowan Atkinson could have made something *much much* better than this.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","NestorNestor","11 January 2017","'Mr. Bean's Holiday' might not be as hilarious like the TV-series and it will never reach comedy classic status, but it's quite enjoyable lighthearted film. The gags (like in the first movie) are reused old ones from the series and their outcome is somewhat predictable, but compared to the first feature Bean film, in 'Holiday' they are much better integrated into a story and they actually movie the film along while the first film had some sort of story just for an excuse to show Mr. Beans eccentricities on big screen to American audiences. 'Holiday' had some unexplainable warmth that gives you the good feeling while watching this film even if the most Mr. Bean's shenanigans have been seen million times before. Hilarious addition was Willem Dafoe's in love with himself filmmaker. That gave the film nice satire element also showing higher than everybody else artist who is just another shallow materialist (while being artsy director, he still does commercials).Almost ten years have passed after it's release, but 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is easy to visit again after couple of years.","

Few can accomplish so much with so little and without using but the odd word here and there. Mr Bean goes to the dentist is a classic episode and Bean dresses him self in his Austin Mini before the dentist appointment also hilarious, Two many classics and i own this lot on DVD. Bean in USA was pretty funny and i liked that as well, Bean in France is a tired old dog with all the old tricks for show one last time before everyone gets tired of them, maybe there are young people how have never enjoyed Mr Bean like i have and will laugh them self senseless but for everyone else it's just not funny anymore.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","mikelancasterghs","3 August 2007","Painfully unfunny. The film has very little dialogue and no laughs. It's just Rowan Atkinson mugging endlessly for long stretches to the film camera, and when he's not doing that, he's making funny faces in his video camera.Even Mr. Bean's most ardent American fans will find the film tedious, and a tremendous letdown from the first film from 1997 which was quite amusing. Children, especially, will be bored silly and be begging to be taken out of the theater. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS (you've been warned): Plot: In London, Mr. Bean wins a raffle prize. It's a trip to France, and in particular, the Cannes Film Festival. But confusion ensues from the moment he sets out on the trip. Armed with his video camera, which gives us a weird Bean-point-of-view of his vacation antics, he boards a train and happens upon a young boy who is sitting alone. It seems that Bean has inadvertently prevented the lad's father from boarding the train and it has now left the station. Bean does everything he can to reunite the boy with his father, and eventually lands in Cannes, where the police think he has kidnapped the boy. There much more to the plot, I'm just giving you the basics. Don't even get me started on the love interest.It all ends at the Cannes Film Festival where a crazy director -- Willem Dafoe (the ONLY bright spot in the film) -- is set to premiere his latest 'artsy' film. Naturally, having Mr. Bean and his video camera anywhere near the cinema spells trouble for the director.The running time for 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is 90 minutes but it feels hours longer.I am quite surprised that Universal Pictures is wasting the money to release this in movie theaters in the United States when it should have gone direct to DVD. The film, such as it is, is simply not releasable to American audiences.The bottom line is this: There are no celebrity cameos, no laughs, little dialogue (at times it appears to be almost a 'silent movie'), and kids will hate it. There, I said it.Sorry the film is such a mess. I wanted to like it, and I enjoyed the first one. This one is horrible, sad to say.This will not do well at the U.S. box office... mark my words.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","andyhcg","4 April 2007","After reading review after review on IMDb, I was very excited to see the next Bean movie. The first Bean movie was fantastic, the film brought the audience to life. There was a laugh every ten seconds. Rowan Atkinson plays his role to perfection. Everyone knows who Mr. Bean is and the original movie just added to his comic genius . His facial expressions and his unforgettable voice make you leave the cinema with a constant grin.How could Mr. Beans holiday be so awful? Was Rowan drunk when he wrote the script for the movie? Could someone point me in the right direction and tell me where the laughs were? The only laughter I experienced was when a person besides me yawn. That sums up the film in my eyes. All I could do was yawn.I think that the major error throughout the film was that the jokes just weren't funny. I found myself constantly awaiting a climax in the film, like the painting being destroyed in the original movie. The ending (maybe the supposed climax) of the film was incredibly cringe worthy (for the wrong reasons). The ending was so cheesy and so abrupt that I left the cinema feeling as if the plot had gone absolutely nowhere.Overall Mr. Bean's holiday was a giant disappointment and I really feel that it could have been better. Hopefully if they decide to make another Bean movie, it will be as amazing as the original.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","thelandofoo","30 August 2022","Rowan Atkinson's most popular character wins a trip to France and as you'd expect, he is the catalyst of one disaster after another. After watching this film recently, I feel as if some critics may have been a bit too harsh on this one. The cinematography is admittedly pretty good as we are treated to the landscape of France and reflects an understanding of Bean's mission to reach Cannes Beach. I Remember laughing so hard that I got light headed as we are served with some pretty good gags. The supporting cast all around does a fairly good job, with some making multiple appearances. Willem Dafoe gives an enjoyable performance as a pretentious and egotistical director, acting as a perfect contrast for the story his character is a part of. Overall, the film gives this charming vibe where it is hard to hate it. Sure, it's nothing exceptional, but did it really have to be? Final verdict: 8/10.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","Marion88","30 May 2008","Monsieur Hulot is waving his hat throughout this modern day slapstick brilliant work of art and wit. Bean and Steve Bendelack's tasteful directing and sense of composition bring us to the verge of tears at moments as they manage to bridge the Franco British cultural bridge better than centuries of malicious so-called diplomacy. Before Bienvenue chez les Chtis the south of France / Channel shores clash is explored with an impressive display of indisputable talent. The French peasant on his solex bike embodies the genius of Mr Bean's Holiday. The ludicrous French bike solex which Bean thinks will come and rescue him in this deserted landscape of endless wheat fields moves so slowly it does barely grow in the horizon. The French take their time, they know how to enjoy life. They chose to work 35 hours weeks to enjoy life to the full, making a reality the US entertainment fantasy motto ""life is for living""; The contrary of the alienating work ethics fueled by guilt and greed imposed upon the people in the UK and the US. England chose to scrap the whole peasant class early in the XIXth century when the French kept their tariffs to protect their rural world. A French peasant on a slow moving solex comes to rescue Bean. Bean has time to take a nap before the solex reaches him. When it does Bean takes advantage of the French peasant's willing to help to try and steal his bike (the dark side of Bean) only to fail miserably and receive the punishment he deserves in the hilarious side of the road wood cabin prison trap. Bean is a very well written, very well acted and directed film, people behind it should be offered more films to make!","

The first part of the movie is too melancholic for a comedy and the jokes don't seems to have the excepted effect as it used to have.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","alan_v35","12 September 2007","Mr. Bean is back to give us ninety minutes of nonsense that is mainly dependent upon physical comedy. This, the second Bean movie, is more European than the first. The movie starts out weak, but does get better as it goes on, though the humor is more likely to elicit a chuckle than a laugh, even among Bean fans, which I admit I am not.The man with a thousand faces starts out here by winning a trip to Cannes in a church raffle. On his way to the legendary beaches of the Riviera, he ruins the day of a few people before accidentally separating a father and son on their way to Cannes. The hero then tries to help the poor boy, Stepan (Baldry) re-unite with his father and soon has plenty of problems of his own, before he meets an aspiring actress named Sabine (de Caunes) after disrupting American film director, Carson Clay's (played by Dafoe) film efforts. There is a chicken chase, an opera performance, and a film festival premiere, but most of all, there is constant Bean idiocy and camera mugging that has gained Atkinson millions of fans all over the world.This film was not to my taste, but my companion, who was a Bean fan, suggested that four stars would be a fair rating. Her assessment, notwithstanding, I went lower than that. Not only because I didn't get too many laughs out of this one, but also because I didn't see any uproarious response from the crowd, which I would expect included a good number of Bean fans. So, there it is. Bean fans will probably enjoy it, while their companions will probably feel like they are proving their loyalty/love/friendship, etc. by going along.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com","

British comedy at it's finest. But, this film basically just left me bored; the jokes seemed overly repetitive (for those who saw it - did you not once get tired of Mr. Bean forgetting things?), the story-line was weak with unfamiliar characters playing a major role (who actually was that women who drove Bean?) and a bad attempt at trying to be sentimental (this type of stuff does not belong in a movie like this!).I hate reading overly negative reviews as much as you do so I won't bore you with how bad this is and how good it could be. But, really, it is definitely not an improvement on the debut film (which I enjoyed). Too be honest there is not much of a story-line to comment on so i'll leave you with a few words; this movie is ideal for kids! but for you older people see something else, please.","

It's something that would have fit in well with the silent film era since he rarely speaks, depending more on facial expression. But the silliness of his character getting into jams can be enjoyed in our modern times if one has the patience to watch. The Brits have a degree of comedy that the rest of us do not, and it's a big step up, without having to resort to jokes about sexual performance for instance. Look up his Christmas episode from about 30 years ago when he's shopping at Harrods or accidentally conducting Christmas musicians. I think I will, just for a refresher.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","epakorrekti-925-19171","20 December 2010","I really like the series and the first Mr.Bean movie in my opinion was good. Having Mr.Bean goofing around on a holiday in France sounds like a great idea, but this movie is far from it's premise. In the beginning, they build up a mood that soon something funny is going to happen, but no. Nothing happens. And that is pretty much the whole thing with this movie.There are potential scenes, but they just aren't funny. The kid isn't funny at all, but he has a lot of screen time. Most of the funny parts are not well introduced, and they are stretched to boredom. There are funny moments, but only few. For a 90 min comedy, less than ten funny moments are not enough. Most memorable funny moments are related to Mr.Bean's comments, and having almost a mute character, it is unbelievable.In the series, the whole idea is based on this weird character doing rather regular stuff, but in odd and funny way. In the first movie, the other characters were talking a lot and there was a plot, which make it feel bit weird, but in the end, the Bean character was in the centre and he was pretty much the same as in the series. In this movie however, he just looks like Bean, but doesn't feel like him. Most of the time, he is not on the screen, and when on it, he is not doing anything worth of even for a smile.Biggest problems with this movie are the chaotic story telling and lack of jokes. This movie is just a botch!","

Did the creators create the story after they had figured out what funny scenes and situations they wanted to put Mr Bean in? However, since a couple of scenes in the movie made me laugh loud, it saves the movie. It's a comedy and it made me laugh and smile a couple of times, what more can you expect? It's doesn't get it to objectively be a solid movie though, that's for sure.To summarize, it's a pretty bad movie, but it still made me happy watching it. It's also better than the first movie where Mr Bean was in Hollywood, they kept him more to his quiet mentality in this one, which suits him much better.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","singwaileung-1","26 April 2007","A lot of the people who say this is a great and amazing movie, are, like myself, most likely those who are very loyal to the greatness of the Mr Bean TV episodes and the work of the genius that is Rowan Atkinson. And those who canned this movie are probably big-wits who are just looking for pieces of art (or people who voted for the Departed as best film) - maybe they will give props to the ""nothing nothing"" film within the movie. I think its alright. Nothing to rave about, and nothing to hate on.But, to be honest, there are some recycled gags. There's scene where he eats raw food and chucks it in a lady's bag to hide the evidence. This is used in one of his episodes, as is the scene where he gets stuck in the hut, is a recycled part of an episode when he gets stuck in a post box. The camera: He gets someone to take photos for him with his camera, and it in some ways teases at it getting stolen before his eyes just as in the episode when someone runs off with his camera and the park and Mr Bean traps the thief in a waste bin and pokes him with a pen. And in some episodes, he has run ins with kids and he tries to please them - such as the baby in the fun fair, or the kid who gets travel sick on the plane. And does anyone have the feeling that this film is also a little like the the Brazilian film Central Station? But it doesn't matter about the recycled stuff. They bring back memories of those classic episodes that, those who have watched them over many times during the re runs every Christmas, have never forgotten. It's almost like Mr Bean's holiday is playing homage to the old Mr Bean, which is a compliment to itself in both respects. There really is no reason to hate it, so watching with an open mind and not expecting American Pie style Hollywood toilet humour, then you would no doubt feel fine about it.","

And you're faced with two choices: one being, you go watch paint dry and two being watching Mr. Bean's Holiday I say choose the first one.This movie is really for kids under 12 years! Frankly, I expected a fun stupid film, like dunno - Scary Movie 4 or something like that but all I got is retardation. I don not understand what is Rowan Atkinson who is now over 50 years old doing playing in this stupid film. And Willem Dafoe, what the hell is he doing here?! He was in Spiderman! The movie has NO JOKES! Also, most of the people in the theater came with kids. And by the way, I'm not an adult, I'm 15 years old. And I even liked American Pie, Scary Movie...etc...All in all I give this movie 1 out of 10, and advise you not to see it. Remember WATCHING PAINT DRY IS FUNNIER and you'll sleep better!","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","tnarulzimpactzone","10 May 2007","Although this film can be very funny in parts some of the film just isn't. A very funny part of the film happens near the beginning of the film in a restaurant, as funny as this was, the concept was clearly taken from an original TV episode of Mr Bean. A lot of the audiences attention was focus on the facial expressions he pulls at the video camera that he takes with him. While this was funny at first it became rather interminable the more the film went on. The part of the film that takes place and the Cannes film festival is rather boring and lacks entertainment. The funnies part of the film was at the end where all the cars stopped in unison to provide a pathway to the beach.In conclusion, for plot and story development the first film was far superior.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","szhsub","12 September 2007","Mr. Bean is British; therefore, he's ought to be funny. British physical comedies are actually funny in contrast with American comedies. I have seen almost all of Mr. Atkinson's television work featuring the character of Mr. Bean. In every episode, he successfully impresses you in a surprising manner. Every episode seems to be funnier than the previous one. When we see a movie featuring our favourite British character, we expect the same kind of surprises. In this movie, there were none. Some jokes were borrowed from Mr. Bean's television series. If you have seen enough physical comedies, you seem to predict the character's next move beforehand as you watch the show. Good shows/movies surprise you with what you are not expecting or predicting. If you have already seen enough Mr. Bean shows, you can predict many of his moves and comic tricks as you watch the movie.In my opinion, the character of Mr. Bean simply doesn't fit into the genre of movie as many popular British flicks seem to follow the American way of film-making. Although, unlike Bean: The Movie (1997), this movie was set in Europe (in France to be exact), it had almost the same shortcomings; however, Bean: The Movie (1997) was a lot funnier.I think Mr. Bean's Holiday can reach out to those people who do not have enough exposure to Mr. Bean's TV hijinks and could use 90 minutes of hearty laugh.","

We didn't stop laughing once and we were still giggling on the way home as we repeated lines and scenes in the car. Rowan Atkinson was not a disappointment at all, in fact we were happily surprised to see that is was really pure ""Bean"", and nothing bogged down the movie once! It was also a treat indeed to see ""Spiderman's"" nemesis, Willem Dafoe's, appearance. Mr. Dafoe has great comic timing. We have been ""Beaners"" since first watching the TV comedy a decade ago and have never been disappointed in a Rowan role....well, okay maybe once....""Rat Race"", but he was more or less a cameo in that. I would love to go on, but I would have to put up some ""spoilers"", and it would be better for you to see it as we did..without too much information.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","terence_303","4 April 2007","The first Mr. Bean movie I found was funny great plot and Mr. Bean being brilliantly funny, and the brilliant and great sketch with the priceless painting literally as Mr. Bean sketches a face on it after burning the real face off with paint stripper, great characters a family that bean stays with in America brilliant and hilarious misshapes going on non stop.But Mr. Beans Holiday is another matter ignoring the 1997 movie I think it was a mistake to come up with Mr. Bean winning a raffle flying to France and stopping a father getting his son to the Cannes film festival by accident then having to help the boy find his father. The first time you see Mr. Bean's interaction with the kid you hope to dear god that it is a short term sketch because the boy is both annoying and boring, the boy at one point copy's Mr. bean actions that part oh I hated it, why the Mr. bean we know and love wouldn't go out his way to help a kid all the way though a movie the funny thing about Mr. Bean was his child like selfishness.Some how the French boy and bean don't seem to work together apart from one or two scenes most of the time he seems to stop bean being what he is best at being bean, there are a number of good scenes I say five or six one were bean stumbles on a movie set with people dressed as extras in ww2 advert some how advertising yogurt or moose, but the best scenes the previous scene included are the scenes were bean is on his own doing what he dose best invading people space and causing havoc unknowingly.There one simple way to make this movie a sure fire hit get rid of the stupid annoying child because bean is the child we love and he doesn't share the screen for no one, so for our lovable man child that bean is, this isn't your best but its worth a look if you're a fan you will be disappointed, just do what I did try to ignore the French kid and enjoy bean.","

This movie is suited for incredibly immature people under 12. The starting started off weak and just went downhill from there. The music was great though.","

The first movie was so unfunny that i forgot what it was even about from excruciating boredom. I remember something about Whistler's mother? Whatever, anywho, this movie is equally terrible. Boring to the point of no return. A giant explosion killing all of the characters couldn't have saved this movie. It just keeps on with my theory that British people are not funny. Flat out terrible. Remember Hot Shots part Deux, when Atkinson gets thrown off the cliff, I was praying for that to happen in this film. The only thing that made me happy was knowing that i didn't pay to get in.

If you are a fan of the TV show or the original movie then this is defiantly one to watch as you will be delighted all the way through it. The movie is basically about Mr Bean winning a holiday to France along with a camera, until he meats up with a boy who is left on a train and his father has gone without him all because of Mr Bean. The boy and Mr Bean try doing several things to get the boy and his father back together but they also must go on a stupid adventure. The story was okay for me but even all the bad parts get made up for the hilarious scenes in the movie. I don't want to spoil them so I won't, but I can say that this is better than Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie by far, and I would check it out if I were you.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","fonghowang","24 January 2008","Mr. Bean's Holidayis not very well done. It is not funny enough, which everyone expects it should give us a good laugh. Also, it lacks creativity, comparing to Johnny English, the former film performed by Rowan Atkinson. The reason for not funny enough is closely related to the lack of creativity. As the same as the Mr. Bean TV series, it uses the same jokes and plots for laughters. For examples, it still uses the stupidness and carelessness to construct the plot of the film. It has no new plots and ideas, which is too boring for a Mr. Bean fan. All of the fans who had watched the TV series would know my feelings and opinions well. However, for those new to Mr Bean, whether films or TV programs, they can still enjoy very good and hearty laughters. Last but not the least, I am hoping and expecting there will be a new Mr. Bean film very soon which we can experience whole new ideas of jokes, instead of just like repeating and repeating the same story line.","

If you're hear for humour, this movie's perfect.However, there are two critical junctions where the plot fails to carry through. Mr Bean and the Russian boy were seperated. The way they were reunited was contrived by the movie's standards. The misunderstanding between the boy's father and director, and Mr Bean was abrupty resolved. The payoff between the conflict and resolution was meh.","

If you're looking for a late-night, deep, meaningful movie, select something else, but definitely save this to watch at a time when you want a feel-good movie.Don't take the negative reviews too seriously; Those reviewers probably preferred Dumb and Dumber. Bean's Holiday is a fun movie, and I'm glad I caught part of it while watching a movie channel because I set my DVR and caught the whole movie another time, and it was well worth it!

But it is nether for those or others. It is for little children. It shouldn't be rated PG. All jokes in this movie are 'stolen' from the TV series with a new twist at the end of the sketch. American Bean at least tried to invent something new and regardless the sugary note it was viewable. European Bean is a disaster from all angles. It's tormented. The new jokes are stupid and represents Bean in new retarded way. Where is all ingenuous geniality gone??? One Slovenian journalist asked Rowan what chances are for the Black Adder to be awaken from the dead. He answered: very little, almost none. My commentary is: thank god.

In fact, I usually find the character to be more annoying than funny. I took my three kids (13, 7, and 6) to see it and I hate to admit I really liked this film. It was very good natured and wasn't filled with gross out humor that seems to be a substitute for genuine laughs in kid movies these days. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good fart joke as much as the next guy, but let's face it, anyone can fart). I knew from the beginning where the film was going, but the trip there was a lot of fun.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","wusabizbroker","17 September 2007","Is this age of adult comedies such as Superbad, Old School, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc., it is surprising to see a G-rated comedy make you laugh. Which is exactly what ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" sets out to do and does well.""Holiday"" is what would have happened if Disney had made National Lampoons ""Vacation"". It is not a laugh riot as the aforementioned adult comedies, but a buddy movie that never has a dirty word or a bad thing to say about anybody.What Rowan Atkinson is good at is telling Mr. Bean's simple story, with complex situations. Case in point: after finally getting a bus ticket, it blows out the bus door, attaching itself to a chicken's foot and everything goes wrong with getting it back. But, as in usual Mr. Bean style, he manages to pull through.Only Rowan Atkinson can make it to his destination, a day at the beach, without saying so much as a paragraph throughout the entire film and with two main characters, one of which speaks only Russian. He is terrific at physical comedy and lip-synching; one of the funniest moments in the film.Take your family to see this, it is HEARTWARMING.","

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","nyx90","27 April 2007","Has Mr Atkinson run out of millions already? Why make another Mr Bean full lenght movie when the last one proved that this weir character obviously is so much better in a shorter TV-format. The questions this film bring are many. How thin can a script become before it is nothing at all? Is being ugly enough when the slapstick is almost gone? This movie has, as it's prequel, some really funny moments. Most of them are repeated over and over and for those who has seen the TV-show and the other movie, it's all in all the same little gags all over again. I think Mr Atkinson is brilliant when he is at his best, but this movie has the same problem as the first. Time. It is hard to fill an hour and a half with this kind of humor. The script is another problem. The story seemed to be written during a lunch, most of the funny scenes seems to be improvised without any goals except the thin script. The camera work are exactly the same as in the last movie with the exception that half of it seem to be through Mr Beans hand-held one. Sequels usually sucks, but this movie makes me squirm ragtime. Is Rowan Atkinson really that poor that he must squeeze the last dollars from this dying character.","

Many people say it is too stupid or basic, but those people clearly do not understand what Mr Bean is about. Mr Bean is meant to be a fun character who lacks intelligence, and this movie blatantly presents this. From start to finish, you get the pure Mr Bean. The story is also a dynamic I personally think fits perfectly. And though it is mostly comedic, it definitely contains some content that could be classified as emotional. The end is perfect; it's a summary of the movie from Mr Bean's perspective on a cinema screen. This movie is a must watch if you enjoy simple, basic comedy.","

From lost boys to self-absorbed filmmakers let's just say the language barrier is a minor setback.

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","orders-111","29 May 2008","This is something of a break in the Bean tradition in that it's a genuine feel-good film which doesn't have you reaching for the movie-sickness bag. You need know nothing about Mr Bean to understand and enjoy this film, as it makes no references to the earlier film or any of the TV shows. Bean, as usual, says very little during the film and relies on visual gags and facial expressions to convey the story and the humour.Although Rowan Atkinson is at his usual brilliant best, I can't help thinking that 11 year old Max Baldry, who plays the son of one of the Cannes Film Festival judges that gets separated from his father at a train station due to Bean's antics, stole the show. His mimicking of Atkinson on the bench in the train station is a classic worthy of a Marx Brothers film.Although Mr Bean has had a long run on TV and with his earlier, and I feel, weaker, film, the ideas in Mr Bean's Holiday are fresh, funny and highly enjoyable. An excellent bit of light entertainment for all ages. Hopefully the rumours that this is the last appearance of Mr Bean are not true.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","kulitkulitmo","2 September 2007","A decade ago, I watched the first Mr. Bean movie and it was a joy to watch, and I recently went to the cinema to watch the even funnier sequel! Mr. Bean (played by the laughable Rowan Atkinson) is at it again -- this time on a trip to Cannes, France, after winning a drawing as ""919"" in a church raffle. As he heads to a train to Cannes in Paris, he met a man, who offered to film him getting on board. As he gets on board, the train doors close, and that man (who turned out to be Emil Dachevsky) rushes to catch the train -- with his son, Stepan, on-board! Mr. Bean never failed to make me crack up. My favorite part has to be the scene when Bean samples the oysters (which ended up in the lady's purse, barely concealing her cell phone) and the langostines (in which Bean eats one of them, shell and all). I also like his lip-sync of a Puccini aria, his skill of making faces, and his lip-synching of ""La Mer"" with all the cast of the film in the traveler's favorite spot in Cannes -- THE BEACH!!! This deserves a perfect 10 because, in my humble opinion, it's the perfect summertime flick of the year!!!",NA

I went to an art school and was nodding my head in shame and acknowledgment during the scene where his character previews his film at Cannes. He is freaking hilarious.

Once Rovan Atkinson was a great man that made all things in to gold, but now he seems to have gone back. its longer and longer between the laughs, and as i wrote above: Most of the gags are stolen or re-used. The original TV-Bean is better, cause the movie-format is to long. I am a great fan of Rovan Atkinson, and especially Atkinson as Mr. Bean. But this film drove me to stop looking before the ending. So it is useless to use this film for any purpose, but you can use the DVD-disc as a mirror when you shave your face!",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","yamone-02288","30 August 2023","This is one of the best comedy movies that I have ever seen. It was released on March 24th, 2007 and directed by Steve Bendelack. In this movie, Mr. Bean wins a trip to France and accidentally separates a young boy from his father. So, he decided to reunite them. On the way, he made a humorous and unwitting mistake and it's utterly believable movie. And the main characters include Mr. Bean, the young boy Max, and a French actress played by Sabine. The movie ends with Mr. Bean successfully reuniting the young boy with his father. The acting in this movie is well-acted and there are no special effects. I particularly enjoy the soundtrack as it makes me feel relaxed and happy. This movie is grabbing from the beginning to the end. I love this movie because it is a hilarious and lighthearted comedy. This movie set in beautiful locations, making it an enjoyable watch.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","minkhantthufb","27 February 2024","Mr. Bean's Holiday is one of my favorite comedy movies. It is really awesome, hilarious, and the ending is heartwarming. Just seeing Rowan Atkinson on the screen makes me laugh and I appreciate his outstanding acting. The story starts when Mr. Bean won the trip to Cannes. In the movie, we can see the comedies and misunderstandings, like taking the wrong taxi and missing the train, that Mr. Bean faces on his trip. I watch this movie over and over and everytime I watch it, it never makes me bored. I think everyone who's watched it feels the same way. The movie is gripping from the beginning to the end. It is definitely perfect with beautiful scenes and music. It has a lot of summer vibe and is for any age, for the whole family to enjoy. So I highly recommend watching this movie with your family and friends during the summer holidays.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","eris-02876","28 February 2024","Mr. Bean's Holiday is a really funny movie! One of the best things I like about this film is that Mr. Bean doesn't talk much, but he is still very funny. He makes funny faces and dances. Even though he doesn't talk, I could understand what he was feeling because his face showed his emotions. It's amazing how much laughter and fun Mr. Bean can bring without saying many words. My favorite part was when he went to a fancy restaurant and tried to eat oysters. It was hilarious. This movie made me laugh a lot. It was really worth watching. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh and smile, Mr. Bean's Holiday might be a great choice.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","myominhtut-87725","4 March 2024","It is very interesting and very funny . If you watch from the beginning to the end, it make be happy because Mr. Bean can act with his funny face and action. The main character is the one who is Mr. Bean. He won the ticket it number is 919. At the station he buy to something and he pick up the money from his pocket and add the money the machine also his necktie was pick it up. I remember the action of actor is he ride a bicycle and he pull up his hand to the car. Although the car turn on the way, he go the straight and his bicycle was faster than the group of bicyclist. He can well-acted so I love the film rather than the funny movies.",NA

"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","lostchord-1","24 February 2008","I found this film very annoying. There were some funny Chaplin-esquire gags that I enjoyed, but overall I found the Bean character to be annoying. The odd vocalizations and silly walks would have been more appropriate for a 9 year old. This was my first introduction to Mr. Bean and I found myself wondering whether he ever converses in his other films or is his verbal communication always limited to strange grunts? I guess I'm the wrong audience, but I would not recommend Mr. Bean's Holiday.One thing I have to say though is Emma De Caune is delicious in this film.",NA
"Mr. Bean's Holidayatar","dariusmystery","29 April 2007","When I got out of the cinema hall a couple of days back after watching this, I was struck with a conflict in my mind that I wasn't too comfortable with. Had Rowan Atkinson finally stopped being funny as Mr. Bean, or had I lost the interest and humor in the character and grown up? I didn't want to know the answer either way because it was clearly a lose-lose situation.In this, the second film about Mr. Bean, our favorite protagonist is the lucky winner (or so it seems) of a local church contest, and is awarded an all expense paid trip across the English Channel, to France. Needless to say, all does not go as planned, and the rest of the film follows in his horrendous mistakes throughout his journey there. He's joined this time around by young Stephan, played by Max Baldry, a little known child star from the TV show Rome, and Emma De Caunnes who plays Sabine an extra actress, which ironically sums up her involvement in the film's proceedings. For the nostalgic ones of you, Teddy unfortunately was not a part of this movie.In a moronic attempt at videotaping himself in front of the TGV train, Bean is responsible for separating Stephan from his father, who just happens to be a famous film director, who just happens to be part of the Cannes Film Festival that just happens to go on at the same time as the movie. But that's OK really. You don't really need a fantastic plot for a Mr. Bean movie, and God knows the show didn't have it. But that's not the only problem in this movie. That being said, considering that Atkinson returned to this role after so long, he plays Bean perfectly. It's a pity the script didn't give him much to work with.I think why this movie failed for me, was because it lacked major in the kind of gags that we've grown accustomed to watching Mr. Bean perform.. In the show, and in Bean the Movie, there was never a dull moment at any point, because slapstick humor just kept hitting you in the face time and again, as frequently as those stupid plastic birds that you saw 'drinking' water in your schools' chemistry labs. With this movie, the pleasure was comparable to the act of just watching one of them fake birds, and expecting it to do something more productive like fly. Because by the end, or dare I say by the half way mark, you're wondering what exactly is funny, and you're wishing something happened. But nothing does.If there was a saving grace to this movie, its name was Willem Dafoe. He is the MAN! He plays a cameo role as a pretentious film director, at the Cannes Festival, that made the mistake of hiring Bean as a Nazi guard extra, an accident which resulted in a broken arm. The funniest point in this film was in the end when his character seems to take center stage, as the creator of ""Playback"" a Cannes nominated piece of crap, which reminded me very distinctly of various other pretentious t*rd-like excuses of movies that are churned out by self-obsessed no talent directors trying to sound 'deep' Some of the future directors of such drivel can be found in my own class. And I'm sure the rest of you know the kind of people I'm talking about. Dafoe would really be the only reason I'd go back to watch it again, if I was searching for a reason. Which is saying something considering this is a Mr. Bean movie, isn't it? Give me something more, Rowan. Give me something long the lines of drunkenly singing Yesterday with Peter MacNichol at 3 am on a Beverly Hills night. Give me Burt Reynolds as an army general, or destroying a million dollar painting by drawing a smiley face on it. That's the kind of stuff that was missing from this movie. Critics might say that the first movie was disastrous because it was set in America where Rednecks had to be explained who Bean was first.But Bean explains himself in his actions! Bean was funny because of the kind of stuff that happened to him whether he was on TV in the UK or in Beverly Hills in the movie. At the end of the day, this film turned into a human story about a kid that got lost away from his father. And a touristy ride through fruity Frenchy farmlands to get him back. What's so funny about that? I'm not sure I would recommend this movie to anyone who might be a fan of the show, the consequences might be a little bit violent, but I think everyone can watch it at least once, for the brilliance that is ""Playback"" Now that is a funny movie.",NA
