"1","Deployment and Analysis of Instance Segmentation Algorithm for In-field Grade Estimation of Sweetpotatoes","Hoang M. Nguyen, Sydney Gyurek, Russell Mierop, Kenneth V. Pecota, Kylie LaGamba, Michael Boyette, G. Craig Yencho, Cranos M. Williams, Michael W. Kudenov","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Shape estimation of sweetpotato (SP) storage roots is inherently challenging due to their varied size and shape characteristics. Even measuring ""simple"" metrics, such as length and width, requires significant time investments either directly in-field or afterward using automated graders. In this paper, we present the results of a model that can perform grading and provide yield estimates directly in the field quicker than manual measurements. Detectron2, a library consisting of deep-learning object detection algorithms, was used to implement Mask R-CNN, an instance segmentation model. This model was deployed for in-field grade estimation of SPs and evaluated against an optical sorter. Storage roots from various clones imaged with a cellphone during trials between 2019 and 2020, were used in the model's training and validation to fine-tune a model to detect SPs. Our results showed that the model could distinguish individual SPs in various environmental conditions including variations in lighting and soil characteristics. RMSE for length, width, and weight, from the model compared to a commercial optical sorter, were 0.66 cm, 1.22 cm, and 74.73 g, respectively, while the RMSE of root counts per plot was 5.27 roots, with r^2 = 0.8. This phenotyping strategy has the potential enable rapid yield estimates in the field without the need for sophisticated and costly optical sorters and may be more readily deployed in environments with limited access to these kinds of resources or facilities.","Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:47:05 UTC (34,324 KB)"
"2","Metasurface-based Spectral Convolutional Neural Network for Matter Meta-imaging","Kaiyu Cui, Shijie Rao, Sheng Xu, Yidong Huang, Jiawei Yang, Jian Xiong, Chenxuan Wang, Xue Feng, Fang Liu, Wei Zhang, Yali Li, Shengjin Wang","Optics (physics.optics)","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are representative models of artificial neural networks (ANNs), that form the backbone of modern computer vision. However, the considerable power consumption and limited computing speed of electrical computing platforms restrict further development of CNNs. Optical neural networks are considered the next-generation physical implementations of ANNs to break the bottleneck. This study proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (SCNN) with the function of matter meta-imaging, namely identifying the composition of matter and mapping its distribution in space. This SCNN includes an optical convolutional layer (OCL) and a reconfigurable electrical backend. The OCL is implemented by integrating very large-scale, pixel-aligned metasurfaces on a CMOS image sensor, which accepts 3D raw datacubes of natural images, containing two-spatial and one-spectral dimensions, at megapixels directly as input to realize the matter meta-imaging. This unique optoelectronic framework empowers in-sensor optical analog computing at extremely high energy efficiency eliminating the need for coherent light sources and greatly reducing the computing load of the electrical backend. We employed the SCNN framework on several real-world complex tasks. It achieved accuracies of 96.4% and 100% for pathological diagnosis and real-time face anti-spoofing at video rate, respectively. The SCNN framework, with an unprecedented new function of substance identification, provides a feasible optoelectronic and integrated optical CNN implementation for edge devices or cellphones with limited computing capabilities, facilitating diverse applications, such as intelligent robotics, industrial automation, medical diagnosis, and astronomy.","Mon, 19 Jun 2023 05:01:07 UTC (2,003 KB)[v2] Tue, 27 Jun 2023 12:16:44 UTC (2,006 KB)"
"3","Machine Vision Using Cellphone Camera: A Comparison of deep networks for classifying three challenging denominations of Indian Coins","Keyur D. Joshi, Dhruv Shah, Varshil Shah, Nilay Gandhi, Sanket J. Shah, Sanket B. Shah","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Indian currency coins come in a variety of denominations. Off all the varieties Rs.1, RS.2, and Rs.5 have similar diameters. Majority of the coin styles in market circulation for denominations of Rs.1 and Rs.2 coins are nearly the same except for numerals on its reverse side. If a coin is resting on its obverse side, the correct denomination is not distinguishable by humans. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a digital image of a coin resting on its either size could be classified into its correct denomination by training a deep neural network model. The digital images were generated by using cheap cell phone cameras. To find the most suitable deep neural network architecture, four were selected based on the preliminary analysis carried out for comparison. The results confirm that two of the four deep neural network models can classify the correct denomination from either side of a coin with an accuracy of 97%.","Fri, 12 May 2023 04:43:51 UTC (1,241 KB)"

A strong optical nonlinear response that can work under weak broadband incoherent light is essential for this purpose. Here we introduce an optoelectronic nonlinear filter array that can address this emerging need. By merging 2D transparent phototransistors (TPTs) with liquid crystal (LC) modulators, we create an optoelectronic neuron array that allows self-amplitude modulation of spatially incoherent light, achieving a large nonlinear contrast over a broad spectrum at orders-of-magnitude lower intensity than what is achievable in most optical nonlinear materials. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, we fabricated a 10,000-pixel array of optoelectronic neurons, each serving as a nonlinear filter, and experimentally demonstrated an intelligent imaging system that uses the nonlinear response to instantly reduce input glares while retaining the weaker-intensity objects within the field of view of a cellphone camera. This intelligent glare-reduction capability is important for various imaging applications, including autonomous driving, machine vision, and security cameras. Beyond imaging and sensing, this optoelectronic neuron array, with its rapid nonlinear modulation for processing incoherent broadband light, might also find applications in optical computing, where nonlinear activation functions that can work under ambient light conditions are highly sought.","Wed, 26 Apr 2023 05:46:12 UTC (1,692 KB)"

"6","City path tomography: reconstructing square road network from artificial users mobile phone data","Andy Rodriguez Lorenzo, Alejandro Lage-Castellanos","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Population mobility can be studied readily and cheaply using cellphone data, since people's mobility can be approximately mapped into tower-mobile registries. We model people moving in a grid-like city, where edges of the grid are weighted and paths are chosen according to overall weights between origin and destination. Cellphone users leave sparse signals in random nodes of the grid as they move by, mimicking the type of data collected from the tower-cellphone interactions. From this noisy data we seek to build a model of the city, {\it i.e.} to predict probabilities of paths from origin to destination. We focus on the simplest case where users move along shortest paths (no loops, no going backwards). In this simplified setting, we are able to infer the underlying weights of the edges (akin to road transitability) with an inverse statistical mechanic model.","Wed, 1 Mar 2023 22:09:06 UTC (191 KB)"
"7","Curriculum Learning for ab initio Deep Learned Refractive Optics","Xinge Yang, Qiang Fu, Wolfgang Heidrich","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Deep lens optimization has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing computational imaging systems, however it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single DOE or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a deep lens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate this approach with the fully-automatic design of an extended depth-of-field computational camera in a cellphone-style form factor, highly aspherical surfaces, and a short back focal length.","Thu, 2 Feb 2023 13:22:18 UTC (28,584 KB)[v2] Thu, 9 Feb 2023 17:01:50 UTC (28,515 KB)"
"8","Modelling exposure between populations using networks of mobility during Covid-19","Tuomas Takko, Kunal Bhattacharya, Kimmo Kaski","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","The use of mobile phone call detail records and device location data for the calling patterns, movements, and social contacts of individuals, has proven to be valuable for devising models and understanding of their mobility and behaviour patterns. In this study we investigate weighted exposure-networks of human daily activities in the capital region of Finland as a proxy for contacts between postal code areas during the pre-pandemic year 2019 and pandemic years 2020, 2021 and early 2022. We investigate the suitability of gravity and radiation type models for reconstructing the exposure-networks based on geo-spatial and population mobility information. For this we use a mobile phone dataset of aggregated daily visits from a postal code area to cellphone grid locations, and treat it as a bipartite network to create weighted one mode projections using a weighted co-occurrence function. We fit a gravitation model and a radiation model to the averaged weekly and yearly projection networks with geo-spatial and socioeconomic variables of the postal code areas and their populations. We also consider an extended gravity type model comprising of additional postal area information such as distance via public transportation and population density. The results show that the co-occurrence of human activities, or exposure, between postal code areas follows both the gravity and radiation type interactions, once fitted to the empirical network. The effects of the pandemic beginning in 2020 can be observed as a decrease of the overall activity as well as of the exposure of the projected networks. In general, the results show that the postal code level networks changed to be more proximity weighted after the pandemic began, following the government imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions, with differences based on the geo-spatial and socioeconomic structure of the areas.","Mon, 9 Jan 2023 20:15:54 UTC (5,992 KB)[v2] Mon, 17 Apr 2023 08:32:47 UTC (5,962 KB)"
"9","A Hierarchical Approach for Investigating Social Features of a City from Mobile Phone Call Detail Records","Fahim Hasan Khan, Mohammed Eunus Ali","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Cellphone service-providers continuously collect Call Detail Records (CDR) as a usage log containing spatio-temporal traces of phone users. We proposed a multi-layered hierarchical analytical model for large spatio-temporal datasets and applied that for the progressive exploration of social features of a city, e.g., social activities, relationships, and groups, from CDR. This approach utilizes CDR as the preliminary input for the initial layer, and analytical results from consecutive layers are added to the knowledge-base to be used in the subsequent layers to explore more detailed social features. Each subsequent layer uses the results from previous layers, facilitating the discovery of more in-depth social features not predictable in a single-layered approach using only raw CDR. This model starts with exploring aggregated overviews of the social features and gradually focuses on comprehensive details of social relationships and groups, which facilitates a novel approach for investigating CDR datasets for the progressive exploration of social features in a densely-populated city.","Sun, 11 Dec 2022 01:39:52 UTC (2,765 KB)"
"10","Human mobility patterns in Mexico City and their links with socioeconomic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic","Oscar Fontanelli, Dulce I. Valdivia, Guillermo Romero, Oliver Medina, Wentian Li, Maribel Hernández-Rosales","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","The availability of cellphone geolocation data provides a remarkable opportunity to study human mobility patterns and how these patterns are affected by the recent pandemic. Two simple centrality metrics allow us to measure two different aspects of mobility in origin-destination networks constructed with this type of data: variety of places connected to a certain node (degree) and number of people that travel to or from a given node (strength). In this contribution, we present an analysis of node degree and strength in daily origin-destination networks for Greater Mexico City during 2020. Unlike what is observed in many complex networks, these origin-destination networks are not scale free. Instead, there is a characteristic scale defined by the distribution peak; centrality distributions exhibit a skewed two-tail distribution with power law decay on each side of the peak. We found that high mobility areas tend to be closer to the city center, have higher population and better socioeconomic conditions. Areas with anomalous behavior are almost always on the periphery of the city, where we can also observe qualitative difference in mobility patterns between east and west. Finally, we study the effect of mobility restrictions due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemics on these mobility patterns.","Fri, 12 Aug 2022 18:51:59 UTC (26,742 KB)"
